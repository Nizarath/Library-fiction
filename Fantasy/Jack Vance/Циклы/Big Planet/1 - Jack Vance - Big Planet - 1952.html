<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Sabotage</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Arthur Hidders, he called himself. He wore
Earth-style clothes, and, except for the length of his hair and his
mustache rings, he looked the complete Earthman— which, in a sense,
he was. His age was indeterminate; the exact panel of races which
had gone into his make-up was a secret six hundred years gone. He
stood an easy five foot six; he was light, with delicate features
centered rather too closely in a large round head, which obviously
held many brains.</p>
<p>  Turning away from the porthole out on space, he
fixed old Pianza with a gaze of almost child-like ingenuousness.
“That’s all very interesting—but doesn’t it seem, well,
futile?”</p>
<p>  “Futile?” Pianza said with great dignity. “I’m
afraid I don’t understand you.”</p>
<p>  Hidders made a careless gesture, taking few pains to
hide his opinion of Pianza: a well-meaning man, perhaps a trifle
dense. “Earth-Central has sent commissions to Big Planet once a
generation for the last five hundred years. Sometimes the
commission returns alive, more often not. In either case nothing is
accomplished. A few investigators lose their lives, much money is
spent, Big Planet tempers—forgive me—are ruffled, and things go on,
regrettably, as before.”</p>
<p>  Pianza, certainly well-meaning, not at all dense,
reflected that Hidders’ air of naivete comported poorly with his
professed occupation of fur-trading. Also, thought Pianza, how
could a Big Planet fur-trader—a naive fur-trader—accumulate the
exchange necessary to buy passage to Earth? He answered gravely.
“What you say is true, but this time perhaps events will turn out
differently.”</p>
<p>  Hidders raised his eyebrows, spread out his hands.
“Has Big Planet changed? Has Earth-Central changed?”</p>
<p>  Pianza looked uneasily around the lounge—empty
except for the nun who sat statue-quiet, the visible section of her
thin white face rapt in meditation. Big Planet lay close ahead; the
Bajarnum of Beaujolais could not possibly know of their approach.
Pianza committed an indiscretion.</p>
<p>  “Conditions are different,” he admitted. “A great
deal different. The former commissions were sent out to—well, let
us say, to soothe Earth consciences. We knew there was murder,
torture, terror on Big Planet; we knew something had to be done.”
He smiled sadly. “The easiest gesture was to send out commissions.
The commissions invariably made the same report: nothing could be
done that was not being done already at the Enclave—unless
Earth-Central wanted to expand, to take full responsibility for Big
Planet.”</p>
<p>  “Interesting,” said Hidders. “You have the gift of
expressing complicated ideas in simple language. And now?”</p>
<p>  Pianza eyed him doubtfully. The butter had become a
little thick. “Now there’s something new on Big Planet: the
Bajarnum of Beaujolais.”</p>
<p>  “Yes, yes—I’ve frequently traveled through his
realms.”</p>
<p>  “Well, on Big Planet there are probably hundreds of
rulers no less cruel, arrogant, arbitrary—but the Bajarnum, as you
certainly must be aware, is expanding his empire, his range of
activities, and not only on Big Planet but elsewhere.”</p>
<p>  “Ah,” said Hidders. “So you come to investigate
Charley Lysidder, Bajarnum of Beaujolais.”</p>
<p>  “Yes,” muttered Pianza. “You might say so. And this
time we have the authority to act.”</p>
<p>  “If he learns of your plans, he will no doubt react
with rancor and violence.”</p>
<p>  “We realize that,” stammered Pianza, wishing now
that he could disavow the conversation. “But I’m sure he won’t
learn until we’re ready.”</p>
<p>  “Perhaps you’re right,” said Hidders gravely. “Let
us hope so.”</p>
<p>  A dark-skinned man of medium height came into the
lounge. His muscles lay close under his skin; he moved quickly,
with sharp definite motions. This was Claude Glystra, Executive
Chairman of the commission.</p>
<p>  Glystra looked swiftly around the lounge,
ice-colored glances, hard, searching, just short of suspicious. He
joined Hidders and Pianza at the porthole, pointed to a flaming
yellow sun close ahead. “There’s Phaedra, we’ll be on Big Planet in
a few hours.”</p>
<p>  A gong rang. “Lunch,” said Pianza, rising with a
feeling of relief. The purpose of the commission was hardly a
secret to anyone aboard the ship; however, he had been
uncomfortably explicit in his talk with Hidders. He was glad to
push the whole matter to the back of his mind.</p>
<p>  Glystra led the way from the saloon, pausing at the
door to let the nun sweep ahead in a billow of black vestments.</p>
<p>  “Peculiar creature,” muttered Pianza.</p>
<p>  Glystra laughed. “There’s no one on Big Planet but
peculiar people; that’s why they’re there. If she wants to convert
them to her own private peculiarity, that’s her privilege.”</p>
<p>  Hidders nodded with lively emphasis. “Perfect
democracy on Big Planet, eh Mr Glystra?”</p>
<p>  Pianza watched expectantly; Glystra was nothing if
not outspoken. Glystra did not fail him.</p>
<p>  “Perfect anarchy, Mr Hidders.”</p>
<p>  In silence they descended the spiral to the dining
saloon, took their places. One by one the other members of the
commission entered. First was Cloyville, big, booming, florid; then
Ketch, dark, drawn and saturnine, like the “Before” in a laxative
advertisement. Next came Bishop, the youngest man on the
commission, sheep-faced and seal-smooth, with a brain full of
erudition and a tendency toward hypochondria. He satisfied the one
with a portable microfilm library, the other with a portable
medicine-chest. Behind him, and last, was Darrot, erect and
military with carrot-colored hair, lips compressed as if against an
imminent outburst of temper.</p>
<p>  The meal was placid, but over-hung with a sense of
excitement, almost tension, which persisted, grew stronger all
afternoon as the bulk of Big Planet spread across the field of
vision. Horizons belled out, blotted Phaedra from the sky, and the
space-ship settled into the darkness.</p>
<p>  There was a shock, a lurch, a perceptible change of
direction. Glystra spun away from the window. The lights flickered,
died, then glowed weakly. Glystra ran up the spiral toward the
bridge. At the top landing stood a squat man in ship’s
uniform—Abbigens, the radio operator and purser. Lank blond hair
hung down his forehead. He watched Glystra’s approach with narrow
eyes set far apart.</p>
<p>  “What’s the trouble?” Glystra demanded sharply.
“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>  “Don’t know, Mr Glystra. I tried to get in myself; I
found the door locked.”</p>
<p>  “The ship feels out of control, as if we’re going to
crash!”</p>
<p>  “Don’t worry your head about that, Mr Glystra. We’ve
got emergency landing gear to set us down—automatic stuff. There
may be a bit of a thump, but if we sit quiet in the saloon we’re
safe enough.”</p>
<p>  Gently he took Glystra’s arm. Glystra shook him off,
returned to the door. Solid as a section of the wall.</p>
<p>  He ran back down the steps, railing at himself for
not taking precautions against just such a chance. To land anywhere
on Big Planet except Earth Enclave meant tragedy, debacle,
cataclysm. He stood in the saloon doorway; there was a babble of
voices, white faces turned to him. Cloyville, Darrot, Pianza,
Bishop, Ketch, Hidders and the nun. All there. He ran to the engine
room; the door opened under his hands. Corbus, the easygoing chief
engineer, pushed him back.</p>
<p>  “We’ve got to get to the life-boats,” barked
Glystra.</p>
<p>  “No more life-boats.”</p>
<p>  “<em>No more life-boats</em>! What’s happened to
them?” Glystra demanded.</p>
<p>  “They’ve been ejected. It’s stick by the ship,
there’s nothing else to do.”</p>
<p>  “But the captain, the mate—”</p>
<p>  “They don’t answer the telephone.”</p>
<p>  “But what on Earth happened?”</p>
<p>  Gorbus’ reply was drowned by a siren which filled
the air, already made mad by the flickering light, with
clangor.</p>
<p>  Abbigens came into the saloon. He looked around with
an air of triumph, nodded toward someone. Who? Glystra twisted his
head. Too late. White faces, open mouths. And now—a picture he
would never forget: the door swung open, the mate staggered in, his
hand held as if he were rubbing his throat. His face was the colour
of raw potato; ghastly dark ribbons striped the front of his
juniper. He pointed a terrible trembling finger at Abbigens. Blood
rasped in his lungs, his knees folded, he fell to the deck. His
hand slipped to show a second mouth under his chin.</p>
<p>  Glystra stared at the squat man with the blond hair
falling thickly down his forehead.</p>
<p>  Dark shadows rushed up past the saloon ports. A
monstrous splintered instant: the floor of the saloon struck up.
The lights went out; there was a hoarse crying.</p>
<p>  Glystra crawled up the floor. He sensed walls
toppling; he saw a sudden dark motion, heard jarring thunder, and
then felt an instant of pain. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Glystra rose toward consciousness like a waterlogged
timber. He opened his eyes; vision reached his brain.</p>
<p>  He lay on a low bed at the rear of a plank-walled
cottage. With a feverish movement he half-raised on the cot,
propped himself on an elbow, stared out the open door, and it
seemed that he was seeing the most wonderful sight of his life.</p>
<p>  He looked out on a green slope, spangled with yellow
and red flowers, which rose to a forest. The gables of a village
showed through the foliage, quaint gables of carved dark-brown
timber. The entire landscape was drenched in a tingling
golden-white radiance; every color shone with jewel-like
clarity.</p>
<p>  Three girls in peasant dress moved across the field
of his vision; they were dancing a merry jig which flung their
belled blue and red skirts back and forth, side to side. Glystra
could hear music, the drone of a concertina, tinkle of mandolin and
guitar.</p>
<p>  He slumped back to the cot, closed his eyes. A
picture from the golden ages. A beautiful dream.</p>
<p>  The thud of footsteps roused him. Watching under
half-cracked eyelids he saw Pianza and Cloyville enter the cottage:
the one tidy, gray, quiet; the other puffing, red-faced, effusive.
Behind came a fresh-faced girl with blonde pigtails, carrying a
tray.</p>
<p>  Glystra struggled up on his elbows again. Pianza
said soothingly, “Relax, Claude. You’re a sick man.”</p>
<p>  Glystra demanded, “Was anyone killed?” He was
surprised to find his voice so weak.</p>
<p>  There was a moment’s silence.</p>
<p>  “Well? Who got it?”</p>
<p>  “The stewards. They had gone to hide in the shell.
And the nun. Apparently she went into her cabin just before the
crash. It’s twenty feet underground now. Of course the captain and
the mate, both with their throats cut.”</p>
<p>  Glystra closed his eyes. “How long has it been?”</p>
<p>  “About four days.”</p>
<p>  He lay passive a few seconds, thinking. “What’s been
happening?”</p>
<p>  “The ship’s a total loss,” said Cloyville. He pulled
out a chair, seated himself. “Broken in three pieces. A wonder any
of us came out alive.”</p>
<p>  The girl laid the tray on the bed, knelt, prepared
to feed Glystra with a horn spoon.</p>
<p>  Glystra looked up ruefully. “Is this what’s been
going on?”</p>
<p>  “You had to be taken care of,” said Pianza. He
patted the girl’s head. “This is Natilien-Thilssa. Nancy for short.
She’s an excellent nurse.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville winked slyly. “Lucky dog.”</p>
<p>  Glystra moved back from the spoon. “I can feed
myself,” he said shortly. He looked up at Pianza. “Where are
we?”</p>
<p>  Pianza frowned slightly, as if he had hoped to avoid
serious discussion. “The village of Jubilith—somewhere near the
northeastern tip of Beaujolais.”</p>
<p>  Glystra pressed his lips together. “It could hardly
be worse. Naturally they planned to drop us closer to Grosgarth,
right into the Bajarnum’s lap.” He struggled up on his elbow. “I’m
astonished we haven’t been taken up already.”</p>
<p>  Pianza looked out the door. “We’re rather isolated,
and naturally there are no communications . . . We’ve been nervous,
I’ll admit.”</p>
<p>  The last terrible scene in the saloon rose before
Glystra’s mind. “Where’s Abbigens?”</p>
<p>  “Abbigens? Oh, he’s gone. Disappeared.”</p>
<p>  Glystra groaned under his breath. Pianza looked
uneasily at Cloyville, who frowned.</p>
<p>  “Why didn’t you kill him?” Glystra moaned.</p>
<p>  All Pianza could do was shake his head. Cloyville
said, “He got away.”</p>
<p>  “There was someone else too,” said Glystra
weakly.</p>
<p>  Pianza leaned forward, his eyes sharp and gray.
“Someone else? Who?”</p>
<p>  “I don’t know. Abbigcns slaughtered the captain and
the mate, the other sabotaged the motors, discharged the
life-boats.” He heaved restlessly on the couch. The girl put a cool
hand on his forehead. “I’ve been unconscious four days.
Extraordinary.”</p>
<p>  “You’ve been sedated,” said Pianza, “to keep you
resting. For a while you were out of your head, climbing out of
bed, fighting, yelling.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Forty-thousand-mile Trek</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Glystra sat up against Nancy’s restraining hand,
felt the base of his skull. He tried to rise to his feet. Cloyville
jumped up. “For Heaven’s sake, Claude, take it easy,” he
admonished.</p>
<p>  Glystra shook his head. “We’ve got to get out of
here. Fast. Think. Where’s Abbigens? He’s gone to report to Charley
Lysidder, the Bajarnum.” He stood swaying. Nancy came to cajole him
back to the cot, but instead, leaning on her shoulder, he went to
the door and stood in the wash of golden-white sunlight, the Big
Planet panorama before him. Pianza brought a chair, Glystra sank
into it.</p>
<p>  The cottage, the forest, the village were situated
halfway up the face of a slope, vast beyond Earthly conception.
Above, Glystra could see no sharp termination or ridge; the land
melted into pale blue distance. Below was a vista so grand and airy
that after the first few miles the eye could sense only the spread
of territory, meadows and forests becoming a green, blue, beige
blur.</p>
<p>  Cloyville stretched his heavy arms out into the
warmth. “Here’s where I’m coming in my old age.” He yawned. “We
never should have wasted Big Planet on the freaks.”</p>
<p>  Nancy slipped into the house with a stiff back.</p>
<p>  Cloyville chuckled. “I guess she thought I was
calling her a freak.”</p>
<p>  “You’ll never have an old age,” said Glystra, “if we
don’t clear out of here.” He looked up and down the slope. “Where’s
the ship?”</p>
<p>  “Up in the forest a little bit.”</p>
<p>  “And how far are we from Beaujolais?”</p>
<p>  Cloyville looked southwest diagonally up the slope.
“The borders of Beaujolais are vague. Over the top of the slope is
a deep valley, apparently volcanic. Full of hot springs, fumaroles,
geysers, so they tell me—the valley of the Glass-Blowers. Last year
the Bajarnum moved in with his troops, and now the valley is part
of Beaujolais. To date he hasn’t sent officials or tax-collectors
to Jubilith, but they’re expected every day, together with a
garrison.”</p>
<p>  “Why a garrison? To keep order?”</p>
<p>  Cloyville gestured down the slope. “Protection
against the nomads—gypsies, they call ’em.”</p>
<p>  “Mmmph.” Glystra looked up at the village. “They
don’t seem to have suffered too much . . . How far is
Grosgarth?”</p>
<p>  “As near as I can make it, two hundred miles south.
There’s a garrison town—Montmarchy, they call it— about fifty miles
southeast along the slope.”</p>
<p>  “Fifty miles.” Glystra considered. “That’s probably
where Abbigens headed for. ...” A heavy metallic crash sounded from
the forest. Glystra looked questioningly at Pianza.</p>
<p>  “They’re cutting up the ship. It’s the most metal
they’ve seen in their lives. We’ve made them all millionaires.”</p>
<p>  “Until the Bajarnum confiscates the whole thing,”
said Cloyville.</p>
<p>  “We’ve got to get out,” Glystra muttered, twisting
in his chair. “We’ve got to get to the Enclave— somehow. ...”</p>
<p>  Pianza pursed his lips doubtfully. “It’s around the
planet, forty thousand miles.”</p>
<p>  Glystra struggled up to his feet. “We’ve got to get
out of here. We’re sitting ducks. If we’re caught, it’s our lives.
Charley Lysidder will make an example of us. . . .Where’s the rest
of the ship’s company?”</p>
<p>  Pianza nodded toward the village. “We’ve been given
a big house. Hidders has gone.”</p>
<p>  “Gone? Where to?”</p>
<p>  “Grosgarth.” He added hastily, “He says hell take a
barge to Marwan Gulf and join one of the beach caravans to
Wale.”</p>
<p>  “Hmmm. The stewards dead, the captain and mate dead,
the nun dead, Abbigens gone, Hidders gone—” he counted on his
fingers “—that leaves eight. The commission and two engine room
officers. You’d better bring them all down here and we’ll have a
council of war.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Eyes troubled, Glystra watched Pianza and Cloyville
climbing to the village, then turned his attention down the slope.
Beaujolain soldiers approaching during the daylight would be
visible for many miles. Glystra gave thanks for the non-metallic
crust of Big Planet. No metal, no machinery, no electricity, no
long distance communication.</p>
<p>  Nancy appeared from the cottage. She had changed her
puffed blue skirt for a parti-colored coverall, a harlequin suit of
red and orange motley. Over her hair she wore a close fitting cap,
set with two-inch spines of hair waxed to golden points.</p>
<p>  Glystra stared a moment. Nancy whirled before him,
pirouetted on one toe, with the other leg bent at the knee.</p>
<p>  Glystra said, “Are all the girls at Jubilith as
lovely as you are?”</p>
<p>  She smiled, tilted her face to the sun. “I’m not
from Jubilith . . . I’m an outlander.”</p>
<p>  “So? From where?”</p>
<p>  She gestured to the north. “From Veillevaux Forest.
My father had the gift, and for many miles people came to ask the
future—even some who might have made the pilgrimage to Myrtlesee
Fountain.”</p>
<p>  “Myrtlesee Fountain?” Glystra opened his mouth to
inquire, then reflected that any explanation would be couched in
the intricacies of a strange culture, and closed his mouth. Best to
listen, to observe, let knowledge come in manageable doses.</p>
<p>  “My father grew rich,” continued Nancy. “He trained
me in the crafts. I travelled to Grosgarth and Calliope and Wale
and through the Stemvelt Canals, and I went outland as a
troubadour, with fine companies, and we saw many towns and castles
and beautiful sights.” She shuddered. “And evil also. Much evil, at
Glaythree . . .” Tears welled into her eyes, her shoulders sagged.
She said forlornly, “When I returned to Veillevaux Forest I found
ruin and desolation. The gypsies from North Heath had raided the
village and burnt the house of my father with all my family inside.
And I wandered here to Jubilith to learn to dance, that I might
dance away my grief. ...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Glystra studied her closely. Marvelous mobility of
feature—sparkle of eye, lilt of voice when she spoke of joy— a
mouth that was never quite in repose. And when she dwelt on her
grief her eyes became large and wistful, and the nervous beauty of
her face and body seemed to become less explicit, glowing from some
wonderful region inside her mind, as light shines from the inner
part of a star.</p>
<p>  “And how is it that you were selected to nurse
me?”</p>
<p>  She shrugged, studied the backs of her hands. “I’m
an outlander; I know the methods of Grosgarth—some of which have
been learned from Earth books. <em>Naisuka</em>.”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked up in puzzlement, repeated the word.
“What is that?”</p>
<p>  “It’s a Beajolais word.” She settled herself to the
ground at his feet, leaned back against the wall, stretched with
the easy looseness of a kitten. “It means—well, it’s what makes a
person decide to do things for no reason whatever.”</p>
<p>  He pointed down the slope. “What country is that
nestled down there?”</p>
<p>  She turned half on her side, propped herself on one
elbow. “The Jubilith claiming ends at the Tsalombar Woods.” She
indicated a far line of forest. “The Tree-people live there, above
the tritchsod.”</p>
<p>  Another idiom unfamiliar to Glystra.</p>
<p>  Up by the village the Earthmen appeared. Glystra
watched their approach. Guilt in any one of them seemed as remote
as guilt in Nancy. But someone had helped Abbigens, someone had
burnt out the motors. Of course it might have been Arthur Hidders,
and he was gone.</p>
<p>  “Sit down,” said Glystra. They took seats on the
turf. Glystra looked doubtfully at Nancy. She smiled up cheerfully,
made no move to rise; indeed, settled herself more comfortably,
stretching her legs, pointing her toes—exotic as a rare bird.</p>
<p>  Glystra hesitated, then turned back to the men.
“We’re in a tough spot, although I suppose I don’t need to belabor
the point.“</p>
<p>  No one spoke.</p>
<p>  “We’re shipwrecked with no possibility of getting
help from Earth. As far as technical superiority goes, we’re no
better off than the people of the village. Maybe worse. They
understand their tools, their materials; we don’t. If we had
unlimited time, we might be able to patch up some kind of radio and
call the Enclave. We don’t have that time. Any minute we can expect
soldiers to take us to Grosgarth. ... In Grosgarth the Bajarnum
will make an example of us. He doesn’t want interference, he’ll
make sure we’re aware of it. We’ve got one chance, that’s to get
out of Beaujolais, put miles behind us.”</p>
<p>  He paused, looked from face to face. Pianza was
mild, non-committal, Cloyville’s big forehead was creased in a
heavy frown, Ketch was petulantly digging at the ground with a bit
of sharp gravel. Bishop’s face was faintly troubled, with little
puckers like inverted V’s over his eyes. Darrot ran a hand through
his sparse red hair, muttered something to Ketch, who nodded.
Corbus the chief engineer sat quietly, as if unconcerned. Vallusser
the second engineer glared, as if Glystra were the cause of his
difficulties. He said in a thick voice, “What happens when we
escape. Where do we escape to? There’s nothing out there—” he waved
his hand down the slope “—but wild men. They’ll kill us. Some of
them are cannibals.”</p>
<p>  Glystra shrugged. “You’re free to do whatever you
like, save your skin the best way you can. Personally I see one way
out. It’s hard, it’s long, it’s dangerous. Maybe it’s impossible.
It’s close to certain not all of us will make it. But we want to
escape with our lives, we want to go home. That means—” he accented
his words heavily “—one place on Big Planet. The Enclave. We’ve got
to get to the Enclave.”</p>
<p>  “Sounds good,” said Cloyville. “I’m all for it. How
do we do it?”</p>
<p>  Glystra grinned. “The only means of locomotion we’ve
got—our feet.”</p>
<p>  “Feet?” Cloyville’s voice rose.</p>
<p>  “Sounds like a pretty stiff hike,” said Darrot.</p>
<p>  Glystra shrugged. “There’s no use fooling ourselves.
We’ve got one chance to get back to Earth—that’s make Earth
Enclave. The only way to get there is to start.”</p>
<p>  “But forty thousand miles?” Cloyville protested
plaintively. “I’m a big man, hard on my feet.”</p>
<p>  “We’ll pick up pack-animals,” said Glystra. “Buy
them, steal them, we’ll get them somehow.”</p>
<p>  “But forty thousand miles,” muttered Cloyville.</p>
<p>  Glystra nodded. “It’s a long way. But if we find the
right kind of river, we’ll float. Or maybe, find a ship, sail
around the coast.”</p>
<p>  “Can’t be done,” said Bishop. “The Australian
Peninsula reaches down, curves back east. We’d have to wait till we
reached Henderland, then cut down, around the Blackstone
Cordillera, to the Parmarbo. And, according to the Big Planet
Almanac, the Parmarbo is virtually unnavigable due to reefs,
pirates, carnivorous sea anemones and weekly hurricanes.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville groaned again. Glystra heard a sound from
Nancy, and looked down, saw her mouth quivering in efforts to
restrain a giggle. He rose to his feet, and Pianza watched him
doubtfully. “How do you feel, Claude?”</p>
<p>  “I’m weak. But tomorrow I’ll be as good as new.
Nothing wrong with me a little exercise won’t cure. One thing we
can be thankful for—”</p>
<p>  “What’s that?” asked Cloyville.</p>
<p>  Glystra motioned to his feet. “Good boots.
Water-proof, wear-proof. We’ll need them.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville ruefully inspected his big torso. “I
suppose the paunch will work off.”</p>
<p>  Glystra glanced around the circle. “Any other ideas?
You, Vallusser?”</p>
<p>  Vallusser shook his head. “I’ll stay with the
crowd.”</p>
<p>  “Good. Now here’s the program. We’ve got to make up
packs. We want all the metal we can conveniently carry; it’s
precious on Big Planet. Each of us ought to be able to manage
fifteen pounds. Tools and knives would be best, but I suppose we’ll
have to take what we can salvage . . . Then we’ll want clothes, a
change apiece. Ship’s chart of Big Planet, if available. A compass.
Everyone had better find himself a good knife, a blanket, and most
important— handweapons. Has anyone checked the ship?”</p>
<p>  Corbus put his hand in his blouse, displayed the
black barrel of an ion-discharge pistol. “This belonged to the
Captain. I helped myself.”</p>
<p>  “I’ve got my two,” said Cloyville.</p>
<p>  “There should be one in my cabin aboard ship,” said
Pianza. “There was no way in yesterday, but maybe I can squeeze in
somehow.”</p>
<p>  “There’s another in mine,” said Glystra. He put his
hands on the arm of the chair, rose to his feet. “We’d better get
started.”</p>
<p>  “You’d better rest,” said Darrot gruffly. “You’ll
need all your strength. I’ll see that your pack is made up.”</p>
<p>  Glystra relaxed without embarrassment. “Thanks.
Maybe we’ll make better time.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The seven men filed uphill, into the forest of silky
blue-green trees. Glystra watched them from the doorway.</p>
<p>  Nancy rose to her feet. “Best now that you should
sleep.”</p>
<p>  He went inside, lowered himself to the cot, put his
hands under his head, lay staring at the beams.</p>
<p>  Nancy stood looking down at him. “Claude
Glystra.”</p>
<p>  “What?”</p>
<p>  “May I come with you?”</p>
<p>  He turned his head, stared up in astonishment. “Come
where?”</p>
<p>  “Wherever you’re going.”</p>
<p>  “Around the planet? Forty thousand miles?”</p>
<p>  “Yes.”</p>
<p>  He shook his head decisively. “You’d be killed with
the rest of us. This is a thousand to one chance.”</p>
<p>  “I don’t care ... I die only once. And I’d like to
see Earth. I’ve wandered far and I know many things . . .” She
hesitated.</p>
<p>  Glystra put the spur to his brain. It was tired and
failed to react. Something was out of place. Would a girl choose
such a precarious life from pure wanderlust? Of course, Big Planet
was not Earth; human psychology was unpredictable. And yet—he
searched her face, was it a personal matter? Infatuation? She
colored.</p>
<p>  “You blush easily,” Glystra observed.</p>
<p>  “I’m strong,” said Nancy. “I can do as much work as
either Ketch or Bishop.”</p>
<p>  “A pretty girl can cause a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>  She shrugged. “There are women everywhere on Big
Planet. No one need be alone.”</p>
<p>  Glystra sank back on the couch, shaking his head.
“You can’t come with us, Nancy.”</p>
<p>  She bent over; he felt her breath on his face, warm,
moist. “Tell them I’m a guide. Can’t I come as far as the
forest?”</p>
<p>  “Very well. As far as the forest.”</p>
<p>  She ran outside, into the golden radiance of the
day.</p>
<p>  Glystra watched her run up the flowered slope.
“There goes trouble.” He turned his face to the wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Free For All</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  He slept an hour, two hours, soaking the rest into
his bones. When he awoke, afternoon sunlight was slanting in
through the doorway, a flood of richest saffron. Up the slope, the
village merry-making was in full swing. Lines of girls and young
men, in parti-colored motley like Nancy’s, capered back and forth
in a dance of light-hearted buffoonery. To his ears came a shrill
jig played on fiddles, concertinas, guitars, rhapsodiums. Back,
forth, across his vision ran the dancers, bounding in a kind of
prancing goose-step.</p>
<p>  Pianza and Darrot looked in through the doorway.
“Awake, Claude?” asked Pianza.</p>
<p>  Glystra swung his feet over the edge of the cot, sat
up. “Good as new.” He stood up, stretched, patted the back of his
head, the soreness had nearly disappeared. “Everything ready?”</p>
<p>  Pianza nodded, “Ready to go. We found your
ion-shine, also a heat-gun belonging to the mate.” He looked at
Glystra half-sidewise, an expression of mild calculation on his
face. “I understand Nancy has been included in the expedition.”</p>
<p>  “No,” said Glystra, with some irritation. “I told
her she might come as far as the forest, that’s only two or three
hours away.”</p>
<p>  Pianza looked doubtful. “She’s made herself up a
pack. Says she’s going with us.”</p>
<p>  Darrot gave his head a terse shake. “I don’t like
it, Claude.” He had a rough baritone voice. It sounded harsh and
grating now. “This march is no place for a girl. Bound to be
friction, inconvenience.”</p>
<p>  Darrot’s cast of mind was peculiarly grim, thought
Glystra. In a conciliatory voice he said, “I’m in full agreement
with you. I refused her point blank.”</p>
<p>  “But she’s all packed,” said Pianza.</p>
<p>  Glystra said tartly, “Well, if she insists on going,
if she follows a hundred yards to the rear, I don’t see how we can
stop her short of physical constraint.”</p>
<p>  Pianza blinked. “Well, naturally. . . .” His voice
trailed off.</p>
<p>  Darrot was unconvinced. His square face wore a look
of mulish displeasure. “She’s travelled widely, she’s been to
Grosgarth. Suppose she’s one of the Bajarnum’s secret agents? I
understand they’re everywhere, even on the other side of the
planet, even on Earth.”</p>
<p>  “It’s possible,” admitted Glystra. “Anything’s
possible. For all I know, you work for the Bajarnum yourself.
Someone does.”</p>
<p>  Darrot snorted, turned away.</p>
<p>  “Don’t worry,” said Glystra, slapping him on the
shoulder. “When we get to the forest, we’ll send her back.” He went
to the door, stepped outside. Much of his strength had returned,
although his legs felt limp and lax.</p>
<p>  Pianza said, “Bishop salvaged the ship’s first aid
kit, and all his food pills and vitamins. They may be useful; our
food won’t always be the best.”</p>
<p>  “Good.”</p>
<p>  “Cloyville found his camping equipment and we’re
taking along the stove and the water-maker.”</p>
<p>  “Any spare power units for the ion-shines?”</p>
<p>  “No.”</p>
<p>  Glystra chewed his lip. “That’s bad . . . Find the
nun’s body?”</p>
<p>  Pianza shook his head. “Her cabin is on the
bottom.”</p>
<p>  “Too bad,” said Glystra, although he felt little
real remorse. The woman had hardly existed as a human being: he had
been conscious of a thin white face, a black robe, a black
head-dress, an air of intensity, and all was now gone.</p>
<p>  Down from the village came the Earthmen, and around
them circled the dancers, gay, exalted, aware only of their own
motion and color. Ketch, Corbus, Vallusser, Cloyville, Bishop—and
Nancy. She stood a little apart, watching the dancing with an air
of serene detachment, as if she had renounced whatever ties bound
her to Jubilith.</p>
<p>  An elder of the village came down the slope, a thin
brown man in a heavy loose smock of horizontal brown, gray and
white stripes. The rhythm was still in his ears; he jigged to the
music following him down the hill.</p>
<p>  He spoke to Cloyville, remonstrated; Cloyville
pointed to Glystra. The old man jigged to where Glystra stood
waiting. He sang out, “Surely you won’t leave us now? The day is at
its close; night drifts over the massif and our merriment is not
yet upon us.”</p>
<p>  Glystra held out his arms while Pianza helped him
into his pack. He said with a grin, “Dance a couple sets for
me.”</p>
<p>  “You’ll be a-dark!”</p>
<p>  “We’ll be a-dark more times than this once.”</p>
<p>  “Inauspicious, importunate.” He broke into a chant
such as children might sing at their games. “The hop-legged sprites
abound in the dark; skin to skin they will weld your legs. Bone to
bone, flesh to flesh, and all your life shall be hop-step-one,
hop-step-one. . . .”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Nancy caught Glystra’s eye, shook her head slightly.
Glystra turned away, looked out over Big Planet, already flooded in
light of a darker gold. Behind him were the dancers in groups of
five, wheeling, kicking out their legs at the knee, wagging their
heads drolly, and the music waxed shrill and happy. Looking down
the vast slope, Glystra suddenly felt weak before the immensity of
the journey ahead. Jubilith seemed warm and secure. Almost like
home. And ahead—distance. Sectors and sections, extents and
expanses. Looking to where Earth’s horizon would lie, he could lift
his eyes and see lands reaching far on out: pencil lines of various
subtle colors, each line a plain or a forest, a sea, a desert, a
mountain range . . . He took a step forward, looked over his
shoulder. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>  For a long time the merry music followed their
backs, and only when the sun passed behind the slope and mauve dusk
came down from the sky did the sounds dwindle to the silence of
distance.</p>
<p>  The way led across the bracken, a thick resilient
mat of gray stalks beaded with dull green nodules. The slope was
gentle and uniform, and the coming of Big Planet night brought no
difficulties; it was only necessary to walk down the fall of the
ground.</p>
<p>  Cloyville and Darrot strode together at the head of
the group; then came Glystra, with Nancy at one elbow and Pianza at
the other. To their left walked Ketch a little apart, and behind
came Bishop, eyes on the ground. At the rear, twenty paces behind,
walked Corbus, striding easily, and Vallusser, picking his way as
if his feet hurt.</p>
<p>  Twilight waned and stars appeared. Now there was
nothing in the world but darkness, the sky, the breast of the
planet and their own infinitesimal persons.</p>
<p>  Nancy had been carefully quiet, but now in the dark,
she pressed closer to Glystra. Glystra, expecting various wiles and
persuasions, grinned to himself and prepared to withstand an
assault on his senses.</p>
<p>  She spoke in a soft low voice. “Tell me, Claude,
which of those stars is Old Sun?”</p>
<p>  Glystra scanned the heavens. The constellations were
strange and made no particular pattern.</p>
<p>  He remembered that on leaving Earth for Big Planet,
Cetus was astern till they arrived at Index . . . There, was Spica,
and nearby the black bulge of the Porridge Pot. “I think that’s the
Sun there—right above the bright white star, in toward the big blot
of fog.”</p>
<p>  She stared wide-eyed into the sky. “Tell me about
Earth.”</p>
<p>  “It’s home,” said Glystra. He looked for several
seconds up at the white star. “I’d like to be there . . .”</p>
<p>  “Is Earth more beautiful than Big Planet?”</p>
<p>  “That’s a hard question to answer. Offhand—no. Big
Planet is—big. Impressive. The Himalayas on Earth are foothills
beside the Sklaemon Range or the Blackstone Cordillera.”</p>
<p>  “Where are they?” Nancy asked.</p>
<p>  Glystra’s mind had been wandering. He looked at her
blankly. “Where are what?”</p>
<p>  “Those mountain ranges? Here on Big Planet?”</p>
<p>  “The Sklaemons are about thirty thousand miles
northwest, in a part of Big Planet called Matador. The Ski-men live
there, I believe. The Blackstone Cordillera is to the southeast,
about five thousand miles above the Australian Peninsula, in
Henderland.“</p>
<p>  “There’s so much to be learned ... So many places to
see ...” Her voice broke a trifle. “The Earth-men know more about
us than we know ourselves. It isn’t fair. You keep us in mental
shackles ...”</p>
<p>  Glystra laughed sourly. “Big Planet is a compromise
of many people’s ideas. Nobody thinks it’s right.”</p>
<p>  “We grow up barbarians,” she said passionately. “My
father—”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked at her quizzically. “A barbarian is
not aware that he is a barbarian.”</p>
<p>  “—was murdered. Everywhere is murder and death. ..
.”</p>
<p>  Glystra tried to hold his voice at a dispassionate
level. “It’s not your fault that this is so—but it’s not the fault
of the Earth people either. We’ve never attempted to exercise
authority past Virginis Reef. Anyone passing through is on his
own—and his children pay the price.”</p>
<p>  Nancy shook her head—a kind of personal little jerk
with head cocked sidewise, indicating incomplete conviction.</p>
<p>  Glystra tried to think. There was little he could
say to her that was concrete and definite. He detested human pain
and misery as whole-heartedly as she did. He was equally convinced
that Earth could maintain authority only through a finite volume of
space. It was likewise impossible to prevent people who so desired
to pass the boundaries and declare themselves free of supervision.
He also admitted that in such a case, many might suffer from the
mistakes of a few. It was an injustice arising from the very nature
of human beings. Nancy had known the injustice—the murder, the
grief, the anger, the aberrations which reinforcing and building up
down the generations, now infected tribes, peoples, races,
continents, the entire world. These immediacies would be in the
forefront of her mind; his problem was to convey a sense of
more-and-less relationships, to endow these vaguenesses and
conditionals with enough power to counter the force of her
emotion.</p>
<p>  “On Earth, Nancy, ever since our first archaic
histories, the race has graduated into levels. Some people have
lived in complete harmony with their times, others have in their
core a non-conformist independence—an apparently built-in trait, a
basic emotion like hunger, fear, affection. These people are
unhappy and insecure in a rigid society; through all the ages they
have been the unclassifiables: the pioneers, explorers,
flagpole-sitters; the philosophers, the criminals, the prophets of
doom, and the progenitors of new cultural complexes.
Akhnaton—Brigham Young— Wang Tsi-po—John D’Arcy. . . .”</p>
<p>  They walked on through the dark. The matted bracken
crackled underfoot, muffled voices sounded ahead and behind
them.</p>
<p>  The air was cool and warm at once—balmy, soothing,
smelling of a peppery lavender from the bracken.</p>
<p>  Nancy, still watching Old Sun, said, “But these
people whoever they were, they have nothing to do with Big
Planet.”</p>
<p>  “Jubilith,” said Glystra, “was founded by a ballet
troupe who apparently desired solitude and peace to perfect their
art. Perhaps they only intended to come out for a year or two, but
they stayed. The first settlers, almost six hundred years ago, were
nudists—people who dislike the wearing of clothes. Convention on
Earth forbids nudity. So they bought a ship and went exploring past
the edge of the System. They found Big Planet. At first they
thought it too big to be habitable—”</p>
<p>  “Why should that be?”</p>
<p>  “Gravity,” said Glystra. “The larger a planet is,
the stronger the pull of its gravity. But Big Planet is made of
light materials with a specific gravity only a third of Earth’s.
Earth is a very dense planet, with abundant metals and heavy
elements, and so the gravity works out about the same—although
there’s thirty times the volume here . . . The nudists liked Big
Planet. It was paradise— sunny, bright, with a mild climate,
and—most essential it had an organic complex similar to that of
Earth. In other words Big Planet proteins were not incompatible
with Earth protoplasm. They settled here, and sent back to Earth
for their friends.</p>
<p>  “There was room for other minorities—endless room.
Out they migrated—all the cults, misanthropic societies,
primitivists, communists, religious monasteries, just people in
general. Sometimes they built towns, sometimes they lived by
themselves—a thousand, two thousand, five thousand miles from their
nearest neighbor. Useful ore deposits are non-existent on Big
Planet; technical civilization never had a chance to get started,
and Earth refused to allow the export of modern weapons to Big
Planet. So Big Planet evolved into a clutter of tiny states and
cities, with stretches of open country in between.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Nancy started to speak, but Glystra anticipated her.
“Yes, we might have organized Big Planet and given it System law.
But—in the first place—it is beyond the established boundaries of
the System. Secondly, we would thereby have been defeating the
purpose of those people who sacrificed their place on the civilized
worlds for independence—a perfectly legitimate aim in itself.
Thirdly, we would be denying refuge to other restless souls, with
the effect of sending them out seeking other worlds, almost
inevitably less propitious. So we let Big Planet become the
System’s Miscellaneous File. We established Earth Enclave, with the
university and trade school, for those who wish to return to Earth.
But very few apply.”</p>
<p>  “Of course not,” said Nancy scornfully. “It’s
forbidden. A place of maniacs.”</p>
<p>  “Why do you say that?”</p>
<p>  “It is well known. Once a Bajarnum of Beaujolais
went to the Enclave, he attended the school, and he came back a
different man. He freed all the slaves, and stopped all the
punishment ordeals. When he declared the land-hold system void, the
College of Dukes rose up and killed him, because clearly he was
mad.”</p>
<p>  Glystra smiled wanly. “He was the sanest man on the
planet. ...”</p>
<p>  She sniffed.</p>
<p>  “Yes,” said Glystra. “Very few apply to the Enclave.
Big Planet is home. It’s free—open—limitless. A man can find any
kind of life he wants, even if he may be killed almost any minute.
Anyone with Big Planet in his blood never feels loose on the
civilized worlds. On Earth and the other planets of the System we
have a rigid society with precise conventions. It’s smooth and easy
now; most of the misfits have gone to Big Planet.”</p>
<p>  “Dull,” said Nancy. “Stupid and dull.”</p>
<p>  “Not entirely,” said Glystra. “After all, there are
five billion people on Earth, and no two of them are
identical.”</p>
<p>  Nancy was silent a moment, then, almost as a taunt:
“What of the Bajarnum of Beaujolais? He plans to conquer the
planet. He’s already expanded Beajolais threefold.“</p>
<p>  Glystra looked straight ahead, down through the
infinite Big Planet night. “If the Bajarnum of Beaujolais or the
Nomarch of Skene or the Gaypride Baron or the Nine Wizards or
anyone else dominates Big Planet, then the inhabitants of Big
Planet have lost their freedom and flexibility even more certainly
than if the System organized a federal government. Because then
they would be obliged to adapt their lives to aberrations different
from their own, and not merely to a few rules and regulations
essentially rational.”</p>
<p>  She was not convinced. “I’m surprised that the
System considered the Bajarnum important enough to worry
about.”</p>
<p>  Glystra smiled thinly. “Just the fact of our being
here tells you something about the Bajarnum. He’s got spies and
agents everywhere—including Earth. He regularly violates our number
one law—the embargo on weapons and metal to Big Planet.”</p>
<p>  “A man is killed just as surely with a birkwood
sword as with a shaft of light.”</p>
<p>  Glystra shook his head. “You are considering only
one aspect of the subject. Where do these weapons come from? The
System prohibits unlicensed manufacture of weapons. It’s very
difficult establishing a modern factory in secret, and therefore
most of the Bajarnum’s weapons are stolen or pirated. Ships and
depots are ripped open, men killed or herded into slave-bins, bound
out for the One-man Heavens.”</p>
<p>  “One-man Heavens? What are they?”</p>
<p>  “Among these five billion I mentioned a minute ago
are some very strange people,” said Glystra thoughtfully. “Not all
the odd ones have migrated to Big Planet. We have over-rich
over-ripe creatures on Earth with too much self-indulgence and not
enough conscience. Many of them have found a little world somewhere
off in the cluster and set themselves up as gods. The pirates sell
them slaves and out on their little domains there’s no kind of
indulgence or whimsicality they can’t allow themselves. After two
or three months they return to the System and function as
respectable citizens for a period. Then they tire of the
cosmopolis, and it’s back to their One-man Heaven out in the
star-stream.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Eight Against an Army</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Nancy remained silent. “What’s that got to do with
Charley Lysidder?”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked at her sidewise, and she saw his face
as a white mask in the darkness. “How does the Bajarnum pay for his
smuggled weapons? They’re expensive. Lots of blood and pain is
spent on every ion-shine.”</p>
<p>  “I don’t know ... I never thought of it.”</p>
<p>  “There’s no metal on Big Planet, few jewels. But
there’s trade-goods more valuable.”</p>
<p>  Nancy said nothing.</p>
<p>  “Girls and boys.”</p>
<p>  “Oh. . . .” in a remote voice.</p>
<p>  “Charley Lysidder is like a carrier of the plague
and he infects half the universe.”</p>
<p>  “But—what can you do?”</p>
<p>  “I don’t know—now. Events have not gone according to
plan.”</p>
<p>  “You are only eight men. Futile against the
Beaujolais army.”</p>
<p>  Glystra smiled. “We never intended to fight.”</p>
<p>  “You have no weapons, no plans, no documents—”</p>
<p>  “Just brains.”</p>
<p>  Nancy subsided into a silence of a quality which
caused Glystra to peer at her quizzically. “You’re not
impressed?”</p>
<p>  “I don’t know. I’m—very inexperienced.”</p>
<p>  Glystra once more sought her face through the
darkness, this time to make sure she was serious. “We form a team.
Each man is a specialist. Pianza here—” he nodded to the gray shape
at his left “—is an organizer and administrator. Ketch records our
findings on his camera and sonographs. Darrot is an ecologist—”</p>
<p>  “What’s that?”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked ahead to where Cloyville and Darrot
walked, and the sound of their footsteps came as a regular double
thud-crackle. They were now entering a country clumped with great
trees, and ahead loomed the Tsalom-bar Woods, a line of black
heavier than the sky. “Ecology,” said Glystra, “is ultimately
concerned with keeping people fed. Hungry people are angry and
dangerous.”</p>
<p>  In a subdued voice Nancy said, “The gypsies are
always hungry . . . They killed my father. ...”</p>
<p>  “Cloyville is our mineralogist. I’m coordinator and
propagandist.” Anticipating her question, he asked, “Why is the
Bajarnum able to conquer his neighbors?”</p>
<p>  “Because he has a stronger army . . . He’s very
crafty.”</p>
<p>  “Suppose his army no longer obeyed him. Suppose no
one on Big Planet paid any attention to his orders. What could he
do?”</p>
<p>  “Nothing. He’d be powerless.”</p>
<p>  “Propaganda at its maximum effectiveness
accomplishes just that. I work with Bishop. Bishop is a student of
culture—human society. He can look at an arrowhead and tell you
whether the man who made it had six wives or shared a wife with six
men. He can study the background of people and discover their
racial aberrations, their push-buttons—the ideas that make them
react like herds of—” he was about to say “sheep” but remembered
that Big Planet harbored no sheep—“herds of pechavies.”</p>
<p>  She looked at him half-smiling. “And you can make
people behave like pechavies?”</p>
<p>  Glystra shook his head. “Not exactly. Or I should
say, not all the time.”</p>
<p>  They marched onward down the slope. The trees loomed
in closer and they entered Tsalombar Forest. Around him marched
eight dark shapes. There were forty thousand miles to travel—and
one of these shapes wished him evil. He said under his breath to
Nancy, “Someone here—I don’t know who—is my enemy. Somehow, I’ve
got to learn who he is. . . .”</p>
<p>  She had stopped breathing. “Are you sure?” she asked
in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>  “Yes.”</p>
<p>  “What will he do?”</p>
<p>  “If I knew, I’d watch for it.”</p>
<p>  “The Magic Fountain at Myrtleseee could tell you who
he is. He knows everything.”</p>
<p>  Glystra searched his mind. Myrtlesee—a word on a
map. “Where’s Myrtlesee?”</p>
<p>  She gestured. “Far to the east. I’ve never been
there; it’s a dangerous journey unless you ride the monoline, and
that costs much metal. My father told me of the oracle at the
Fountain. He babbles in a frenzy and answers any questions asked
and then he dies whereupon the Dongmans select a new oracle.”</p>
<p>  Glystra was skeptical. “There have been similar
oracles on Earth. They are drugged and their ravings are
interpreted as prophecy.”</p>
<p>  “It’s rather strange. . . .”</p>
<p>  Ahead of them Cloyville and Darrot stopped short.
“Quiet!” hissed Darrot. “There’s a camp ahead. Fires.”</p>
<p>  The sighing branches of Tsalombar Forest shut off
the sky and the darkness was near-complete. Ahead a tiny spark of
red flickered past the ranked tree trunks.</p>
<p>  “Would it be the Tree-men?” Glystra asked Nancy.</p>
<p>  She said doubtfully, “No . . . They never come down
from the trees. And they never build fires; they’re deathly afraid
of fire ...”</p>
<p>  “Then,” said Glystra, “it is probably a party sent
out to capture us.”</p>
<p>  “Or gypsies,” said Nancy.</p>
<p>  Glystra said, “Everybody come here, close.” Dark
shapes stepped forward.</p>
<p>  Glystra said in a low hurried voice, “I’m going
ahead to reconnoiter. I want everyone to stay together. This is
emphatic. No one is to move from this group or make a sound until I
return. Nancy, you stand at the center; the rest of you stand with
your elbows touching. Make sure who is on either side of you, make
sure he doesn’t move.”</p>
<p>  He circled the group. “Everybody touching two
others? Good. Count off.” The names came softly across the
darkness.</p>
<p>  “I’ll be back as soon as possible,” said Glystra.
“If I need help—I’ll yell. So keep your ears open.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The matted bracken crackled under his feet as he
stole down the slope.</p>
<p>  It was a large fire, a roaring blaze fed by logs, in
the center of a clearing. Fifty or sixty men sprawled around the
fire, completely at their ease. They wore a loose blue uniform of
baggy breeches triced below the knee, smocks gathered at the waist
by a black sash. On their chest they wore a red insignia, a
triangle apex-down. They carried knives and catapults in their
sash; squat baskets heavy with darts hung at their backs. Some of
the men wore hats of black felt, bent, twisted, creased in
flamboyant flaps and bellies; others went bare-headed with their
hats laid nearby on the ground.</p>
<p>  They were a rough crew—short and stocky with flat
brown faces, little spade beards, narrow-lidded eyes, hooked noses.
They had eaten and now were drinking from black kidney-shaped
leather sacks. Discipline at the moment was lax.</p>
<p>  A little apart, back turned to the noise, stood a
man in a black uniform. Glystra saw with unreasonable surprise that
it was Abbigens. He conversed with a man evidently the
officer-in-charge, apparently instructing him, emphasizing points
with motions of his big pale hands. The officer listened,
nodded.</p>
<p>  Not far from Glystra a train of odd-looking beasts
waited restlessly, swinging their long necks, snapping at the air,
mumbling and moaning. They were narrow-shouldered, high in the back
with six powerful legs and a narrow trustworthy-looking head, a
composite of camel, horse, goat, dog, lizard. The driver had not
bothered to remove their packs. With sudden interest, Glystra
examined the loads they bore.</p>
<p>  One carried three metal cylinders, another a squat
barrel and a bundle of metal rods. Glystra recognized the
mechanism: a knock-down ion-blast, a field-piece capable of
smashing Jubilith flat. It was of Earth manufacture, captured in a
merciless little skirmish on an outer world, bought in blood, sold
for young flesh . . . Glystra looked behind, through the trees,
suddenly uneasy. Strange that no sentries had been posted.</p>
<p>  A flurry of activity at one side of the clearing
caught his attention. A dozen soldiers stood with craned necks,
looking up, pointing, talking excitedly. Glystra followed their
gaze. A hundred feet overhead was a village—a network of rude
trestles, walkways swung on vines, pendant huts swaying like oriole
nests. No light showed, the huts were dark, but over the side of
the trestles peered several dozen white faces framed in a tousle of
brown hair. They made no sound, moved but little, and then like
squirrels, quickly, abruptly. Apparently the Beaujolais soldiers
had not previously noticed the village. Glystra peered up again.
They had found a girl—whey-faced, bleary-eyed, but still a girl.
They shouted up taunts and jocularities, to which the tree-men made
no response.</p>
<p>  Glystra eyed the pack-animals with interest,
estimating the chances of leading them into the forest while
attention was diverted by the girl in the tree-village. He decided
they were scant. Perhaps when they bedded down for the night . . .
For the night? Why should they bed down for the night? Jubilith was
three or four hours up-slope. More likely they had camped here to
await nightfall before venturing out on the moors where they could
be seen from the village.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Where the soldiers were baiting the tree-men there
was further activity. A young swaggerer with a spike mustache was
climbing a rude ladder toward the hut from which hung the head of
the slatternly girl. The way was easy; where a branch angled up,
steps were cut into the wood. The soldier, spurred by the approving
hoots of his comrades, ran up the trunk, paused on a rude platform.
Here he was partly veiled by the branches, camouflaged by the
flickering firelight shadows. There was a motion, a swishing sound,
a thud, a sound of disturbed branches. A sprawling twisting body
plunged down from the shadows, landed with a heavy thump.</p>
<p>  Glystra jerked back, startled. The event had taken
him unaware. He looked up; there was no motion from the
tree-village. The faces stared down as before. Apparently the
soldier had sprung a trap. A poised weight had swept down, struck
him from the platform. Now he lay moaning, writhing. His fellows
stood around him, watching dispassionately. There were glances
turned up at the tree-men, but without apparent animus or
hostility. There was no clamor for revenge, no threats, no fury.
The event had occurred; it was fate. . . .</p>
<p>  Abbigens and the officer strode over, stood looking
down at the fallen man. He choked back his groans, lay silent,
staring up white-faced. The officer spoke; Glystra could hear the
tone of his voice but could not distinguish the words. The soldier
on the ground made a reply, tried to rise to his feet, an anguished
effort. But his leg lay out at a curious angle; tilting his chin,
gritting his teeth, he lay back.</p>
<p>  The officer spoke to Abbigens; Abbigens looked up at
the tree-men. They watched from the walkways with wary interest.
Abbigens spoke, gesturing up at the tree-village. The officer
shrugged, turned aside, made a motion to one of the soldiers,
turned away.</p>
<p>  The soldier looked down at his comrade on the
ground, muttered resentfully. He drew his sword from the sheath,
stabbed the fallen man through the chest, the neck, finally up
through the eye socket.</p>
<p>  Behind the tree Glystra swallowed the lump in his
throat. After a moment he was once more able to see the
clearing.</p>
<p>  The officer strode back and forth through the camp,
barking orders, and the words were loud enough for Glystra to hear:
“Up, up on your feet. Form ranks, double-quick, we’ve overstayed.
Driver, see to your beasts—”</p>
<p>  Abbigens came forward, spoke briefly to the officer.
The officer nodded, crossed the clearing. Glystra could not hear
his orders, but the soldier who was tending the pack animals led
aside the two beasts bearing the knockdown ion-blast. He removed
the packs, assembled the weapon.</p>
<p>  Glystra watched with narrow eyes. Was the ion-blast
to be used against the tree-village? He looked up. The faces were
as before, white blotches peering down from the walkways. One of
them looked at him, stared closely a moment, then turned his head
back to the clearing without further attention.</p>
<p>  The ion-blast was assembled, mounted on its tripod.
Firelight glinted on the smooth metal barrel. The cannoneer
swivelled the tube back and forth to test the bearing, rocked it up
and down checking the balance. He threw off the safety, set the
valve, pulled the trigger. A line of violet light lanced from the
nozzle, power cracked down the lane of ionized air, spattered into
the turf.</p>
<p>  Testing. The weapon was ready for use.</p>
<p>  The cannoneer set the safety, went to the line of
pack-animals, selected the strongest beast, yanked at the straps
holding the pack to his back. The driver came forward angrily and
the two fell into dispute.</p>
<p>  Glystra moved, hesitated, started up, fell back. He
gathered himself angrily. Boldness. Take a chance. He stepped
forward, heart in mouth, moved out into the firelight. He swung the
weapon around, opened the nozzle into a narrow gape, threw off the
safety. It was so simple as to be ridiculous.</p>
<p>  One of the soldiers noticed him, uttered a sharp
cry, pointed.</p>
<p>  “Stand still!” Glystra called out in a loud clear
voice. “If anyone moves—I’ll burn him in two.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Capture</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Around the clearing shapes froze, startled faces
looked in his direction. Yelling in fury, the cannoneer sprang
forward. Glystra pulled the trigger; the fan of violet light spread
out, power crackled along the conductive air. The cannoneer was
shattered and with him five others in the spread of the blaster’s
fan.</p>
<p>  Glystra lifted his voice. “Pianza! Cloyville!”</p>
<p>  No reply.</p>
<p>  He called again, as loudly as he could, and waited,
watching across the sights of the blaster.</p>
<p>  None of the soldiers moved. Abbigens stared with his
pasty face flat, his eyes like a pair of olives.</p>
<p>  There was a rustle of footsteps behind. “Who is it?”
asked Glystra.</p>
<p>  “Will Pianza—and the rest of us.”</p>
<p>  “Good. Get around to the side, where you’ll be out
of range.” He raised his voice. “Now—you Beaujolains. Move to the
center, this side of the fire . . . <em>Quick</em>!” He charged his
voice with the push-button crackle of authority.</p>
<p>  Glumly the soldiers sidled into the center of the
clearing. Abbigens took three quick steps along with them, but
Glystra’s voice halted him.</p>
<p>  “Abbigens—put your hands on your head, walk
backwards toward me. Quick, now. . . .”</p>
<p>  Glystra said aside to Pianza, “Get his weapon.” He
snapped to the officer who was quietly shifting toward the rear of
the cluster of men. “You—come forward, hands on your head.” From
the corner of his mouth: “One of you—Corbus—search him.”</p>
<p>  Corbus stepped forward. Vallusser made as if to
follow. Glystra snapped, “You others stand where you are . . . This
is ticklish.”</p>
<p>  Abbigens carried an ion-shine, the officer a
rocket-pistol.</p>
<p>  Glystra said, “Put the guns on the ground, tie ’em
up with pack ropes.”</p>
<p>  Abbigens and the officer lay helpless. The soldiers
stood swaying, muttering in the center of the clearing.</p>
<p>  “Nancy,” called Glystra over his shoulder.</p>
<p>  “Yes,”—in a tight breathless voice.</p>
<p>  “Do exactly as I say. Pick up those two weapons—by
their barrels. Bring them to me. Don’t walk between the blaster and
the soldiers. I don’t want to kill you.”</p>
<p>  Nancy walked across the clearing to where the
weapons glittered on the ground, bent.</p>
<p>  “<em>By the barrel</em>!” rasped Glystra.</p>
<p>  She hesitated, turned him an odd wide-eyed look, the
skin below the ridge of her cheek-bones tight and pale. Glystra
watched her stonily. Trust no one. She bent, gingerly picked up the
guns, brought them to him. He dropped them into his pouch, looked
warily into the faces of his companions. Behind one of the faces
was furious scheming . . . Behind which face? Now was a critical
moment. Whoever it was would seek to get behind him, pull him away
from the blaster . . .</p>
<p>  He gestured. “I want all of you to stand over there,
to the side.” He waited till all his companions stood to the side
of the clearing. “Now,” he said to the soldiers. “One at a time,
cross the clearing ...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Half an hour later the soldiers squatted in a tight
circle facing inward, a sullen slack-faced group. Abbigens and the
officer lay where they had been tied, Abbigens watching Glystra
with expressionless eyes. Glystra watched Abbigens also, watched
the direction of his glances. Would they seek out his ally?</p>
<p>  Pianza looked doubtfully across the clot of
prisoners. “This poses quite a problem . . . What are you planning
to do with them?”</p>
<p>  Glystra standing behind the blaster, relaxed a
trifle, stretched. “Well—we can’t let them loose. If we can keep
the news of this episode away from the Bajarnum, we gain a big head
start.” Together they surveyed the prisoners, and above the rumpled
blue uniforms eyes fearfully reflected back the firelight. “It
becomes a choice of killing them or taking them with us.”</p>
<p>  Pianza snapped his head around in alarm. “Take them
with us? Is that—feasible?”</p>
<p>  “Down the slope a few miles begins the steppe.
Nomadland. If there’s any fighting to be done, perhaps we can
persuade them to do it for us.”</p>
<p>  “But—we have the blaster. We don’t need swords and
darts.”</p>
<p>  “What good is a blaster if we’re ambushed? Jumped
from two or three sides at once? The blaster is a fine weapon when
you can see your target.”</p>
<p>  Pianza shrugged. “It may be difficult to manage
them.”</p>
<p>  “I’ve considered that. Through the forest we’ll tie
them together. Once out on the steppes they can march ahead of the
blaster. Naturally we’ll have to be carefull.”</p>
<p>  He set the safety on the blaster, nosed the barrel
down into the bracken, then strolled to where Abbigens lay. He
looked down. “Think it’s about time to talk?”</p>
<p>  Abbigens drew back the corners of his wide flat
mouth. “Sure, I’ll talk, What do you want to know?”</p>
<p>  Glystra smiled thinly. “Who helped you aboard the
<em>Vittorio</em>?”</p>
<p>  Abbigens looked down the line of faces: Pianza,
placid, attentive; the bristling Darrot; Bishop, solemn, a man
ludicrously out of place; Ketch; Corbus; Vallusser; and lastly
Nancy, standing wide-eyed by Glystra’s left elbow.</p>
<p>  “Pianza,” said Abbigens. “That’s the man.”</p>
<p>  Pianza raised his mild white eyebrows in startled
protest. Somewhere else along the line of faces there was a change
of expression—a flicker so faint as to be gone even as it
manifested itself.</p>
<p>  Glystra abruptly turned away. From the corner of his
eye he sensed dark shapes disappearing into the trees. The
Beaujolais soldiers! How many? Two, three, four? Taking advantage
of the Earthman’s preoccupation they had slipped across the
clearing, disappeared into the woods.</p>
<p>  Glystra cursed. If even one got away, the advantage
of their head-start was diminished. He snatched the ion-shine from
his pouch, slowly replaced it. It would be foolish wasting power on
the tree trunks. The footsteps died in the distance, and then there
was silence.</p>
<p>  Glystra stood still, trying to collect his wits. At
the moment there was only one person he was sure of— himself.</p>
<p>  He pointed to Darrot and Corbus. “You two man the
blaster. Neither of you trust the other. There’s an enemy among us,
we don’t know who he is, and we can’t give him the Opportunity to
destroy us all.” He took a step backwards, held his ion-shine
ready. “I want to locate the weapons in the crowd. Pianza, you have
an ion-shine?”</p>
<p>  “Yes. One of Cloyville’s.”</p>
<p>  “Turn your back on me, lay it on the ground.”</p>
<p>  Pianza did so, without remonstrance. Glystra stepped
forward, ran his hand over Pianza’s body, into his pouch. He found
no other weapon.</p>
<p>  In a similar fashion Glystra took the ion-shine from
Cloyville, the mate’s heat-gun from Ketch. Vallusser and Bishop
carried only knives. Nancy carried no weapon of any sort.</p>
<p>  Tucking the weapons into his pouch he stepped behind
the blaster, took the ion-shine from Corbus. Five ion-shines,
counting Abbigens’, and the mate’s heat-gun.</p>
<p>  “Now we’re as toothless as possible, and I think we
ought to try for some sleep. Ketch, you and Vallusser take a couple
of swords, stand on each side of the clearing. Make a triangle with
the blaster. Don’t get in between the blaster and the soldiers,
because if anything happens— you’re gone.” He turned to Darrot and
Corbus. “Hear that? Use that blaster if there’s even a hint of an
excuse.”</p>
<p>  “Right,” said Corbus. Darrot nodded.</p>
<p>  He looked at Nancy, Pianza, Bishop. “We’ll try for
some sleep now and stand the second watch . . . Right there by the
fire is a good place, out of range of the blaster.”</p>
<p>  The bracken was soft and comfortable under the
blanket where the firelight had warmed it. Glystra stretched
himself down, and fatigue came rising from his bones and muscles,
and for an instant he was almost dazed by the pleasant ache of
relaxation.</p>
<p>  He lay ruminating, hands under his head. Above him
the white blotches still peered over the walkways, and for all he
could see they had not moved since he had seen them first.</p>
<p>  Bishop settled himself nearby, sighed. Glystra eyed
him with a moment’s pity. Bishop was a student, fastidious, with no
natural inclination for roughing it ... Nancy returned from the
forest. Glystra had watched her go with an instant suspicion and
then had relaxed. It was impractical to supervise every waking
moment of everyone. He must remember, he told himself, to send her
home to Jubilith the first thing in the morning. He closed his
eyes, opened them a crack. Languor came at him in billows,
delightful warmth leaching his consciousness. He lay on his side,
one arm thrown over his eyes. It was difficult keeping himself
awake.</p>
<p>  “Awake or dead,” Glystra thought. “Awake or dead.”
And he forced his eyes open. Darrot, Corbus, Ketch, Vallusser. It
was not that he trusted them the less, but that he was
instinctively sure of Nancy, Pianza and Bishop.</p>
<p>  There was no sound in the clearing other than the
low mutter from the cluster of soldiers. Darrot and Corbus stood
stiff behind the ionic blaster, Ketch paced slowly along one side
of the clearing, Vallusser along the other. Behind him Nancy lay
still and warm, Bishop slept like a baby, Pianza tossed
fretfully.</p>
<p>  All in all, quiet and peaceful. But the air was
heavy with someone’s private tension—his misgivings, fear,
vacillation. The tension permeated the clearing, held Glystra’s
languor at bay.</p>
<p>  The tension grew and Glystra tried to place it
objectively. In Corbus’ tight alertness, in Darrot’s rigidity? In
the feel of Nancy at his back? Some subtle wrongness in the
breathing of Bishop or Pianza? . . . What had aroused him he could
not determine, but he sensed a focus of action forming. As soon as
someone could summon the courage. He tried to see whom Abbigens
might be watching, without success.</p>
<p>  Minutes passed, a quarter hour, a half hour. The air
was brittle as ice.</p>
<p>  Ketch took a couple of steps toward the blaster,
signalled, muttered a few words, backed off into the woods. Glystra
watched without seeming to watch as Ketch attended the needs of his
body. The soldiers noting Ketch’s momentary preoccupation, reacted
with a small ripple of motion. A curt monosyllable from Darrot
froze them.</p>
<p>  Ketch returned, and now Vallusser stepped into the
woods. Again from the captives the quiver of alertness, and again
Darrot’s soft command and the slow subsidence of blue-clad
shoulders, the sinking of the grotesque black felt hats.</p>
<p>  A sudden shape behind the blaster, a sweep of sword,
a startled cry, a bubble of pure pain . . . Then a stamp of feet, a
stabbing flash of steel.</p>
<p>  Teeth grinding together, Glystra leapt to his feet,
ion-shine in his hand.</p>
<p>  At the blaster there was now but one man, crouching,
swinging the tube toward Glystra. Glystra saw it coming, saw the
elbows tense . . . He squeezed the handle of his ion-shine.
Crackling electric streaks down the violet ray. Man’s head charred,
shriveled; blaster smashed, flung askew. Glystra sprang about
facing the soldiers. They had raised to their feet, stood poised,
undecided whether to attack or flee.</p>
<p>  “<em>Sit down</em>!” said Glystra, his voice
rasping, deadly. The soldiers slumped instantly.</p>
<p>  Glystra reached in his pouch, tossed weapons to
Pianza, Bishop. “Watch ’em from here; we don’t have any more
blaster.”</p>
<p>  He strode to the shattered field weapon. Three
bodies. Corbus was still alive. Darrot lay with his dead face
turned up, frozen in rage. Vallusser’s body, with the head like an
oversized black walnut, sprawled across Darrot’s legs.</p>
<p>  Glystra looked down at the bent little body. “So it
was Vallusser the man-hater. I wonder what they bought him
with.”</p>
<p>  Ketch had unpacked the first-aid kit and they knelt
beside Corbus. A thrust through the side of his neck was bleeding
profusely. Glystra applied a clotting agent, antiseptic and sprayed
an elastic film over the wound, which when dry would grip the edges
of the cut close together.</p>
<p>  He rose to his feet, stood looking down at Abbigens.
“Your usefulness is limited. I’ve found out what I wanted to
know.”</p>
<p>  Abbigens shook the thick yellow hair back out of his
face. “Are you going to—kill me?”</p>
<p>  “Wait and see.” Glystra turned away. He looked at
his watch. “Twelve o’clock.” He tossed Corbus’ ion-shine to Ketch,
turned to Pianza and Bishop. “You two sleep; we’ll take it till
three.” He felt alive, refreshed. His enemy had been discovered and
dealt with; the pressure of his most immediate problem had been
lifted off his mind. Of course, tomorrow would bring new problems .

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>The Gypsies</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Darrot and Vallusser were buried in a common grave
with the Beaujolains: the young swaggerer who had fallen from the
tree and the six soldiers who had been killed when Glystra had
first seized the blaster.</p>
<p>  Abbigens heaved a great sigh when earth began to
fall on the bodies. Glystra grinned. Evidently Abbigens had
expected to be one with the seven.</p>
<p>  Shafts of sunlight, heavy and bright as bars of
luminex, prodded down at a slant through the foliage. Pale smoke
drifted up from the ashes of the campfire. It was almost time to
leave.</p>
<p>  Glystra looked around the clearing. Where was Nancy?
There she stood, by the pack-beasts, as inconspicuous as she was
able to make herself. Behind her the tree-trunks rose like the
columns of a great temple, admitting brief glimpses of the sunlit
slope.</p>
<p>  Nancy felt Glystra’s eye, turned him her quick wide
glance, with a hopeful hesitant smile. Glystra felt his heart
beating. He looked away. Corbus was watching him with an unreadable
expression. He compressed his lips, strode forward.</p>
<p>  “You’d better be on your way, Nancy—back to
Jubilith.”</p>
<p>  Her smile faded slowly, her mouth drooped, her eyes
became moist. She looked off into the forest. “I’m— afraid,” she
said in a voice which lacked conviction. “Those soldiers who
escaped may be waiting in the forest. . . .”</p>
<p>  Glystra snorted. “They’re half-way to Montmarchy by
now—worse luck. Besides, you can almost see Jubilith from here,
straight up the slope. I’m sorry if you’re frightened. You can take
a catapult and darts if you like. . . .”</p>
<p>  She apparently realized the hopelessness of
argument, turned away without a word, crossed the clearing. At the
edge of the forest she paused, looked over her shoulder.</p>
<p>  Glystra watched silently.</p>
<p>  She turned away. He watched her a few moments,
moving through the trees. He saw her come out on the sunny bracken,
listlessly start up the slope toward Jubilith.</p>
<p>  Half an hour later the column got under way. The
Beaujolains walked single-file, each tied to the man ahead and
behind by ankle ropes. They carried their swords and catapults, but
the darts were packed in panniers, on one of the pack-beasts.</p>
<p>  The officer led the column; Abbigens was the last
man. Then came the pack-beasts, with Corbus on a litter between the
first two. He was awake and cheerful, and guarded the rear of the
column with the big heat-gun.</p>
<p>  The village overhead was awake, watching. As the
column passed through the forest, the thud of feet sounded along
the walkways, along with the creak of fiber fastenings, sometimes a
mutter of voices, a child crying. Presently a ceiling of tangled
and tattered vegetation, supported by a patchwork of branches,
vines and dried yellow fronds, cut off the sunlight. This second
floor to the forest spread to a surprising extent, dank on the
bottom, trailing bits and shreds of rotting vegetation.</p>
<p>  “What do you make of that?” asked Pianza.</p>
<p>  “Offhand,” responded Glystra, “it looks like a
hanging garden . . . We don’t have an ecologist with us any more.
Darrot probably would have known something about it. . .”</p>
<p>  Shafts of sunlight ahead indicated the end of the
suspended field. Glystra went to the head of the line, where the
officer walked, looked sullenly straight ahead.</p>
<p>  “What’s your name?” asked Glystra.</p>
<p>  “Morwatz. Leg-leader Zoriander Morwatz, 112th at the
Champs-Mars Academy.”</p>
<p>  “What were your orders?”</p>
<p>  The officer hesitated, debating the propriety of
answering the questions. He was a short man, with a full round
face, protuberant black eyes. He spoke in a slightly different
dialect than did his soldiers, and carried himself with a trace of
self-importance. Apparently he was a warrior by accident of caste
rather than inclination, essentially not a bad fellow, Glystra
decided. A man like Abbigens would completely overshadow him,
reduce him to vacillation and querulousness.</p>
<p>  “What were your orders?” repeated Glystra.</p>
<p>  “We were placed at the command of the Earthman.” He
jerked his hand back toward Abbigens. “He carried a cachet from
Charley Lyssider, an instrument of great authority.”</p>
<p>  Glystra digested the information a moment, then
asked, “An order addressed to you specifically?”</p>
<p>  “To the commanding officer of the Montmarchy
garrison.”</p>
<p>  “Hmmmm.” Where had Abbigens obtained this order,
signed by the Bajarnum of Beaujolais? There was a pattern here
which as yet he was unable to see in the whole. Certainly the fact
of Vallusser’s guilt did not explain all the events of the last few
weeks.</p>
<p>  He asked further questions, and learned that Morwatz
had been born into the Guerdons, a caste of lesser nobility, and
was foolishly proud of the distinction. His home was the village of
Pellisade, a few miles south of Grosgarth, and he believed Earth to
be the home of a mindless robot race, obeying the sound of gongs
and bells like machines. “We’d die here in Beaujolais, before we’d
let ourselves be emasculated,” declared Morwatz with fine fire.</p>
<p>  Here was the obverse, thought Glystra, to the
stereotype in Earth minds of the Big Planeter as a flamboyant,
reckless creature, totally without restraint. Grinning he asked,
“Do any of us look as if our powers of free will were lacking?”</p>
<p>  “You’re the elite. Here in Beaujolais we have a
single lord, Charley Lyssider; never such tyranny as you experience
on Earth. Oh, we’ve heard all about it, from people who know best.”
He nodded his plump head several times.</p>
<p>  Now he looked at Glystra sidelong. “Why do you
smile?”</p>
<p>  Glystra laughed. “<em>Naisuka</em>. The reason that
is no reason at all.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz said suspiciously, “You use an extremely
high-caste word. Even I would not feel proper speaking so.”</p>
<p>  “Well, well,” Glystra arched his eyebrows. “You are
not allowed to use certain words—but neither do you live under
tyranny.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz pursed his lips. “To be sure the Bajarnum is
a harsh man, but he is conquering the barbarians and forcing them
to live correctly.”</p>
<p>  “And they won’t be able to use high-caste words
either.”</p>
<p>  “Precisely. As it should be.” And now Morwatz
screwed up his courage to ask a question of his own. “And what will
you do with us?”</p>
<p>  “If you obey orders, you’ll have the same chances we
have. Frankly, I’m counting on you and your men to protect us on
our march. Once we arrive at our destination, your life is your
own.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz said with interest, “Where do you march
for?”</p>
<p>  “Earth Enclave.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz frowned. “I don’t know the place. How many
leagues?”</p>
<p>  “Forty thousand miles. Thirteen thousand
leagues.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz faltered in his stride. “You are mad!”</p>
<p>  Glystra laughed. “We have the same man to thank for
our troubles.” He jerked his thumb. “Abbigens.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz found it difficult to shape his thoughts.
“First there is Nomadland and the gypsies. If they capture us,
they’ll roast us alive and eat us. They are men of a different race
and they detest the Beaujolais.”</p>
<p>  “They won’t attack fifty men as readily as they
might eight.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz shook his head despondently. “Last six-moon
Heinzelman the Hellhorse raided deep into Beaujolais, and paved the
way with the utmost in terror.”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked ahead through the thinning
tree-trunks, to the open slope ahead. “There’s Nomadland, ahead of
us. What lies beyond?”</p>
<p>  “After Nomadland?” Morwatz wrinkled his brow.
“First, the River Oust. And then the swamps, and the Ropemakers of
Swamp Island. And after the swamps—”</p>
<p>  “What?”</p>
<p>  “Directly east, I don’t know. Wild men, wild
animals. Southerly is the land known as Felissima, and Kirstendale,
and the monoline to Myrtlesee Fountain and the oracle. Past
Myrtlesee is the Land of Stones, but of this I know nothing, since
Myrtlesee is far to the east.”</p>
<p>  “How many leagues?”</p>
<p>  “Several hundred. But it is hard to determine
exactly. From here to the river is—five days. To cross you must use
the Edelweiss high-line to Swamp Island, or else you must follow
the River Oust south-west back toward Beaujoiais.”</p>
<p>  “Why can’t we cross the river in boats?”</p>
<p>  Morwatz made a wise face. “The griamobots.”</p>
<p>  “And what are they?”</p>
<p>  “Savage river beasts. Horrible creatures.”</p>
<p>  “Hm. And after the river? What then? How long to
cross the swamps?”</p>
<p>  Morwatz calculated. “If you journey east, four days—
if you find a good swamp car. If you choose to bear southerly, you
may take the monoline which leads down past the March—the Hibernian
March, that is—to Kir-stendale. Possibly six days or a week to
Kirstendale. Then, if you’re able to leave—”</p>
<p>  “Why should we not leave Kirstendale?”</p>
<p>  “Some do,” said Morwatz with a sly wink. “Others
don’t . . . From Kirstendale the monoline runs west to Grosgarth,
south through the Felissima trade-towns, east to Myrtlesee
Fountain.”</p>
<p>  “How long to Myrtlesee from Kirstendale?”</p>
<p>  “Oh—” Morwatz made a vague gesture “—two days, three
days on the monoline. A dangerous trip otherwise, due to the
tribesmen down from Eyrie.”</p>
<p>  “And beyond Myrtlesee?”</p>
<p>  “Desert.”</p>
<p>  “And beyond?”</p>
<p>  Morwatz shrugged. “Ask the Magic Fountain. If you
are wealthy and pay much metal he will tell you anything you ask.”
He spoke with confidence.</p>
<p>  Glystra thought it might be well to inquire the best
way to convey himself and his comrades to Earth Enclave.</p>
<p>  Overhead the foliage thinned and the column broke
out into the blinding Big Planet sunlight. The slope fell away
ahead, a vast windy moor, rolling slightly concave before them. No
human habitation or artifact was in sight, but far to the north a
dense pillar of smoke bent eastward in the wind.</p>
<p>  Glystra halted the column, regrouped the soldiers,
arranging them in a square around the pack-beasts— zipangotes, so
Morwatz called them. The beast carrying the darts was guarded by
Corbus riding in a litter directly behind. He carried a catapult
and dart in his hand, with the heat gun tucked inside his shirt
secure from any swift clutch. Abbigens walked at the right forward
corner, Morwatz at the left rear. Flanking as guards to left and
right were Pianza and Cloyville with ion-shines; behind came Bishop
and Ketch.</p>
<p>  Two hours before noon they set forth across the
moor, and as they marched the tremendous slope behind them began to
lose its bulk. The upper reaches became murked in the haze, the
forest became a dark band. The slope was levelling out into the
River Oust pene-plain.</p>
<p>  A mutter from the soldiers reached his ears. They
were faltering in their step, the whites showed in their eyes.
There was a general nervous motion along the column, a jerking of
arms, a tossing of the grotesque black felt hats.</p>
<p>  Following their gaze Glystra saw along the horizon a
dozen tall hump-backed zipangotes, approaching at a careless
pace.</p>
<p>  “Who are they? Gypsies?”</p>
<p>  Morwatz scanned the column, his face set in rigid
lines. “They’re gypsies, but not the Cossacks. These are high-caste
warriors, possibly even Politburos. Only Politburos ride zipangoes.
We can fight off Cossacks, they have little spirit, no discipline,
no method, no mind. Only hunger. As soon as there are a few bodies,
no matter whose, they are content. But the Politburos ...” His
voice faltered, he shook his head.</p>
<p>  Glystra prompted him. “What are the Politburos?”</p>
<p>  “They are the great warriors, the leaders. When they
appear the gypsies fight like devils. The Cossacks alone are mere
robbers. When a Politburo leads them— demons!”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked at Bishop. “Know much about these
gypsies, Bish?”</p>
<p>  “There’s a short chapter in Vendome’s <em>Big Planet
Lore</em> on the gypsies, but the emphasis is on their racial
background rather than their culture. The stock was originally a
tribe of Kirghiz herdsmen from Earth. Turkestan, I believe. When
Cloud Control increased trans-Caucasian rainfall, they moved out to
Big Planet, where steppes presumably would remain steppes. They
shipped out third-class, and in the same hold were a tribe of
old-fashioned gypsies and a brotherhood of Polynesians. On the trip
out the gypsy leader, one Panvilsap, killed the Kirghiz head-man,
married the Polynesian matriarch, and when they were discharged on
Big Planet, controlled the entire group. The ensuing culture was
mingled Kirghiz, Polynesian and Romany, and dominated by the
personality of Panvilsap—an enormous man, a killer, a butcher, as
ruthless as he was single-minded.”</p>
<p>  The column was now less than a mile distant,
approaching without haste.</p>
<p>  Glystra turned to Morwatz. “How do these people
live?”</p>
<p>  “They herd zipangotes, hare-hounds, pechavies,
milk-rats. They gather fungus from the cycads in Depression. Spring
and autumn they raid into Beaujolais and Kerka-ten to the north,
Ramspur to the south. The Oust cuts them off from Felissima and the
Rebbirs of Eyrie. Ah,” sighed Morwatz, “what a grateful war that
would be, between the Rebbirs and the gypsies.”</p>
<p>  “Typical nomadic society,” inserted Bishop. “Not a
great deal different from the ancient Scythians.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz said fretfully, “Why are you so interested
in the mannerisms of the race? Tonight, they intend to eat us . .
.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Heinzelman the Hell-horse</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The sun was at zenith, and the coiled gray-green
vegetation of the steppe gave off a smoky aroma. As the column
approached, it was gradually joined by groups of Cossacks, who fell
in behind the slow-jogging zipangotes.</p>
<p>  Glystra asked Morwatz, “Is this their usual method
of attack?”</p>
<p>  Morwatz yanked at his black headgear. “They observe
no usual methods.”</p>
<p>  Glystra said, “Order your men to take five darts
apiece from the pack and stand ready for action.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz seemed to fill out, expand. His chest and
shoulders became rigid, his face tightened. He strode down the
front of the square, barking orders. The Beaujolains straightened,
formed harder ranks. In groups of five, they passed beside the pack
animal which carried the darts, marched back into ranks.</p>
<p>  Bishop said dubiously, “Aren’t you afraid that—” he
paused.</p>
<p>  “I’m afraid to act afraid,” said Glystra. “They’d be
off like jack-rabbits toward the forest. It’s a matter of morale.
We’ve got to act as if these gypsies were dirt under our feet.”</p>
<p>  “I guess you’re right—in theory.”</p>
<p>  The mounted column halted a hundred yards across the
moor, just out of catapult range. The beasts were heavier than
those in the pack train—sleek, seal-brown, soft-padded creatures,
with ridged convex backs, long heavy necks. They were decked in
trappings of shaggy leather painted with crude designs, and each
wore a white rhinoceros-like horn strapped to its snout.</p>
<p>  A tall burly man sat on the first of the zipangotes.
He wore blue satin trousers, a short black cloak, a peaked leather
cap with cusped ear-pieces protruding at either side. A three-inch
brass ring hung from each ear, and on each side of his chest he
wore a medal of polished iron. He had a round muscular heavy-lidded
face; his skin was maroon as if charged with a special strong
blood.</p>
<p>  Glystra heard Morwatz mutter, “Heinzelman the
Hell-horse!” And his voice was as flat as if he were reading the
hour of his own death.</p>
<p>  Glystra re-examined the man, noted his complete
ease, an indifferent confidence more striking than any arrogance.
Behind rode a dozen others similarly garbed, and still further
behind skulked a hundred men and woman in be-ribboned and
be-tasselled breeches of dull red, green or blue, heavy fustian
blouses, leather skull-caps, some of which were crested by
complicated white objects.</p>
<p>  Glystra turned to check the formation of the
Beaujolains—<em>thwinggg</em>! something sang past his throat like
a hornet. He recoiled, ducked, looked full in the flat face of
Abbigens, lowering his catapult with a curiously black
expression.</p>
<p>  “Morwatz,” said Glystra, “take the catapult from
Abbigens, tie his wrists together, hobble him.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz hesitated a fraction of an instant, then
turned, spoke to a pair of soldiers.</p>
<p>  There was a scuffle which Glystra ignored—for now
Heinzelman the Hell-horse and his Politburos had dismounted and
were approaching.</p>
<p>  Heinzelman halted a few paces distant, half-smiling,
toying with his quirt. “What is your thought encroaching on the
land of the gypsies?” His voice was soft and fluent.</p>
<p>  “We’re heading for Kirstendale, past the swamps,”
said Glystra. “The route crosses Nomadland.”</p>
<p>  Heinzelman drew back his lips, displaying teeth
marvellously inlaid with minute bits of colored stone. “You risk
your flesh, entering this land of hungry men.”</p>
<p>  “The risk is to the hungry men.”</p>
<p>  “From the soldiers?” Heinzelman made a contemptuous
gesture. “I will kill each and drink his blood.”</p>
<p>  Glystra heard a whimper, a cry. “Claude—Claude—”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Hot blood pulsed in his brain. He stood swaying,
then became conscious of Heinzelman’s amused scrutiny. “Who calls
my name?”</p>
<p>  Heinzelman looked negligently over his shoulder. “A
woman of the slopes we found by the forest this morning. She will
be spitted at this evening’s camp.”</p>
<p>  Glystra said, “Bring her forth, I will buy her from
you.”</p>
<p>  Heinzelman said lazily, “Then you have wealth? This
is a fortunate day for the gypsies.”</p>
<p>  Glystra tried to hold his voice steady. “Bring forth
this woman or I’ll send a man to take her.”</p>
<p>  “A man? One man?” Heinzelman’s eyes narrowed. “What
race of man are you? Not Beaujolain, and you are too dark for a
Maquir ...”</p>
<p>  Glystra casually brought forth his ion-shine. “I am
an electrician.” And grinned at his own joke.</p>
<p>  Heinzelman rubbed his heavy chin. “In what parts
live they?”</p>
<p>  “It’s not a race; it’s an occupation.”</p>
<p>  “Ah! There are none such among us; we pursue our own
business. We are warriors, killers, eaters. And if I gave you the
woman, tonight we should go hungry.”</p>
<p>  Glystra came to a grim decision. He turned his head.
“Bring out Abbigens.” To Heinzelman: “Electricians carry death in
their every gesture.”</p>
<p>  Abbigens had been thrust forward, and stood still as
a pillar, his pale mouth sagging.</p>
<p>  Glystra said, “If killing you did not serve a
practical purpose, I’d probably march you all the way to Earth
Enclave for de-aberration.” He raised the ion-shine. Abbigens’ face
was like risen dough. He began to laugh wildly. “What a joke! What
a joke on you, Glystra!” The violet ray snapped out, power crackled
down the conductive channel. Abbigens was dead.</p>
<p>  Heinzelman appeared faintly bored.</p>
<p>  “Give me the woman,” said Glystra, “or I’ll bring
this same death to you. I give you the corpse in her place.” He
used the push-button rasp of authority. “<em>Quick</em>!”</p>
<p>  Heinzelman looked up in faint surprise, hesitated,
then made a motion to his men. “Let him have her.”</p>
<p>  Nancy came limping forward, fell shaking and sobbing
at Glystra’s knees. He ignored her. “Take your meat,” he said to
Heinzelman. “Go your way and we go ours.”</p>
<p>  Heinzelman had regained whatever composure he had
lost. “I’ve seen those electrical clubs before. The Bajarnum of
Beaujolais brings them down from the sky. But they kill no more
certainly than our lances. Especially in the dark, when lances come
from many directions and the club points in only one.”</p>
<p>  Glystra turned to Morwatz. “Give the command to
march.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz stood back, jerked his arm up and down.
“Forward!”</p>
<p>  Heinzelman nodded, half-smiling. “Perhaps we shall
meet again.”</p>
<p>  The Great Slope was a shadow behind the western
haze; the steppe spread as wide as an ocean, carpeted with
blue-green bracken except where black-green furze filled the deeper
hollows. And behind were the gypsies, a dark clot like flies on
stale meat, the Cossacks squatting around the heavier mass of the
Politburos on their zipangotes.</p>
<p>  In late afternoon a dark shadow appeared in the
distance. “Looks like trees, probably an artesian pond,” said
Cloyville.</p>
<p>  Glystra looked around the horizon. “It seems to be
the only shelter in sight. We’d better camp for the night.” He
looked uneasily toward the dark specks in the rear. “I’m afraid
we’re in for more trouble.”</p>
<p>  The shadow took on substance, became a copse of a
dozen trees. Underneath was a carpet of blue-white moss and lush
herbage. A dozen gypsy women scuttled from the shadows, hulking
creatures in dirty black robes, to disappear over the lip of a
nearby swale. A moment later a flock of fragile white creatures
rose up on translucent wings and wheeled down-wind.</p>
<p>  At the center of the copse was a small pond bordered
by fat rust-colored reeds. A scattering of transparent bubbles,
like jellyfish, lay in the mud of the rim. Glystra looked in
suspicion at the water, which seemed brackish, but the Beaujolains
drank it with relish. Beside the pond was a tall rick full of
branches loaded with acorn-like fruit; beside the rick were tubs
full of rank beer and a crude still.</p>
<p>  The Beaujolains advanced eagerly to investigate the
still. Morwatz ran shouting to stop them; reluctantly they turned
back.</p>
<p>  Glystra took a small cup from one of the packs, gave
it to Morwatz. “Serve a measure to each of your men.”</p>
<p>  There was a whoop of approval and a keg was
broached. Glystra said to Pianza, “If we could serve them grog
every night we’d never need to guard them.”</p>
<p>  Pianza shook his head. “Just children. Very little
emotional control. I hope they don’t become boisterous.”</p>
<p>  “Liquor or not, we can’t relax. You and Cloyville
take the first four hours, Bishop, Ketch and I will take the next
four. Keep a sharp eye on the beast with the darts.” He went to
change the bandage on Corbus’ neck but found Nancy there before
him.</p>
<p>  The Beaujolains, singing now, built a fire, and
heaping on quantities of the branches from the rick, breathed in
the aromatic smoke. Pianza called to Glystra in a worried voice.
“They’re fighting drunk. I hope they don’t get any worse.”</p>
<p>  Glystra watched in growing apprehension. The
Beaujolains were pushing and shouting, trying to shoulder into the
densest clouds of smoke, where they stood with faces wreathed in
foolish smiles. When they themselves had been pushed aside,
immediately they raised angry outcries, cursed, pushed and elbowed
a way back into the smoke.</p>
<p>  “Must be a narcotic,” said Glystra. “Big Planet
marijuana. Got to put a stop to it.” He stepped forward.
“Morwatz!”</p>
<p>  Morwatz, red-eyed and flushed from his own
indulgence in the smoke, turned a reluctant face to the call. “Get
your men fed and bedded down; enough of the smoke breathing.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz made a slurred acquiescence, and turning on
his men, after a volley of curses, succeeded in bringing order to
the camp. A tureen of porridge was prepared— wheat flavored with
handfuls of dry meat and fungus.</p>
<p>  Glystra went to squat beside Morwatz, where he ate a
little apart from his troops. “What is that stuff?” He gestured
toward the rick.</p>
<p>  Morwatz looked a little sheepish. “It’s called
zygage— a very potent drug, very valuable.” He puffed himself up.
“Generally only the lowest castes inhale smoke—very vulgar, the
crudest sensations—”</p>
<p>  “How do you usually take it then?”</p>
<p>  Morwatz breathed heavily. “Normally I do not take it
at all. Far too expensive for a warrior. The Mercantils
occasionally brew a potion, but its use leads to debility, so I am
told. The soldiers will sleep well tonight, so you will observe.
Zygage saps much vitality; smoke, potion or nose-salve, the user
pays very dearly for his pleasure . . . But look you there, what
manner of drug does your man take?”</p>
<p>  Glystra turned his head. Bishop was swallowing his
customary handful of vitamins.</p>
<p>  Glystra grinned. “That’s a different kind of drug.
It has little effect—makes Bishop think he’s healthy. He’d never
know the difference if someone fed him chalk.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz was puzzled. “Another strange and useless
Earth custom.”</p>
<p>  Glystra rejoined his companions. Nancy had served
Corbus, then went to sit by herself among the zipangotes, as
inconspicuous as possible. Glystra had not spoken to her since she
had run to his feet from behind the Politburos.</p>
<p>  From the fire came a sudden tumult of hoarse
quarrelling. A soldier had quietly cast a new armful of the zygage
branches on the flames, and Morwatz had come forward expostulating.
The soldier, stumbling and red-eyed, cursed him back.</p>
<p>  Glystra sighed. “Now it’s discipline. Well—” he rose
to his feet “—I suppose we’ve got to make an example.”</p>
<p>  Morwatz was pulling the smoking branches from the
blaze; the soldier lurched up, kicked him. Morwatz fell face down
into the coals.</p>
<p>  Cloyville ran forward to pull at the screaming
Morwatz; three soldiers leapt on his back, pulled him down. Pianza
aimed the ion-shine, but held his fire for fear of shocking
Cloyville. Beaujolains came at him from all directions. He aimed,
fired: <em>Snap</em>—<em>snap</em>—<em>snap</em>. Three soldiers
fell flat, shrivelled flesh. The others swarmed over him.</p>
<p>  The clearing was suddenly alive with wild-eyed men,
screaming and savage. One sprang at Ketch, toppled him. Glystra
killed him with his ion-shine, then felt viciously strong arms
seize him from behind, hurl him to the ground.</p>
<p>  The Earthmen lay weaponless, arms lashed behind
their backs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Nearby Morwatz lay moaning from deep in his throat.
The soldier who had first kicked him came forward, a tall man with
concave cheeks, a pocked forehead, a split nose. He looked down,
and Morwatz regarded him with glazing eyes and moans gradually
ascending in pitch. The soldier deliberately drew his sword,
punctured Morwatz’ neck— once, twice, three times, as if he were
prodding a rock. Morwatz, gurgled, died. He turned, came to look at
his captives, tapped Glystra’s chin with the reeking sword. He
laughed. “Your death will not be at my hands. It’s back to
Grosgarth for you, and there’ll be a reward to set us up as
noblemen . . . Let Charley Lyssider have his will with you. . .
.”</p>
<p>  “The gypsies!” said Glystra in a choked voice.
”They’ll kill us all!“</p>
<p>  “Pah. Dirty animals!” He swung his sword in a wild
flourish. “We’ll kill them as they come!” He gave a great exultant
roar, a wordless drug-addled cry of pure abandon. Leaping to the
rick, he threw armful after armful of branches into the blaze. The
smoke poured forth, the Beaujolains inhaled it in tremendous
racking gulps. Breaking free to gasp for air, they fell to their
hands and knees, crawled back to suck up new lungfuls.</p>
<p>  Glystra tugged at his bonds, but they had been
well-tied, cinched up with no fegard for circulation. He craned his
neck. Where was Nancy? Nowhere in sight. Had she escaped? Where
could she escape to? Glystra ground his teeth. The gypsies would
take her and there would be no succor this time . . . Unless she
could slip back to the forest during the night. She had clearly
fled. The copse was too small to conceal her, and she was nowhere
within the range of vision. Twilight was drifting down from the
Great Slope—a warm achingly beautiful time of luminous violet air
with velvety black and gray shadows below . . . There was a distant
sound that he found himself listening to, a far chanting from the
steppe, a stave of four notes on a minor scale, punctuated by a
rumbling bellow as of a brass horn.</p>
<p>  The breeze shifted. Smoke from the smouldering
zygage drifted through the rapt soldiers to float across the bound
Earthmen. Twist, turn as they might, avoiding the smoke was
impossible. Pungent and sweet, it blossomed up through their
nostrils directly into their brains. For a moment they felt
nothing; then as one man they lay back, succumbing to the
irresistible power of the drug.</p>
<p>  The first sensation was double, triple vitality, a
thousandfold perceptiveness that saw, heard, felt, smelt with
minuscule and catholic exactness. Each leaf on the tree became an
identity, each pulse a singular and unique experience. Flitting
swarms of pleasant experiences crowded into the mind: triumphs of
love, zest of skiing, sailing, space-boating, diving; the joy of
colors, the freedom of clouds. At the same time another part of the
mind was furiously active; problems beame simplicities;
hardships—such as the bonds and the prospect of death at the hands
of Charley Lysidder—were details hardly worth attention. And off in
the distance the chanting waxed louder. Glystra heard it; surely
the Beaujolains must hear it likewise . . . But if they heard it
they heeded it not at all.</p>
<p>  The breeze shifted again; the smoke drifted away.
Glystra felt an instant resentment; he fought his bonds, looked
enviously to the Beaujolains standing quiet, quivering slightly in
the rapturous smoke.</p>
<p>  The chanting was loud, close at hand. The
Beaujolains at last heeded. They stumbled away from the fire, black
hats askew, eyes bulging, bloodshot, faces distended, mouths gaping
and gasping for air.</p>
<p>  The leader raised his head like a wolf,
screamed.</p>
<p>  The cry pleased the Beaujolains. Each one threw back
his head and echoed it. Scream after scream of furious challenge
rang out toward the gypsies. Now laughing, crying, they loaded
themselves with darts, ran out of the copse toward the gypsy
horde.</p>
<p>  The leader called out; the soldiers, without
halting, ordered themselves into a loose formation, and shrilling
the eager challenge, charged into the afterglow.</p>
<p>  The copse was quiet. Glystra rolled to his knees,
struggled to his feet, looked around for means to loosen his bonds.
Pianza called in a husky voice, “Stand still; I’ll see if I can
pull the ropes loose.” He rose to his own knees, raised to his
feet. He backed against Glystra’s hand, fumbled with the
thongs.</p>
<p>  He gasped in frustration. “My fingers are numb ... I
can’t move my hands . . .”</p>
<p>  The Beaujolains had crossed the twilight; now the
gypsy chanting came to a halt, and only the deep bellow of the horn
sounded. Detail was blurred in the evening; Glystra could see men
falling, then a convulsive Beaujolain charge which plunged into the
gypsies like a knife.</p>
<p>  The battle was lost in the dusk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>A Matter of Vitamins</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Glystra tried to break loose the knots on Pianza’s
wrists, without success. His fingers were like sausages, without
sensation. He was suddenly weak, lax; his brain felt inert. The
aftermath of the drug.</p>
<p>  The lid to the gypsy still quivered, raised.
Dripping, sodden, Nancy looked out—wide-eyed, white-faced.</p>
<p>  “<em>Nancy</em>!” cried Glystra. “Come here,
quick!”</p>
<p>  She looked at him as if dazed, moved uncertainly
forward, paused, looked out across the steppe toward the melee.</p>
<p>  The Beaujolain ululations rose shrill, keen,
triumphant.</p>
<p>  “Nancy!” cried Glystra. “Cut us loose—before they
come back and kill us!”</p>
<p>  Nancy looked at him with a strange contemplative
expression, as if lost in thought. Glystra felt hopelessly silent.
The drugged smoke or the fumes of the still had dulled her
reason,</p>
<p>  A throbbing chorus of bellows, deep-voiced, rich,
rang like bells across the air. There was an intermittent thudding
sound, and the Beaujolain yelling choked off, ceased. A voice rose
above all others: Heinzelman the Hell-horse. “I kill, I eat your
lives! ... I kill, kill, kill. . . .”</p>
<p>  “<em>Nancy</em>!” cried Glystra. “Come here? Untie
us! They’ll be here any minute. Don’t you want to live?”</p>
<p>  She sprang forward, took a knife from her sash, cut,
cut, cut. Earthmen stood about, rubbing their wrists, grimacing at
the pain of restored circulation, torpid with zygage hangover.</p>
<p>  Glystra muttered, “At least we need worry no further
about guarding the Beaujolains ... A load off our minds. ...”</p>
<p>  “The gypsies will eat well tonight,” said Bishop.
Alone in the group he appeared alert. Indeed, he was more than
alert; he evidently retained the mental edge and physical tone
which the others had felt under influence of the zygage. Glystra
wonderingly watched him prance up and down, like a boxer loosening
his muscles. His own frame felt like a sack of damp rags.</p>
<p>  Ketch bent with the effort of an old man, picked up
a shining piece of metal. “Somebody’s ion-shine.”</p>
<p>  Glystra searched the clearing, found his own weapon
where it had been carelessly flung. “Here’s mine . . . They were
too steamed up to care about anything.” The breeze brought a wisp
of smoke into his face; new fingers of delight searched into his
brain. “<em>Whew</em>! That stuff is powerful. ...”</p>
<p>  Bishop had flung himself to the turf and was doing
pushups. Feeling the stares of the others he jumped to his feet. “I
just feel good,” he said, grinning sheepishly. “That smoke did me
good.”</p>
<p>  There was silence from the steppes. Overhead in the
pale blue-black sky, stars flickered.</p>
<p>  The gypsy war-chant rose up, loud, close at hand.
Something whickered overhead, slashing through the leaves.</p>
<p>  “Down!” hissed Glystra. “Arrows . . . Move away from
the fire.”</p>
<p>  Loud came the chant: four notes on a querulous
quavering scale, sung with syllables that carried no meaning.</p>
<p>  Loud came Heinzelman’s voice. “Come forth, you
strange men, you miserable intruders, come forth. Come crouch at my
feet while I kill you, while I drink your blood; come forth ... I
am Heinzelman the Hell-horse, Heinzelman the life-eater, I eat your
life, I am the It, the Pain-maker, Heinzelman. . . .”</p>
<p>  They saw his shape silhouetted, and behind him were
a string of zipangotes. Glystra sighted along his ion-shine, then
hesitated. It was like felling an ancient tree. He called, “You’d
do better leaving us alone, Heinzelman.”</p>
<p>  “<em>Bah</em>!” A sound of immeasurable disdain.
“You dare not face me higher than your knees. Now I come to kill
you; put down your electrical tricks, bow your neck, I come to
kill.”</p>
<p>  Glystra numbly started to lay down the ion-shine,
then blinked, fought off the man’s magnetism. He pushed the button.
Purple sparks flashed at Heinzelman, buried into his chest,
absorbed, defeated. “He’s grounded!” thought Glystra in sudden
panic.</p>
<p>  Heinzelman loomed on the afterglow, a heroic figure,
larger than life . . . Bishop ran forward, closed with him.
Heinzelman bellowed, a ringing bull-sound. He bent, Bishop twisted,
rose up beneath. Heinzelman performed a majestic cartwheel, struck
earth with a ponderous jar. Bishop sat casually on him, made play
with his hands a moment, then stood up. Glystra approached, still
numb. “What did you do?”</p>
<p>  “Tried out a few judo tricks,” said Bishop modestly.
“I had an idea the fellow won his battles with his voice, his
hypnotic suggestion. Sure enough he was soft; no muscle around his
major chord. I killed him dead as a mackerel, one tap in the right
place.”</p>
<p>  “I never knew you were a judo expert.”</p>
<p>  “I’m not ... I read a book on the subject a few
years back, and it came to me all at once—my word, all those
zipangotes!”</p>
<p>  “They must have belonged to the other Politburos,
that the Beaujolains killed. They’re ours now.”</p>
<p>  “Where are the other gypsies?”</p>
<p>  Glystra listened. There was not a sound to be heard
across the steppes. A far bray of the horn? He could not be
sure.</p>
<p>  “They’ve gone. Melted away.”</p>
<p>  They returned to the copse leading the zipangotes.
Glystra said, “We’d better get going.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville stared. “Now?”</p>
<p>  “Now!” Glystra snapped. He was taut with weariness.
“Three Beaujolain soldiers got away last night. They’ll take the
news to Montmarchy. A new column will be sent out. They’ll be
mounted on zipangotes, they’ll carry metal weapons. We can’t take
chances. I don’t like it any more than you do but—” he pointed to
the zipangotes “—at least we can ride.”</p>
<p>  Morning, midday, afternoon—the Earthmen slumped on
the curved backs of the zipangotes, half-dazed with fatigue. The
gait was a smooth rocking pitch, not conducive to sleep. Evening
came with a slow dimming of the sky.</p>
<p>  A fire was built in a hollow, a pot of wheat
porridge boiled and eaten, two-hour sentry watches set, and the
column bedded down.</p>
<p>  Glystra was too tired to fall asleep. He twisted and
turned. He thought of Nancy, raised to his elbow. Her eyes were on
him. Sweating, he sank back into the couch. It would be hard
indulging what he felt to be a mutual passion without making
themselves ridiculous. It would also be inconsiderate . . .
Sighing, Glystra slumped back into his blankets.</p>
<p>  The next morning Glystra opened his eyes to observe
Bishop running lightly back and forth along the side of the slope.
Glystra rubbed his eyes, yawned, hauled himself to his feet.
Feeling dull and liverish he called irritably to Bishop, “What in
the world’s come over you? I never knew you to go in for early
morning exercise before.”</p>
<p>  A flush mounted Bishop’s long homely face. “I can’t
understand it myself. I just feel good. I’ve never felt so well in
my life. Perhaps my vitamins are taking hold.”</p>
<p>  “They never took hold before we got all doped up
with that zygage. Then they took hold like ice-tongs, and you ran
out and played hell with Heinzelman.”</p>
<p>  “I can’t understand it,” said Bishop, now
half-worried. “Do you think that drug has permanently affected
me?”</p>
<p>  Glystra rubbed his chin. “If it has it seems to be a
good thing—but why did it give the rest of us hangovers? We all ate
the same, drank the same . . . Except—” he eyed Bishop
speculatively. “I wish we had more of those branches; I’d make some
experiments.”</p>
<p>  “What kind of experiments?”</p>
<p>  “It occurred to me that you’d crammed yourself with
vitamins—just before the smoke hit us.”</p>
<p>  “Well, yes. That’s true. So I did. I wonder if
possibly there’s a connection . . . Interesting thought . . .”</p>
<p>  “If I ever lay my hands on any more of that zygage,”
muttered Glystra, watching Bishop absent-mindedly flexing his arms.
“I’ll find out for sure.”</p>
<p>  Four days of steady travel passed, from dawn till
sunset. They saw no human being until on the afternoon of the
fourth day they came upon a pair of young gypsy girls, perhaps
sixteen or seventeen years old, tending a score of sluggish
animals, yellow-furred, the size of sheep— pechavies. They wore
tattered gray smocks and their feet were tied in rags. The
freshness of youth was still theirs, and they had a wild prettiness
in no way diminished by their complete fearlessness when they found
that the men of the column were not gypsies.</p>
<p>  They deserted their animals and ran forward. “Are
you slavers,” asked the first happily. “We wish to be slaves.”</p>
<p>  “Sorry,” said Glystra dryly. “We’re just travellers.
Why are you so anxious?”</p>
<p>  The girls giggled, eyeing Glystra as if his question
were obtuse. “Slaves are fed often and eat from dishes. Slaves may
step under a roof when the rain comes, and I’ve heard it said that
slaves are eaten only if no other food is available . . . We are to
be eaten this winter, unless the pechavies fatten past
expectation.”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked at them irresolutely. If he set about
righting the wrongs of everyone they meet, they would never arrive
at Earth Enclave. On the other hand—a stealthy thought—if the other
men in the column were provided with women, it would be possible
for him to advance his own desires. Of course, camp-followers would
slow up the column. There would be added supply problems, emotional
flare-ups . . . He looked over his shoulder. Corbus caught his eyes
as if divining his thoughts.</p>
<p>  “I could use a good slave” he said easily.
“You—what’s your name?”</p>
<p>  “I’m Motta. She’s Wailie.”</p>
<p>  Glystra said weakly, “Anyone else?”</p>
<p>  Pianza shook his head. “I’m much too old. Too
old.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville snorted, turned away.</p>
<p>  This was embarrassing thought Glystra. Here is where
he should display firmness, leadership . . . He passed over Ketch,
who gloried in his misogyny, and would suffer the pangs of Saint
Anthony before yielding so eaily.</p>
<p>  Bishop said tentatively, “I’ll take her.”</p>
<p>  Glystra felt quick relief, vindication of a sort.
And the problems of the future could be met as they arose. Now was
the present, now was the time containing that sweet union of
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, spirit, will and imagination named Nancy.
He met her eyes, as if there had been a signal. She colored
faintly, gave an enigmatic jerk of the shoulder, looked away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Three more days of riding the steppe, each exactly
alike. On the fourth day the land changed. The bracken grew taller
and harder to ride through, almost like Earthly manzanita. There
were occasional flamboyant shrubs six feet tall, with leaves like
peacock fans. Ahead appeared a low black blur, which the gypsy
girls identified as the bank of the River Oust.</p>
<p>  At noon they came upon a fetish post driven into the
earth—a round timber eight feet tall, topped by a spherical gourd
painted to represent a face.</p>
<p>  The gypsy girls made a wide circuit of the post.
Wailie said in a hushed voice, “The Magickers of Edelweiss put that
there, and only just now, to warn us away from the river.”</p>
<p>  Bishop patiently pointed out that in all the range
of vision there was no living creature but themselves.</p>
<p>  “Only just now,” declared Wailie stubbornly. “See
the moist dirt.”</p>
<p>  “Does look fresh,” Bishop admitted dubiously.</p>
<p>  “If you touch the post, you will blacken and die,”
cried Motta.</p>
<p>  Glystra, reflecting that many folk-beliefs were
based on fact, searched the steppe in all directions . . . There! A
flicker of white? Whatever it was, it disappeared over a distant
swale.</p>
<p>  In the middle afternoon they came upon Edelweiss, a
stockaded fort, with three story blockhouses at each corner.</p>
<p>  Motta explained. “Sometimes the South Cossacks raid
the Magickers. They are not allowed at the Rummage Sale, because
the sight of naked knees drives them mad and they run
killing-crazy. But they love the gray powder salt which comes up
the river from Gammerei and the Magickers have it in stock, and
that is why Edelweiss is girt up with such care.”</p>
<p>  The town was illumined full-face by the afternoon
sun, and across the clear distance appeared as a toy, a miniature,
colored dark and light brown, with black windows, light green and
black roofs. From the center of town rose a tall pole, with a
cupola at the top, like the crow’s-nest of a ship.</p>
<p>  Motta explained the purpose of the pole. “The
high-wire to Swamp Island is made fast at the top of the pole. And
then the Magickers always watch the distance; they read the clouds
as signs, and the wise hags among them see the future.”</p>
<p>  “By watching clouds?”</p>
<p>  “So it is said. But we know little, being females
and raised for use.”</p>
<p>  They continued to the river, and with the afternoon
sun at their backs stood looking over the tremendous Oust. It
flowed from the far north, appearing into sight out of the hazy
distance, and proceeded into the equally distant south, curving
back toward the west. Cat’s-paws vibrated the surface, and at
intervals came a roiling-up from below, as if a monster fin had set
the water into turbulent motion. The other shore, two or three
miles distant, was low and flat, and overgrown with a dense forest
of tall poles two hundred feet tall. These were silvery-green and
stood like stripped and dead tree-trunks or gigantic asparagus
shoots. A few blots of color showed at their base— vermilion, blue,
yellow—too far distant to be resolved into detail. A long island
overgrown with feathery foliage split the center of the river like
a wedge.</p>
<p>  “Look!” Cloyville cried hoarsely—unnecessarily, for
every eye was straining fascinated. Floating from behind the island
came a black monster. Its body was round and sleek, its head was
like a frog, split by a vast mouth. The head darted forward as they
watched, chewed and champed at something in the water, then lowered
lazily, lay flat. The creature circled, drifted out of sight behind
the island.</p>
<p>  Cloyville released his breath. “<em>Whew</em>!
That’s a devilish thing to have for a neighbor.”</p>
<p>  Pianza searched the face of the river with concern.
“I wonder that anyone dares to cross. ...”</p>
<p>  Corbus pointed. “They use the high-line.”</p>
<p>  It was a thin gray-white cable, swooping from the
pole in the village to one of the spines of the forest on the
opposite shore. The low point at the center was only fifty feet
above the surface of the river.</p>
<p>  Glystra snorted in disgust. “They’ve got the
river-crossing sewed up, and so ... I suppose we’d better apply for
transportation.”</p>
<p>  “That’s how the Magickers acquire their wealth,”
said Motta.</p>
<p>  Cloyville muttered, “They’ll probably make us pay
through the nose. ...”</p>
<p>  Glystra rubbed his short black thatch. “It’s a case
of take it or leave it. We’ve got to take it if it breaks us.” He
looked back across the steppe. “I don’t see the Beaujo-lain’s
flying squad. No doubt it’s there . . . Once we get past the river
we can breathe easier. ...”</p>
<p>  They set out along the lip of the bluff toward the
village.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Above them towered the walls of Edelweiss, two foot
timbers, peeled, set into the ground like piles, lashed at the top
with coarse fiber and evidently fastened elsewhere with dowels or
tree-nails. The wood appeared punky and soft. Glystra thought that
anyone determined on entry could easily chop his way in with a
hatchet.</p>
<p>  They stopped by the gate, which opened at the rear
of a rectangular alcove, well buttressed with extra courses of
timber. The gate was open, revealing a short passage walled on
either side and cut off at the far end by another wall.</p>
<p>  “Strange,” said Glystra. “No guards, no gate-keeper
... In fact—there’s no one.”</p>
<p>  “They’re afraid,” said Wailie. She raised her
strident young voice. “Magickers! Come out and lead us to the
high-line!”</p>
<p>  There was no overt response. A stealthy rustle
sounded behind the walls.</p>
<p>  “Come out,” yelled Motta, “or we’ll burn the
walls!”</p>
<p>  “My God!” muttered Pianza. Bishop wore an agonized
expression.</p>
<p>  Wailie sought to outdo her companion. “Come out and
give us welcome—or it’s the sword for all within!”</p>
<p>  Bishop clapped his hand over her mouth. “Are you
crazy?”</p>
<p>  Motta shrieked, “We’ll kill the Magickers and burn
the Hags, and slide the town into the river!”</p>
<p>  There was no motion in the passageway. Three old
men, bald, feeble, came forward. Their bare feet were blue-veined
and bony, they wore only ragged G-strings, the ribs showed like
corrugations down their milk-colored bodies.</p>
<p>  “Who are you?” quavered the first. “Go your ways,
disturb us not; we have nothing of value.”</p>
<p>  “We want to cross the river,” said Glystra. “Take us
across on the high-line and we won’t disturb you any further.”</p>
<p>  The old men engaged in a wheezing colloquy, watching
Glystra suspiciously as they whispered. Then: “It is too late in
the year. You must wait.”</p>
<p>  “Wait!” demanded Glystra indignantly. “Out
here?”</p>
<p>  The eyes of the old men faltered, fell. A muffled
voice came from behind the wall. The spokesman cocked his head,
listened, then said in a plaintive voice, “We are the quiet
Magickers, innocent sorcerers and trades-people. You are men of the
Savage Lands, and doubtless you come to loot our valuables.”</p>
<p>  “The eight of us? Nonsense. We want to cross the
river.”</p>
<p>  There were further instructions from within the
wall. The old man said in a quavering voice. “It is
impossible.”</p>
<p>  Glystra lowered his head ominously. “Why?”</p>
<p>  “It is forbidden.” The old men withdrew. The gate
slammed.</p>
<p>  Glystra chewed his lip in frustration. “Why in the
devil—”</p>
<p>  Corbus pointed to the tower. “There’s a heliograph
up there. It’s been shooting signals west. My guess is that they’ve
had orders from the Beaujolains.”</p>
<p>  Glystra grunted. “In that case, it’s more urgent
than ever to get across. Here we’re trapped.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville advanced to the bank, peered over. “No
boats in sight.”</p>
<p>  “Not even materials to make a raft,” said
Pianza.</p>
<p>  “A raft wouldn’t help us,” Cloyville pointed out.
“There’s no way to propel it, no sails, no sweeps.”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked up at the walls of Edelweiss. Corbus
grinned. “Are you thinking the thoughts I’m thinking?”</p>
<p>  “I’m thinking that a piece of that wall—the section
running parallel to the river, right there, would make a fine
raft.”</p>
<p>  “But how would we cross the river?” demanded
Cloyville. “There’s a good current out there; we’d be swept all the
way down to Marwan Gulf.”</p>
<p>  “There’s a way staring you in the face.” Glystra
made a lasso out of a length of pack-rope. “I’m going to climb the
wall; you cover me from below.”</p>
<p>  He tossed the loop around a timber, hauled himself
up, cautiously peered over the top, scrambled over.</p>
<p>  He looked down. “There’s no one up here. It’s a kind
of roof. One of you come up—Corbus.”</p>
<p>  Corbus joined him. Behind were blank walls and
shielded windows, all silent. Glystra looked skeptically at the
windows. “I suppose they’re watching, but afraid to show
themselves.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>The Griamobot</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  There was a sound behind them; Ketch hauled himself
over the wall. “Thought I’d see what the place looked like.” He
looked over the flat roofs. “Pretty dingy.”</p>
<p>  “Notice the wall,” said Glystra. “It’s lashed along
the top with rope, secured along the middle by dowels. If we cut
the rope, break the dowels—there, there, there—” he pointed up a
vertical crack where the dowels showed through— “and if a man were
to shove at each corner, I think we could drop the wall right over
into the river.”</p>
<p>  “How about those sea-serpents—the griamobots?” Ketch
asked.</p>
<p>  “They’re an unknown quantity. We’ll have to take a
chance.”</p>
<p>  “They might come up under the raft.”</p>
<p>  Glystra nodded. “It’s a chance. Would you rather
stay here?”</p>
<p>  “No.”</p>
<p>  Corbus stretched out his long arms. “Let’s get
busy.”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked at the sky. “An hour of light. Enough
to get us across, if things go well. Ketch, you go back down, take
the whole party, zipangotes and all, down to the beach under the
bluff. Naturally, keep clear when things start coming. We’ll send
the wall down; if it lands in the river, make it fast to the shore,
so it won’t float away.”</p>
<p>  Ketch swung himself back down to the ground.</p>
<p>  Glystra turned back to the wall. “We’ve got to get
this over before they figure out what we’re up to.” He looked over
the side. Twenty feet below was the edge of the bluff, then another
fifty feet, almost straight down, to the beach.</p>
<p>  “There won’t be any toe-hold to the wall. It should
go over almost of its own weight.”</p>
<p>  “Fifty feet of it ought to be enough,” said Corbus.
“The wood is light stuff.”</p>
<p>  “It’s not how much we need, it’s how much we can
get. I don’t think they’ll stand still when we get to work.”</p>
<p>  Along the beach below they saw the string of
zipan-gotes, with Ketch, Pianza, Bishop, Cloyville and the three
girls.</p>
<p>  Glystra nodded to Corbus, drew his knife, slashed at
the fiber rope binding the top of the wall. A sudden outraged
screeching came from behind. Apparently from nowhere appeared four
old women, white creatures with straggling pink-gray hair, howling
and gesticulating. A number of Magicker men, lean, white-skinned,
daubed around their shoulders with green paint, appeared behind
them.</p>
<p>  The coarse rope parted. “Now,” said Glystra. He
aimed his ion-shine, squeezed the button. Once—twice—three times.
Three holes down the vertical crack took the place of the pegs.
Setting their shoulders to the top of the posts, they pushed out.
The wall leaned, creaked, moved no further.</p>
<p>  “Below,” panted Glystra. “There’s more lashings
halfway down.” He crouched, peered into the dimness under the roof.
“We’ll have to shoot blind . . . You break your side, I’ll do
mine.”</p>
<p>  Two shafts of pale purple light, crackling power. A
tongue of fire licked up the punky side of the timbers, died in a
charred smoulder.</p>
<p>  The wall sagged, creaked. “Now,” panted Glystra,
“before they get their army up here . . . Don’t go over with
it!”</p>
<p>  The wall lurched, swept grandly out, fell, landed
top-down on the beach, stood a second, sagged outward, slapped into
the river with a smash of foam.</p>
<p>  Glystra caught a glimpse of Ketch scrambling out
with a bit of line, then turned to meet the onrush of a line of the
Magickers—gaunt men, naked except for the G-string at their loins.
They chattered furiously, but danced back like nervous
prize-fighters when they met his eye.</p>
<p>  The women screeched, bawled, bellowed, wailed, but
the men only made tentative movements forward. Glystra threw a
glance down to the river. The wall—now a raft— floated free,
pulling at the rope Ketch had made fast. Cloyville and Pianza stood
on the shore looking up. Glystra yelled down, “Lead the animals
aboard, tie them in the middle.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Bishop called up something Glystra did not catch; he
had been distracted by the scene in the room immediately below the
roof where he stood, a room now open to the air where the wall had
fallen away. Glystra’s throat contracted, his stomach twitched . .
. Twenty children hung by their hair two feet off the ground. Stone
weights were suspended from their feet. Wide-eyed, silent, the
children stared from bulging eyes into the new openness, silent
except for a hoarse breathing.</p>
<p>  “Making tall ones out of short ones,” came Corbus’
cool voice.</p>
<p>  “Look farther down,” said Glystra in a low voice.
“In the room next lower.”</p>
<p>  Corbus threw a glance toward the prancing Magickers,
peered down under the roof. “Can’t see too well . .. It’s confused
. . . Oh—”</p>
<p>  Glystra turned away. The Magickers were stealthily
sliding closer. “Get back! Back!” he said flatly. “Or I’ll cut your
legs out from under you.” In a lower voice he said, “I guess it
wouldn’t make any difference to you if you’ve all gone
through—that. ...”</p>
<p>  But his words were not heard, or if heard, not
heeded. Goaded by the frenzied calls of the old women, the
Magickers, lips drawn back from their long teeth, were prancing
forward, a step at a time. One began to scream—a quavering fierce
screech—which the entire line picked up. Suddenly they all were
brandishing four-foot pikes tipped with black horny barbs.</p>
<p>  “Looks like we’ll have to kill a few,” said Glystra
between tight lips, “unless they’ll scare . . .” He aimed the
ion-shine at the roof, blasted a hole in the roof at the feet of
the nearest Magicker.</p>
<p>  The Magicker never shifted his gaze. His eyes had
become fixed, saliva bubbled at his mouth.</p>
<p>  “They’re crazy—hysterics,” muttered Glystra. “Poor
devils, I don’t like it. . . .”</p>
<p>  Step by step the Magickers advanced, jerkily, one
motion at a time. Behind came the hoarse shrieks of the Hags, and
behind—the far glory of Big Planet sunset. Orange, flaring
gold.</p>
<p>  Too close. Suddenly desperate, Glystra called in a
deadly voice, “Two steps more, I’ll kill the lot of you. . . .”</p>
<p>  One step—two steps—pikes raised in gangling
arms.</p>
<p>  Glystra squeezed the button. Gaunt forms flapped on
the roof.</p>
<p>  Hags screamed horror, leapt across the roof to the
stairs, black warlock silhouettes, with tatters of cloth flying
behind.</p>
<p>  Glystra went to the edge, looked over. He yelled
down, “Get a line ready, and make it fast to what’s coming down
next.”</p>
<p>  Corbus was looking up the pole. “We’d better drop
the whole works, pole and all. Otherwise the cable will snap past
so fast they won’t be able to see it. Notice—three of those
guy-lines run to the top, three to the buckle-point at the middle.
If we cut off the three at top, the pole should snap off nice and
neat.”</p>
<p>  Glystra examined the magazine of his ion-shine,
squinting in the failing light. “Got to go easy on the power.
There’s not too much soup in this one.” He aimed, squeezed the
button.</p>
<p>  Three gray cables sang, fell twisting like snakes
over the roofs of Edelweiss. The pole snapped like a carrot. From
the cupola came wild shrieks of fright. “God!” said Glystra. “I’d
forgotten all about them. . . .”</p>
<p>  The pole crashed almost at their feet; the crying
stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>  Corbus called over the side, “Here it comes . . .
Heads up!”</p>
<p>  The tension of the cable dragged the stub across the
roof, over the edge of the bluff.</p>
<p>  “Lay hold of it!” Glystra yelled. “Make it fast to
the raft!” He started to scramble down the wall, past the strung-up
children, past the first floor, where he would not look. Corbus was
at his heels. They ran along the bluff, found a place to scramble
down to the beach.</p>
<p>  “Hurry,” yelled Pianza. “Our shore line can’t take
all the strain; it’ll go in a minute.”</p>
<p>  Glystra and Corbus waded out into the river,
scrambled up on to the cool soft timbers. “Let ’er go.”</p>
<p>  The raft drifted free. Behind them the bluff made a
black smear across the afterglow, and perched high was Edelweiss,
bereft and forlorn with the stump of its broken pole. “Poor
devils,” said Glystra.</p>
<p>  The raft floated out on the river, carried
downstream by the current but tethered to the opposite shore by the
cable of the broken high-line.</p>
<p>  “Ah,” sighed Cloyville, dropping his heavy posterior
to the logs. “Peace—quiet—it’s wonderful!”</p>
<p>  “Wait till you get to the other side before you
rejoice,” said Ketch. “There’s still the griamobots.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville rose swiftly to his feet. “I’d forgotten
about them. My Lord! Where are they? . . . If it’s not one thing
it’s another. . . .”</p>
<p>  Glystra pointed across the glimmering water to the
island—a feathery pyramid sharp on the mauve sky to the southeast.
“We won’t miss that island far—if at all. And there’s not a damn
thing we can do about it!”</p>
<p>  “Look,” said Bishop in a soft voice. Heads turned as
if activated by cams, eyes went to the object inching over the edge
of the raft—a flat glistening thing, solid and muscular. It
quivered, jerked up on the raft another six inches, becoming round
in cross-section.</p>
<p>  Another six inches . . . Pianza laughed. Bishop
moved forward. “I thought it was the end of a tentacle.”</p>
<p>  “It’s a big fluke—some sort of leech or sucker.”</p>
<p>  “Disgusting thing.” Bishop kicked it back into the
river.</p>
<p>  The raft gave a sudden lurch, swerved, twisted.
Domes of water boiled up around them.</p>
<p>  “Something below,” whispered Glystra.</p>
<p>  Motta and Wailie began to whimper.</p>
<p>  “Quiet!” snapped Glystra. They stifled the sound to
a thin whining in their throats.</p>
<p>  The motion ceased; the water subsided.</p>
<p>  Bishop touched Glystra’s arm. “Look up on the
Edelweiss cliff.”</p>
<p>  A torch had appeared. It shone, went out, shone,
went out—time and time again for varying intervals.</p>
<p>  “Code. They’re talking to someone. Probably across
the river to Swamp Island. Hope no one cuts the cable at that
end.”</p>
<p>  “Cloyville could swim ashore with a message,”
suggested Corbus. Cloyville snorted indignantly, and Corbus
chuckled.</p>
<p>  From behind the island came the griamobot, its head
high, questing. The dark concealed its features; evident only were
big segmented eyes. Water swished and gurgled past the black hulk
of its body, from which came a visceral growling sound.</p>
<p>  The head wove, swayed back and forth, suddenly
darted forward.</p>
<p>  “It sees us,” muttered Glystra. He drew his
ion-shine. “Perhaps I can damage it or scare it away . . . There’s
not enough power here for real effect if the brute is determined.
...”</p>
<p>  “Knock the head off,” said Pianza tremulously. “Then
it won’t be able to see us.”</p>
<p>  Glystra nodded. The violet beam touched the head. It
snapped off like a kicked paper bag. But the neck continued to
weave, back, forth, back, forth, and the beast never slowed or
changed direction.</p>
<p>  Glystra aimed at the body, fired. There was a thin
ripping sound and a black ragged hole appeared on the dark hide.
White objects like viscera seemed to boil up.</p>
<p>  Glystra stared, fired again, at the water line. The
monster cried out—in a babble of human voices.</p>
<p>  The hulk wabbled, wallowed; long white shapes poured
out through the hole.</p>
<p>  “Duck!” cried Glystra. “They’re throwing at us!”</p>
<p>  <em>Thud</em>! A pike plunged quivering into the
wood beside him. Another—another—then a sound unlike the others: a
shock and a long throaty gasp.</p>
<p>  Glystra raised up. “<em>Ketch</em>!”</p>
<p>  Ketch tore feebly at the shaft in his chest, fell
forward on his knees, inched yet further forward, bowed his head,
with the shaft grasped between his hands, and in this position he
froze quiet.</p>
<p>  “They’re boarding us!” yelled Cloyville.</p>
<p>  “Stand aside!” cried Pianza. He elbowed past
Cloyville. Lavish plumes of orange flame issued from the heat-gun,
wreathed the thin shapes, who threw up their arms, fell backward
into the river.</p>
<p>  The griamobot hulk had settled low in the water,
drifted down-current, past the raft and away.</p>
<p>  Glystra gently lay Ketch on his side. His hands were
locked on the shaft.</p>
<p>  Glystra stood up, looked across the dusk toward Town
Edelweiss; then after a moment, turned back to Ketch.
“Cloyville—help me.”</p>
<p>  He lay hold of Ketch’s lax ankles. Cloyville bent,
took the shoulders, hesitated. “What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>  “Drop him in the river. I’m sorry. We can’t afford
emotion.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville opened his mouth, stuttered, stammered.
Glystra waited.</p>
<p>  Cloyville finally said in a subdued voice, “Don’t
you think we should—well, give him a burial? A decent burial?”</p>
<p>  “Where? In the swamp?”</p>
<p>  Cloyville bent to the body.</p>
<p>  Ketch was gone.</p>
<p>  Glystra stood looking up at Town Edelweiss. “The
griamobot was a hoax. A commercial enterprise, to frighten people
off the river, to funnel them through the Edelweiss high-line. . .
.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Night lay heavy over Big Planet, and the shores were
dark. There was silence aboard the raft. Little black waves lapped
at the timbers. Down-stream they floated, borne by the current;
cross-stream, pulled by the tether of the one-time high-line.</p>
<p>  The spines of Swamp Island towered above them. The
chirping and rasping of myriad small insects came to their ears. No
lights were visible.</p>
<p>  The raft bumped gently into a ledge of mud,
halted.</p>
<p>  “We’ll have to wait for light,” said Glystra. “Let’s
try to get some sleep ...”</p>
<p>  But all sat staring across the black water, feeling
the loss of dour Ketch as a tongue feels the gap left by a drawn
tooth.</p>
<p>  The River Oust moved quietly past in the dark, and
somewhere now to the south was Ketch.</p>
<p>  Dawn came to the water, seeping in from nowhere,
moth-colored, the softest luminosity conceivable. First the forest
was black and the water black and the sky only less black, then the
sky was charged with dimness and the river shone like oil; and then
the mother-of-pearl light spread from sky to the air to the river,
where it reflected back in odd-shaped leaden plats and planes.</p>
<p>  There was more air and water and sky than a man’s
awareness could encompass. The river’s far shore was a low black
mark and Town Edelweiss a nubbin on the bluff. The air was still,
held in an immense cool quiet, smelling of mud and water and a
smoke, spice, early-morning scent, which in all the universe was
individual to the one spot here on the shore of the River Oust on
Big Planet.</p>
<p>  To the east the sky flared orange, yellow, behind
the black spines of the Swamp Island forest. They were two hundred
feet tall, crowding till in some instances the trunks touched.</p>
<p>  Motta screamed, a mindless piping. Glystra swung
around; his heart expanded, his blood caked. A tremendous black
body blotted out the river, overhead swung a barrel-size head,
split by a bony mouth. The head swung down, the eyes stared, the
neck looped, the head plunged into the water, returned laden with
sodden yellow fiber. It gulped, belched, sank out of sight into the
river.</p>
<p>  Life returned to the raft. Hysterical women. . .
.</p>
<p>  Calmness was restored. Glystra released a great pent
sigh. “Evidently the griamobots exist.”</p>
<p>  “I will vouch for it at any time,” declared
Cloyville.</p>
<p>  “But—they’re vegetarians. The Magickers arranged
that they should be thought carnivorous, and that was all that was
necessary to confine river traffic to the high-line . . . Well,
let’s get moving.”</p>
<p>  The raft floated flat and vacant on the river. The
zipangotes stood loaded and ready on the spongy black humus, raised
their feet up and down, swinging their long necks close to the
ground.</p>
<p>  Glystra walked a little way into the swamp, testing
the footing. The round boles, ash-gray overlaid with green luster,
prevented a clear vision of more than a hundred feet, but so far as
Glystra could see, the ground was uniformly black peat, patched
with shallow water. If sight was occluded horizontally, vertically
it was wide open; indeed, the upward lines of the trees impelled
the eyes to lift along the multitudinous perspectives, up to the
little blot of sky above. Walking gingerly across the black bog,
Glystra felt as if he were two hundred feet under water, an
illusion heightened by the flying creatures, which moved along the
vertical aisles with the ease of fish. Glystra saw two varieties: a
long electric-green tape with filmy green wings along its body,
rippling through the air like an eel, and little puffs of foam
drifting with no apparent organs of locomotion.</p>
<p>  Glystra returned to the river. The zipangotes had
been arranged in line, each long dog-like head under the
hindquarters of the beast ahead. “Let’s go,” said Glystra.</p>
<p>  The river fell behind, was quickly lost to sight.
The caravan wound like a snake in tall grass—now left, now right,
twisting, side-stepping, detouring the puddles of water.</p>
<p>  The sun rose, and they rode through shafts and bars
of heavy light, and zebra striping lay along the tall spines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>The Monoline</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  About noon, there was a sudden opening before them—a
lake. Small waves rippled and glinted at their feet; clouds
reflected between areas of deep blue. In the distance floated a few
low boats with wide double-lateen booms and baggy orange sails; and
beyond was Swamp City. It sat up in the air, on top of the forest,
like a mirage; it reminded Glystra of an old-world fishing
village.</p>
<p>  For several moments the party stood staring at the
city on stilts ... A shrill squawking startled them: a blue and
yellow flying thing, beating sluggishly through the air.</p>
<p>  “For a moment,” said Cloyville, “I thought the
Magick-ers were upon us.”</p>
<p>  Back to the forest—more winding, squeezing, doubling
back, occasionally a straight run of twenty or thirty feet.</p>
<p>  The sun moved across the sky; at last, in the middle
afternoon, Glystra saw overhead the walls and houses of the city.
Five minutes later the caravan moved into the shadow of the
deck.</p>
<p>  “A moment, please” said an unhurried voice. A
platoon of warriors stood beside them, stocky men in mulberry
coats.</p>
<p>  The officer approached Glystra. “Your business, if
you please.”</p>
<p>  “No business. We’re travellers.”</p>
<p>  “Travellers?” The officer glanced at the zipangotes.
“From where?”</p>
<p>  “From Jubilith, north of Beaujolais.”</p>
<p>  “How did you get those beasts across the river?
Certainly not on the high-line; our agent would have reported
you.”</p>
<p>  “We ferried them over on a raft. Last night.”</p>
<p>  The officer fingered his mustache. “Did not the
griamobots—”</p>
<p>  Glystra smiled. “The Magickers have been hoaxing
you. The griamobots are vegetarians, harmless. The only dangerous
griamobot was one the Magickers built and filled with
soldiers.”</p>
<p>  The officer swore under his breath. “Lord
Wittelhatch will wish to hear this. Magicker regulations and
tariffs have long irked him, especially since he strung up the
cable to begin with.”</p>
<p>  “The cable interests me,” said Glystra. “Is it
metal?”</p>
<p>  “Oh no, by no means.” The officer laughed affably—a
handsome young man with an expressive face and a jaunty
straw-colored mustache. “Come, I’ll lead you to where your caravan
may rest, and along the way you’ll see the working of our industry.
We are rope-makers to the world; nowhere is cable equal to
ours.”</p>
<p>  Glystra hesitated. “Our wish was to continue as far
along the way as possible before nightfall. Perhaps you will direct
us—”</p>
<p>  “A wealthy man in a hurry,” said the officer,
thoughtfully eying the three girls, “would ride the monoline. It
would cost much metal, much metal . . . Best confer with
Wittelhatch.”</p>
<p>  “Very well.” Glystra motioned to the column; they
followed the officer, and a moment later came upon a scene of
industry.</p>
<p>  A series of rope-walks occupied an area five hundred
feet square, which had been partially cleared, leaving only enough
spines to support the weight of the city above. Each rope-walk
consisted of a series of frames. In the process of formation the
rope passed through a hole in the frame and immediately afterward
passed through a wheel, which rotated around the rope as an axis.
Fixed at regular intervals on the wheel were five fat slugs, and
from their positors white strands ran to the rope. As the rope
pulled through the frame, the wheel rotated and five new strands
were added to the rope.</p>
<p>  Glystra sighted up the rope-walk. Each frame had its
wheel, and each wheel carried five slugs secreting thread for the
rope. “Very clever,” said Glystra. “Very clever indeed.”</p>
<p>  “Our rope is unexcelled,” said the officer, with a
proud twist for his mustache. “Flexible, weatherproof, strong. We
furnish rope for the monolines of Felissima, Bogover, Thelma, also
the long line to Grosgarth in Beaujolais and the line out to
Myrtlesee Fountain.”</p>
<p>  “Hm . . . And the monolines are fast
transportation?”</p>
<p>  The officer inspected him smilingly. “I assure
you.”</p>
<p>  “Just what is a monoline?”</p>
<p>  The officer laughed. “Now you joke with me. Come, I
will take you to Wittelhatch, and he will doubtless feast you at
his evening wassail. I understand an excellent conger bakes in his
oven this day.”</p>
<p>  “But our packs, our luggage! And the zipangotes,
they have not eaten yet, there is nothing in this swamp for them to
eat!”</p>
<p>  The officer signalled; four men stepped forward.
“Service and groom the beasts, feed them well, pluck their sores,
wash and bind their feet, set them out each a dram of dympel.“ He
said to Glystra. ”Your baggage will be secure, Swamp Island knows
no thieves. Merchants and industers we be, but robbers no, it is
against our rotes.“</p>
<p>  Wittelhatch was a fat man with round red face,
half-petulant, half-jocular, with crafty heavy-lidded eyes. He wore
a white blouse embroidered with red and yellow frogs, a red brocade
surcingle, tight blue trousers, black boots. In each ear hung a
gold ring and each finger was heavy with assorted metals. He sat in
a ceremonial chair, apparently having just lowered himself into
place, for he was yet wrestling with the folds of his garments.</p>
<p>  The officer bowed gracefully, indicated Glystra with
a debonair motion. “A traveller from the west, Lord.”</p>
<p>  “From the west?” Wittelhatch, narrow-eyed, rubbed
one of his sub-chins. “I understand that the highline across the
river has been cut. It will be necessary to kite it back into
place. How then did you cross?”</p>
<p>  Glystra explained the Magicker hoax. Wittelhatch
became shrill and angry. “The long white muckers—and all the
business I’ve sent them out of pity! Hey, but it discourages an
honest community to be set so close to rascals!”</p>
<p>  Glystra said with restrained impatience, “Our wish
is to proceed on our way. Your officer suggested that we use the
monoline.”</p>
<p>  Wittlehatch immediately became business-like. “How
many are in your party?”</p>
<p>  “Eight, together with our baggage.”</p>
<p>  Wittelhatch turned to the officer. “What do you
suggest, Clodleberg? Five singles and a pack?”</p>
<p>  The officer squinted thoughtfully. “Their baggage is
considerable. Better might be two packs and two singles. And since
they are unused to the trolleys, a guide.”</p>
<p>  “Where is your destination?” Wittelhatch
inquired.</p>
<p>  “As far east as possible.”</p>
<p>  “That’s Myrtlesee . . . Well now.” Wittelhatch
calculated. “I care little to let my trolleys journey to such vast
extents; you must pay substantially. If you buy the trolleys
outright—ninety ounces of good iron. If you rent—sixty ounces, plus
the guide’s pay and a reasonable return fee— another ten
ounces.”</p>
<p>  Glystra haggled politely, and reduced the rental to
fifty ounces plus the zipangotes, and Wittelhatch would pay the
guide. “Perhaps, Clodleberg, you would care to lead the party?”
Wittelhatch inquired of the young officer.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg twisted his blond mustache.</p>
<p>  “Delighted.”</p>
<p>  “Good,” said Glystra. “We’ll leave at once.”</p>
<p>  Wittelhatch rang a hand-bell. A porter appeared.
“Carry the baggage of these people to the take-off deck.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Wind blew in sails and trolley wheels whispered down
the monoline—a half-inch strand of white Swamp Island cable. From
the dome at Swamp City the line led from spine to spine across
three miles of swamp to a rocky headland, crossed over the rotten
basalt with only six feet to spare, swung in a wide curve to the
south-east. At fifty-foot intervals L-brackets mounted to poles
supported the line, so designed that the trolleys slid across with
only a tremor and slight thud of contact.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg rode the first trolley, Glystra followed,
then came a pair of three-wheel freight carriers loaded with
packs—food, spare clothing, the metal which represented their
wealth, Bishop’s vitamins, Cloyville’s camping gear, odds and ends
from the Beaujolain packs. The first of the freight-carriers was
manned by Corbus, Motta and Wailie; the second by Nancy, Pianza and
Bishop. Cloyville in a one-man trolley brought up the rear.</p>
<p>  As he examined the vehicle he rode in, Glystra well
understood Wittelhatch’s reluctance to part with it, even
temporarily. The wood was shaped and fitted with painstaking
precision, and performed as well as any metal machine from the
shops of Earth.</p>
<p>  The big wheel was laminated from ten separate
strips, glued, grooved and polished. Spokes of hardened withe
supported the central hub, whose bearings were wrought from a
greasy black hardwood. The seat support was a natural tree-crook,
connecting to a slatted floor below. Propulsion was achieved by
sails, set to a lateen boom. The halyards, outhauls and sheets led
to a cleat-board in front of the seat. Within reach was a double
hand-crank, offset like the pedals of a bicycle; turning the crank
would drive the trolley up any slight slope at the end of a long
suspension which momentum and the pressure of the sails were unable
to negotiate.</p>
<p>  At noon the land changed. Hills heaved up and it
became necessary to make portages, which involved carrying the
trolleys and all the baggage up to a higher level of line.</p>
<p>  At the end of the day they slept in a vacant cottage
near one of the portages and the next morning set off through the
mountains—the Wicksill Range, according to Clodle-berg. The line
swooped far across valleys, from ridge to ridge, with the ground
sometimes two thousand feet below. The trolleys, starting out
across such a valley, fell into the sag of the cable with a
stomach-lifting swoop, falling almost free; then out in the middle
the speed would slacken and the trolley would coast on momentum up
toward the opposite ridge and presently slow almost to a stop. Then
the sail would be trimmed to its fullest efficiency and the
drive-crank would be put into use, and gradually the trolley would
climb up to the high point.</p>
<p>  On the evening of the third day Clodleberg said,
“Tomorrow at this time we should be in Kirstendale, and you must be
surprised by nothing you see.”</p>
<p>  Glystra pressed for further information, but
Clodleberg was disposed to be jocular. “No, no. You will see for
yourself. Kirstendale is a city of great fascination. Possibly you
may abandon your fantastic journey and settle in Kirstendale.”</p>
<p>  “Are the people aggressive, unfriendly?”</p>
<p>  “Not in the slightest.”</p>
<p>  “Who rules them? What is their government?”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg raised his eyebrows thoughtfully. “Now
that you mention it, I have never heard of a ruler in Kirstendale.
Indeed, they rule themselves, if their life could be said to be
governed by rule.”</p>
<p>  Glystra changed the subject. “How many days from
Kirstendale to Myrtlesee Fountain?”</p>
<p>  “I’ve never made the trip,” said Clodleberg. “It is
not entirely pleasant. At certain seasons the Rebbirs come down
from the Eyrie to molest the monoline travellers, although the
Dongmen of Myrtlesee are Rebbir stock and try to maintain an open
avenue of communication.”</p>
<p>  “What lies past Myrtlesee Fountain?”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg made a gesture of disgust. “The desert.
The land of fire-eating dervishes; scavengers, blood-suckers, so
I’m told.”</p>
<p>  “And after?”</p>
<p>  “Then the Palo Malo Se Mountains and the
Blarengorran Lake. From the lake the Monchevior River runs east,
and you might float a considerable distance on one of the river
boats—how far I am uncertain, because it flows into the obscure and
unknown.“</p>
<p>  Glystra heaved a thoughtful sigh. By the time the
Monchevior River floated them out of Clodleberg’s ken, there would
still be thirty-nine thousand miles to Earth Enclave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  During the night a rainstorm broke upon the
mountain, and there was no escape from the roaring wind. The
travellers straggled up under the lee of a boulder and huddled
under their blankets while the Big Planet gale drove north.</p>
<p>  Wet and cold they saw a bleared gray dawn come and
for a time the rain stopped, though clouds fleeted past on the wind
almost within hand’s-reach overhead. Climbing upon their trolleys
they set handkerchiefs of sail and scudded along the monoline with
wheels whirring.</p>
<p>  For two hours the line led along the ridge, and the
wind pressed up and over the mountain like a water-spill. The
vegetation, low shrubs with tattered blue-green streamers of
leaves, whipped and flapped below. To the left was a dark valley
full of gray mist, to the right the clouds hid the panorama, but
when they broke and parted, a pleasant broken country could be
seen—hills, forests, small lakes, and several times they glimpsed
great stone castles.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg looked back at Glystra, swept his hand
over the land to the right. “The Galatudanian Valley, with the
Hibernian March below. A land of dukes and knights and barons,
stealing each other’s daughters and robbing one another . . .
Dangerous country to walk afoot.”</p>
<p>  The wind increased, buffeted the travellers until
tears flew from their eyes, and a fine driven spume stung their
cheeks. Heeling far to the side, the trolley skimmed southeast at
sixty miles an hour, and they might have travelled faster had not
Clodleberg constantly luffed wind from his sails.</p>
<p>  For an hour they wheeled along the line, swaying and
jerking, and then Clodleberg rose in his seat, signalled to furl
sail.</p>
<p>  The trolleys costed to a platform from which a line
led at a right angle to their course, down into the valley. The far
anchor was invisible; all that could be seen was the gradually
diminishing swoop of the white cable.</p>
<p>  Nancy peered down the line, drew back with a
shiver.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg grinned. “This is the easy direction.
Coming back, a person must make a two-day portage from the valley
floor.”</p>
<p>  “Do we slide down—out there?” asked Nancy in a
hushed voice.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg nodded, enjoying the trepidation which
the prospect of the drop aroused in his charges.</p>
<p>  “We’ll kill ourselves going so fast; it’s
so—steep!”</p>
<p>  “The wind presses on you, brakes your fall. There’s
nothing to it. Follow me. . . .”</p>
<p>  He turned his trolley down the slanting line, and in
an instant was a far dwindling shape vibrating down the wind.</p>
<p>  Glystra stirred himself. “I guess I’m next. ...”</p>
<p>  It was like stepping out into nothing, like diving
headfirst over a cliff. . . The first mile was almost free fall.
The wind buffeted, cloud-wisps whipped past, the land below was an
indeterminate blur.</p>
<p>  Overhead the wheel sang into high pitch, though it
carried almost no weight. The white line stretched out ahead,
always curving slightly up, away, out of vision.</p>
<p>  Glystra became aware that the whirr of the wheel was
decreasing in pitch; the line was flattening out, the ground below
was rising to meet him.</p>
<p>  Across a green and yellow forest he rolled and he
glimpsed below a settlement of log cabins, with a dozen children in
white smocks staring up ... Then they were gone and the forest was
dark and deep below. Flying insects darted up past his eyes, and
then ahead he saw a platform hung in the top of a giant tree, and
here waited Clodleberg.</p>
<p>  Glystra stiffly climbed to the platform. Clodleberg
was watching him with a crafty smile. “How did you like the
swoop?”</p>
<p>  “I’d like to move at that speed for three weeks.
We’d be at the Enclave.”</p>
<p>  The line began to quiver and sing. Looking back up,
Glystra saw the freight-carrier with Corbus, Motta and Wailie.</p>
<p>  “We might as well start off,” said Clodleberg.
“Otherwise the platform will be over-crowded.” He tested the wind,
shook his head. “Poor, a poor reach. We’ll have to trim our sails
closeby; the wind blows almost down the line . . . However fair
winds cannot be ours forever—and I believe the line veers presently
to the east, and we’ll make better time.”</p>
<p>  They set off, close-hauled, sailing so near into the
eye of the wind that the leach of the sail flapped constantly. The
line ran from tree-top to tree-top, and sometimes black-green
foliage brushed Glystra’s feet . . . Clodleberg had doused his
sail, was beckoning him urgently.</p>
<p>  “What’s the trouble?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Silence, signalled Clodleberg. He pointed ahead.
Glystra trundled his trolley forward, up against Clodleberg’s.
“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg was fixedly watching something on the
ground, through a gap in the foliage. “This is a dangerous part of
the line . . . Bands of soldiers, starving forest people, bandits .
. . Sometimes they wait till a trolley is over a high space, then
cut the line, killing the traveller. ...”</p>
<p>  Glystra saw movement through the leaves, a shifting
of white and gray. Clodleberg climbed from the trolley into the
branches of the tree, let himself cautiously down a few feet.
Glystra watched him quietly. Behind came the quiver of the next
trolley. Glystra signalled it to a halt.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg was motioning to him. Glystra left his
trolley, climbed to the crotch where Clodleberg stood. Through a
gap in the leaves he could see the floor of the forest. Behind a
low orange bush crouched three boys about ten years old. Bows and
arrows ready, they watched the line like cats at a mousehole.</p>
<p>  “Here’s where they get their early training,”
whispered Clodleberg. “When they grow larger they go to raiding the
towns of the March and all the Galatudanian Valley.” He quietly
nocked a quarrel into his cross-bow.</p>
<p>  “What are you going to do?” asked Glystra.</p>
<p>  “Kill the biggest . . . I’ll be saving the lives of
many innocent people.”</p>
<p>  Glystra struck up his arm; the bolt shattered a
branch over the head of the would-be assassins. Glystra saw their
white faces, big dark eyes, open frightened mouths; then they were
off, scurrying like rabbits.</p>
<p>  “Why did you do that?” asked Clodleberg heatedly.
“Those same skulkers may murder me on my way back to Swamp
City.”</p>
<p>  Glystra could find no words at first. Then he
muttered, “Sorry ... I suppose you’re right. But if this were
Earth, or any of the System planets, they’d be at their
schooling.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  A shaft of pure brilliance plunged down through the
sky— Big Planet sunlight. The rain-washed colors of the forest
shone with a glowing clarity never seen on Earth: black-greens,
reds, yellows, ochers, buffs, the lime-green of low hangworts, the
russet of bundle-bush. The wind blew high, blew low, the clouds
flew back across the mountains; they sailed in a fresh sunny
breeze.</p>
<p>  The monoline dropped down out of the forest,
stretched across a river-valley, over a swift river which
Clodleberg named the Thelma. They made a fifty foot portage up the
opposite bank, and set off once more across a land of peaceful
farms and stone houses, undistinguished except for the fact that
each house carried on its gable an intricate tangle of brambles and
spiny leaves.</p>
<p>  Glystra called to Clodleberg. “What on earth are
those bristling thorn-patches?”</p>
<p>  “Those are the ghost-catchers,” said Clodleberg
easily. “This section of country abounds with ghosts; there’s a
ghost for every house, sometimes more; and since they always give a
quick jump which takes them to the roof where they can walk back
and forth, the traps discourage them sadly . . . The very home of
ghosts is this Mankelly Parish, and witches too. . . .”</p>
<p>  Glystra thought that no matter how ordinary and
uneventful a Big Planet landscape might appear, it was still—Big
Planet.</p>
<p>  The monoline paralleled a rutted earthen road, and
three times the caravan, swinging along briskly with the breeze on
the beam, passed big red farm-wains with six-foot wooden wheels,
squeaking and groaning like scalded pigs. They were loaded with red
melon-bulbs, bundles of orange vine, baskets of green okra. The
lads who walked barefoot alongside goading the longnecked
zipangotes wore tall conical hats with veils of white cloth about
their faces.</p>
<p>  “To fool the ghosts?” Glystra asked Clodleberg.</p>
<p>  “To fool the ghosts.”</p>
<p>  Afternoon wore on; the country became verdant and
the ground supported every kind of pleasant growth. The farming
region fell behind; they seemed to be traversing a great
parkland.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg pointed ahead. “See there, that white
aquafer? There is your first glimpse of Kirstendale, the finest
city of the Galatudanian Valley. ...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Every Man a Millionaire!</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  For several minutes little enough of Kirstendale
could be seen: splashes of white through the trees, a pair of stone
causeways. The trolleys sailed across a pasture of red-green grass,
the trees parted, and there was the city, rising from a grassy
plain with blue mountains in the background.</p>
<p>  It was the largest and most elaborate settlement the
Earthmen had seen on Big Planet, but it was never a city which
might have existed on Earth. It reminded Glystra of the cloud-borne
castles in fairy-story illustrations.</p>
<p>  The line took a sudden turn and they came upon a
scene of gay activity, carnival color.</p>
<p>  A game was in progress. On the field were fifty men
and women in garments of remarkable complexity and elegance: silks,
satins, velvets, coarse tasselled weaves— tucked, flared, gored,
bedecked, be-ribboned, covered with tinsel and lace. The field was
laid off into squares by lines of colored grasses, cropped and
tended with the nicest precision, and each player occupied a single
square. Sheets of silk hung at each side from a row of moored
balloons. Each sheet glowed a different color: peach-tan,
orange-russet, blue, sea-green, rippling, shining in the breeze. A
myriad of small colored balls were in use, balls which
half-floated, almost as light as air. The players caught balls in a
manner which seemed to depend on the color of the ball, the color
of the player’s head-ribbon and the square where the player stood.
Balls filled the air, little sunlit jewels, and sometimes a player
would catch three balls at once and toss them away with great
dexterity. When a ball landed in one of the silken curtains, a
score was counted to the great jubilation of certain players and
spectators who cried, “Ohe, ohe, ohe!”</p>
<p>  Several hundred men and women watched the game from
the sidelines. They were dressed in the same extravagant fashion,
and in addition wore headgear of fantastic complexity, confections
most ingeniously designed and assembled. One young man displayed a
shell like an overturned boat, striped in bright green and scarlet.
Balls of fluorescent blue clung here and there to the fabric, and
tapes of golden taupe fluttered below. A great puff of bright
purple veil rose from the top, and imbedded in this veil were
globes of red, green, blue, yellow, shining like Christmas tree
ornaments ... A young woman—very beautiful, Glystra thought, supple
as a kitten, with sleek yellow hair and long yellow eyes—wore first
a cloche-helmet of soft leather from which rose a tall antenna, and
this antenna radiated prongs tipped with spangles of live
fire—vermilion, scintillant green, molten gold. . . .
Another—another—another: baroque, unique, incredible</p>
<p>  The monoline circled the field. The players and
spectators glanced up casually, returned to their game with
interest for nothing but the multiple flight of the colored
balls.</p>
<p>  Glystra noticed an attendant rolling a cart arrayed
with pink and white pastries. “Pianza—look what he’s wearing
...”</p>
<p>  Pianza snorted in surprise and amusement. “It’s a
tuxedo. Dinner jacket. Black tie. Stripe down the trousers, patent
leather shoes. Wonderful.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Out on the field a ball fell into the billowing
russet-gold curtain, rolled softly to the ground. There was joyous
applause from the spectators.</p>
<p>  Glystra slacked his sails, his trolley coasted
quietly along the line. The freight-flat behind, with Pianza and
Bishop, overtook him. Glystra spoke over his shoulder, “Bishop,
what does the Almanac say about Kirstendale? Anything
interesting?”</p>
<p>  Bishop came up to stand at the forward end of the
flat, under the lead wheel. He looked in frowning reflection toward
the looping walls. “Seems as if there’s a mystery of sorts—‘the
Kirstendale Paradox,’ that’s what they called it. It starts to come
back to me. A syndicate of millionaires established the town to
beat System taxes. A whole colony came out with their
servants—twenty or thirty families. Apparently—well,” he waved his
hand. “There’s the result.”</p>
<p>  The monoline veered once more, the breeze fell
astern. Sails spread out like butterfly wings, the caravan plunged
through an arch into the city, coasted up to a landing.</p>
<p>  Three quiet men in dark livery came foward,
wordlessly removed the packs from the trolley, put them into carts
with high spoked wheels. Glystra started to remonstrate, but
catching Clodleberg’s eye, desisted. “What’s happening?”</p>
<p>  “They assume that you are wealthy,” said Clodleberg,
“from the trolleys and the women.”</p>
<p>  “Humph,” grunted Glystra. “Am I supposed to tip
them?”</p>
<p>  “Do what?”</p>
<p>  “Give them money.”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg blinked, still perplexed.</p>
<p>  “Money. Metal.”</p>
<p>  “Ah, metal!” Clodleberg twisted his natty mustache.
“That is as you wish.”</p>
<p>  The head porter approached, a tall solemn-faced man
with carefully shaved cheeks, long sideburns terminating in a
little puff of whiskers: a man comporting himself with immense
dignity.</p>
<p>  Glystra handed him three small iron washers. “For
you and your men.”</p>
<p>  “Thank you, sir ... And where will you have your
luggage sent?”</p>
<p>  Glystra shrugged. “What are the choices?”</p>
<p>  “Well, there’s the Grand Savoyard and the Metropole
And the Ritz-Carlton—all excellent, all equally expensive.”</p>
<p>  “How expensive?”</p>
<p>  The head porter blinked, raised his black eyebrows
the faintest trifle. “Perhaps an ounce a week . . . The Traveller’s
Inn and the Fairmont are likewise expensive, but something quieter.
. . .”</p>
<p>  “What is a good inn of moderate rates?”</p>
<p>  The head porter clicked his heels. “I recommend the
Hunt Club. This way, sir, to the carriage.”</p>
<p>  He led them to a landau mounted on four elliptical
springs of laminated golden wood. There were no zipan-gotes hitched
to the front, in fact the carriage appeared innocent of motive
power.</p>
<p>  The head porter swung open the door with a flourish.
Cloyville, in the lead, hesitated, looked quizzically back over his
shoulder. “A joke? After we get in, do you walk away and leave us
sitting here?”</p>
<p>  “No indeed, sir, by no means.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville gingerly climbed up the two steps, lowered
himself into the soft seat. The rest of the party followed.</p>
<p>  The head porter closed the door with exquisite
finesse, signalled. Four men in tight black uniforms stepped
forward; each clipped a strap to the front of the carriage, tossed
it over his shoulder, and the carriage was underway. Wooden
planking rumbled below the wheels, the hangar-like buildings were
behind, they drove over granite flags through the heart of the
city.</p>
<p>  Kirstendale had been laid out with an eye to
striking vistas. It was a city clean as new paper, bright with
polished stone and glass, gay with flowers. Towers rose everywhere,
each circled by a staircase which spiralled up to meet the
onion-shaped bulb of the dwelling.</p>
<p>  They approached a cylindrical building in the middle
of the city, large as a gas-storage tank. A lush growth of
blue-green vine with maroon trumpet-flowers, rows of large windows
gave a sense of lightness and elegance to an otherwise heavy
building.</p>
<p>  The carriage passed under a marquee roofed with
stained glass, and the Big Planet sunlight, passing through,
puddled the flags with gorgeous color. A sign on the marquee read,
“Hotel Metropole.”</p>
<p>  “Hm,” said Cloyville. “Looks like a nice place . . .
After the—well, inconvenience of the journey, I could stand a week
or two in the lap of luxury.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  But the carriage continued around the building,
presently passed another marquee. This was draped in rich saffron
satin, fringed with royal red tassels. A sign read “Grand
Savoyard.”</p>
<p>  Next they passed a portico of somewhat classical
dignity: columns, Ionic capitals and entablature. Chiselled letters
read “Ritz-Carlton,” and again Cloyville looked wistfully over his
shoulder as the carriage swept by. “We’ll probably end up on a
flop-house on the skid-road.”</p>
<p>  They passed a vaguely Oriental entrance: carved dark
wood, a slab of the same wood supporting tall green urns. The sign
read, “The Traveller’s Inn.”</p>
<p>  The carriage continued another hundred feet and
stopped under an awning of green, red and white striped canvas. A
bold black and white sign announced “The Hunt Club.”</p>
<p>  A doorman stepped forward, helped them to the
pavement, then ran ahead, opened the door.</p>
<p>  The party of travellers passed through a short
corridor pasted with green baize, decorated with black and white
landscapes, entered a large central lobby.</p>
<p>  Directly opposite, across the lobby, a corridor led
outside. Through the door shone the many-colored radiance of
stained-glass in the sunlight.</p>
<p>  Glystra looked around the walls. At intervals other
corridors led off like spokes from a hub, all evidently leading to
the outside.</p>
<p>  Glystra stopped short. Grinning he turned to Pianza.
“The Metropole, the Grand Savoyard, the Ritz-Carlton, the
Traveller’s Inn, the Hunt Club—they’re all the same.”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg made an urgent motion. “Quiet. This is
very real to the Kirsters. You will offend them.”</p>
<p>  “But—”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg said hurriedly, “I should have informed
you; the entrance you chose places you on the social scale. The
accommodations are identical, but it is considered smarter and more
fashionable to enter through the Metropole.”</p>
<p>  Glystra nodded. “I understand completely. We’ll be
careful.”</p>
<p>  The doorman led them across the lobby to a circular
desk with a polished wood counter. Rods wound with spirals of
colored cloth rising from the edge of the counter supported a
parasol-shaped top. A central pier continued up three feet, then
extended in a ten foot pole of pitted black wood. Around the pole,
veering in and out, flew ten thousand fireflies—swooping, circling,
settling on the pitted wood of the pole, flying out again in a
swift current, ten, twenty, fifty feet from the pole.</p>
<p>  The doorman took them to that section of the desk
marked off by the Hunt Club colors. Glystra turned around, counted
heads, like the father of a troublesome family. Cloyville, ruddy
and flushed, was talking to a tired Pianza; Corbus and Bishop stood
with Wailie and Motta, the girls excited, vastly impressed; Nancy
stood pale and rather tense by his right elbow, Clodleberg at his
left. Nine in all.</p>
<p>  “Excuse me, sir,” said the desk clerk. “Are you Mr
Claude Glystra, of Earth?”</p>
<p>  Glystra swung around in surprise. “Why do you
ask?”</p>
<p>  “Sir Walden Marchion extends his compliments, and
begs that you and your party honor him by residing at his villa the
period of your stay. He has sent his carriage for your use, if you
will so favor him.”</p>
<p>  Glystra turned to Clodleberg, spoke in a cold voice.
“How did this Sir Walden Marchion know of our arrival?”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg flushed, preened his mustaches
furiously.</p>
<p>  “Who’s been talking?”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg said with immense dignity, “The head
porter at the landing inquired your identity ... I saw no reason to
conceal it. You had issued no orders to that effect.”</p>
<p>  Glystra turned away. If any harm was to result from
the indiscretion, the harm was by now done; no benefit would come
of dressing down Clodleberg, for whom, in general, he felt a high
regard. “News certainly travels fast in Kirstendale . . . What is
your opinion in regard to the invitation?”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg turned to the desk clerk. “Exactly who is
Sir Walden Marchion?”</p>
<p>  “One of the wealthiest and most influential men in
Kirstendale. A very distinguished gentleman.”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg fondled his mustache. “Unusual, but
gratifying . . .” He surveyed Glystra with a new appraisal. “I see
no reason to decline.”</p>
<p>  Glystra said to the desk clerk, “We’ll accept the
invitation.”</p>
<p>  The desk clerk nodded. “I’m sure that you’ll find
your visit pleasant. Sir Walden has served meat at his table on
several occasions . . . The carriage is awaiting. Ah, Man-ville, if
you will ...” He signalled to the clerk at the Grand Savoyard
sector of the desk. This clerk nodded to a young man in a rich
black livery with yellow piping down the sides, who clicked his
heels, bowed, stalked out the Grand Savoyard entrance and a moment
later reappeared in the Hunt Club corridor. He strode up to
Glystra, clicked his heels, bowed.</p>
<p>  “Sir Walden’s carriage, sir.”</p>
<p>  “Thank you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Careful not to commit the <em>faux pas</em> of
leaving by the Travellers Inn entrance, the party returned outside,
climbed into a long low brougham. The doorman closed the door, the
carriage driver said, “Your luggage will be conveyed to Sir
Walden’s.”</p>
<p>  “Such courtesy,” murmured Pianza. “Such unbelievable
punctilio!”</p>
<p>  Cloyville sank back in the deep cushioned seats with
a sigh. “I’m afraid that I like it. Guess I’m soft, or possibly an
anachronism. I’ll have to admit that all this feudalism finds a
customer in me.”</p>
<p>  “I wonder,” said Glystra, watching out the window,
“what the desk clerk meant when he said that Sir Walden often
served meat.”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg blew out his cheeks. “Easily explained.
By a peculiar freak the Galatudanian Valley supports no animal life
other than the zipangotes, whose flesh is so rank as to be
inedible. A parasitic insect deadly to creatures with fur, scales
or floss is responsible. The zipangote, with his naked hide, is not
troubled. The Kirsters therefore subsist on vegetable food, fruits,
yeast, fungus, an occasional water-creature, certain varieties of
insect, and on rare occasions, meat, imported from
Coelanvilli.”</p>
<p>  The carriage, drawn by five runners in Sir Walden’s
black livery, trundled across the pavement. They passed a row of
shops. The first displayed delicate creations of gauze and puff,
the second sold flagons carved of green chert and mottled blue
soapstone. The next booth offered pom-poms of twirled green and
rose satin, the next was a jewellery, with trays full of glinting
lights, next a display of glassware—goblets exceedingly tall and
slender, with tiny cups and long fine stems, and the window
glittered and glistened in vertical lines and diamond-colored
striations.</p>
<p>  “I’m rather interested in the economy,” said
Cloyville. “Somewhere these goods are fabricated. Where? By whom?
Slaves? It takes lots of production to support this kind of a
set-up. Expensive leisure classes—like that.” He pointed to a plaza
where men and women in extravagant clothes sat listening to seven
young girls playing flutes and singing in clear sweet voices.</p>
<p>  Glystra scratched his head. “I don’t see how they do
it. They certainly can’t be supplied from Earth. . . .”</p>
<p>  “Evidently this is their secret,” said Pianza. “The
Kirstendale Paradox.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville said with an air of finality, “Whatever it
is, it seems to suit everybody; everybody seems happy.”</p>
<p>  “Everybody in sight,” said Corbus.</p>
<p>  Wailie and Motta had been chattering—bright-eyed,
excited. Glystra watched them a moment, wondering what was going on
in their brains . . . They had filled out, their cheeks were no
longer hollow, their hair was glossy and well-tended, they were
pretty girls. Corbus and Bishop were modestly proud of them. Corbus
patted Motta’s head. “See anything you’d like?”</p>
<p>  “Oh, yes! Jewels and metal and lovely cloth, and
ribbons and spangles and those lovely sandals. ...”</p>
<p>  Corbus winked at Bishop. “Clothes, clothes,
clothes.”</p>
<p>  “<em>Le plus de la différence, le plus de la même
chose</em>” said Bishop.</p>
<p>  The carriage turned among the towers—graceful spires
swooping up to the onion-shaped dwellings.</p>
<p>  The carriage halted by a pale green column; a
servant swung wide the door. “The castle of Sir Walden Marchion
...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Kirstendale Idyll</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The party alighted, the carriage swept off.</p>
<p>  “This way if you please. ...”</p>
<p>  They climbed the stairs, spiralling up to the
beetling shape of Sir Walden’s castle. Buttress vanes sprang out
from the central column, elbowing up and out to the outer
flange.</p>
<p>  Corbus felt one of the vanes—a parchment-tan
material two inches thick. “Wood . . . Looks like it grows right
out of the trunk.” He cocked his head up to where the floor swelled
out in a smooth curve. “These things grew here! They’re big
plants!”</p>
<p>  The servant looked back, his black brows in a
straight disapproving line. “This is the castle of Sir Walden, his
manse. . . .”</p>
<p>  Corbus winked at Glystra. “Guess I was wrong; it’s
not a big acorn after all.”</p>
<p>  “Certainly not,” said the servant.</p>
<p>  The stairway made one last swoop far out from the
central column, apparently supported by its own structural
strength; then the party stood on a wide plat, swept by the cool
Big Planet breezes.</p>
<p>  The servant flung open the door, stood aside. Sir
Walden’s guests entered the sky-castle.</p>
<p>  They stood in a large room, light and airy,
decorated with an unobtrusive intricacy. The floor was not level,
but flared like a trumpet bell. A pool of water dyed bright blue
filled the depression in the center. Insects with white gauzy wings
and feelers scuttled and ran back and forth across the surface,
trailing V-ripples which sparkled momentarily green. The floor
surrounding the pool was covered by a carpet woven from dark and
light-green floss; the walls were bright blue, except where a
frieze in sharp black and white, of blank-faced men with owl-insect
eyes, occupied one wall.</p>
<p>  “Be at your ease,” said the servant. “Sir Walden is
on his way to welcome you; in the meanwhile dispose yourselves as
you will. Refreshing ichors are at your disposal, in three
vintages: maychee, worm, vervaine; pray be so good as to enjoy
them.”</p>
<p>  He bowed, withdrew. The travellers were alone.</p>
<p>  Glystra sighed heavily. “Looks like a nice place . .
. Doesn’t seem to be a jail. . . .”</p>
<p>  Five minutes passed before Sir Walden appeared—a
tall man, sober-faced, rather gravely beautiful. He apologized for
not being on hand to greet them, professing himself delayed beyond
remedy elsewhere.</p>
<p>  Glystra, when he found opportunity, muttered aside
to Pianza, “Where have we seen him before? Or have we?”</p>
<p>  Pianza shook his head. “Nowhere to my knowledge.
...”</p>
<p>  Two lads of fourteen and sixteen wearing pink,
yellow and green, with curl-toed sandals of remarkable design,
entered the room. They bowed. “At your service, friends from Mother
Earth.”</p>
<p>  “My sons,” said Sir Walden, “Thane and Halmon.”</p>
<p>  Glystra said, “We are delighted to enjoy the
hospitality of your house, Sir Walden, but—bluntly—may I inquire
why it has been extended to us, complete strangers that we
are?”</p>
<p>  Sir Walden made an elegant gesture. “Please . . . We
will chat far and long—but now, you are weary and travel-worn. So
you shall be refreshed.” He clapped his hands. “Servants!”</p>
<p>  A dozen men and women appeared. “Baths for our
guests scented with—” he kneaded his chin with his hand, as if the
matter required the utmost nicety of judgment. He arrived at a
decision. “—with Nigali No. 29, that will be most suitable, and let
there be new garments for their comfort.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville sighed. “A bath . . . Hot water. ...”</p>
<p>  “Thank you,” said Glystra shortly. Sir Walden’s
hospitality was still a mystery.</p>
<p>  A servant stood before him, bowed. “This way,
sir.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  He was conveyed to a pleasant chamber high above the
city. An expressionless young man in tight black livery took his
clothes. “Your bath is through this door, Lord Glystra.”</p>
<p>  Glystra stepped into a small room with walls of
seamless mother-of-pearl. Warm water rose up around his knees, his
waist, his chest. Foam, bubbles surged up under his feet, rushed up
past his tingling body, burst into his face with a pleasant sharp
fragrance. Glystra sighed, relaxed, floated.</p>
<p>  The fragrance of the foam shifted, changed, always
new, now tart, now sweet. Bubbles kneaded his skin, flushed it free
of grime and perspiration, toned, stimulated, and fatigue was gone,
leaving behind a pleasant soft weariness.</p>
<p>  The water level dropped swiftly, warm air gushed
around him. He pushed open the door.</p>
<p>  The man had disappeared. A girl carrying a towel on
two outstretched arms stood before him smiling. She wore a short
black skirt, no more. Her body was tan and lovely, her hair
arranged in a stylized loose swirl.</p>
<p>  “I am your room-servant. However, if you find me
unpleasant or unsuitable, I will go.”</p>
<p>  She seemed very sure that he would find her neither.
Glystra stood still a moment, then seized the towel, wrapped
himself in it.</p>
<p>  “Does—um, everyone get a playmate?”</p>
<p>  She nodded.</p>
<p>  “The women too?”</p>
<p>  She nodded again. “That they may welcome you with
renewed pleasure when at last you depart.”</p>
<p>  “Mmmph,” snorted Glystra. He wondered about the man
now possibly standing before the naked Nancy. “Mmmph.”</p>
<p>  He said with a brusqueness and finality he did not
altogether feel, “Give me my clothes.”</p>
<p>  With no change in expression, she brought him
Kirstendale garments, assisted him into the intricate folds, tucks
and drapes.</p>
<p>  At last she pronounced him dressed. He wore a
garment of green and blue in which he felt awkward and ridiculous.
The first piece of head-gear she brought forward, a tall tricorn
dangling a dozen wooden sound-blocks, he refused even to allow on
his head. The girl insisted that a man without a head-ornament
would be a spectacle for derision, and finally he allowed her to
pull a loose black velvet beret over his cropped black poll, and
before he could protest she had fixed a string of scarlet beads so
as to hang over one ear.</p>
<p>  She stood back, admired him. “Now my lord is a lord
among lords . . . Such a presence. ...”</p>
<p>  “I feel like a lord among jackasses,” muttered
Glystra. He went to the door, but the girl was there before him to
sweep it open. Glystra frowned, stalked through, wondering if Sir
Walden had also arranged to have him fed with a spoon.</p>
<p>  He descended to the main hall. Sunset light poured
in through the mullioned windows. A pair of lads placed screens of
violet and green satin where they would glow to the best advantage.
A round table was spread with heavy ivory cloth, and set with
fourteen places.</p>
<p>  The plates were marble, thin and fragile, apparently
carved and worked by hand; the implements were carved from a hard
black wood.</p>
<p>  One by one Glystra’s companions arrived—the men
sheepish in their new garments, the girls sparkling and radiant.
Nancy wore pale green, pink and white. When she entered the room
Glystra hastily sought her eye, hoping to read how she had disposed
of the companion assigned her by the painstaking Sir Walden. She
looked away, would not meet his eye. Glystra clamped his mouth,
scowled toward the blue pool in the center of the room.</p>
<p>  Sir Walden appeared and with him his two sons, a
daughter, and a tall woman in billows of lavender lace whom he
introduced as his wife.</p>
<p>  Dinner was a splendid event, course after course,
dishes of unfamiliar, odd-tasting food, all elaborately prepared
and served: greens, fibers, cereals, fungus, fruits, thistles,
succulent stems, prepared in starchy coverings like ravioli, spicy
goulashes, croquettes, pastries, jellies, salads. The variety was
such that it came as a slight shock when Glystra realized that the
meal was entirely vegetarian— with the exception of certain
ambiguous hashes, which he took to be of insect origin, and
avoided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  After dinner there was oil-smooth liquor and much
talk. Glystra’s head swam with the dinner wine, and the liquor
relaxed him completely. He leaned toward Sir Walden.</p>
<p>  “Sir, you have not yet explained your interest in us
casual passers-by.”</p>
<p>  Sir Walden made a delicate grimace. “Surely it is a
trivial matter. Since I enjoy your company, and you must rest your
heads somewhere—what is the difference?”</p>
<p>  “It is a matter which disturbs me,” protested
Glystra. “Every human act is the result of some impulse; the nature
of the impulse which caused you to send the messenger for us preys
on my mind ... I hope you will forgive my insistence. . . .”</p>
<p>  Sir Walden smiled, toyed with a bit of fruit. “Some
of us here in Kirstendale subscribe to the Doctrine of Illogical
Substitution, which in many respects disputes your theory of
causation. And then there is the Tempofluxion Dogma—very
interesting, although I for one cannot entirely accept the
implications. Possibly the central postulates are unknown on Earth?
The advouters claim that as the river of time flows past and
through us, our brains are disturbed—jostled, if you will—by
irregularities, eddies, in the flow of the moments. They believe
that if it were possible to control the turbulence in the river, it
would be possible to manipulate creative ability in human minds.
What do you say to that?”</p>
<p>  “That I still wonder why you asked us to be your
guests.”</p>
<p>  Sir Walden laughed helplessly. “Very well, you might
as well learn the inconsequential truth—and learn the
inconsequentially of our lives in Kirstendale.” He leaned forward,
as if resolved on candor. “We Kirsters love novelty—the new, the
fresh, the exciting. You are Earth-men. No Earthmen have passed
through Kirstendale for fifty years. Your presence in my house not
only affords me the pleasure of new experience, but also adds to my
prestige in the town . . . You see, I am perfectly frank, even to
my disadvantage.”</p>
<p>  “I see,” said Glystra. The explanation appeared
reasonable.</p>
<p>  “I was quick with my invitation. Undoubtedly you
would have received a dozen others inside the hour. But I have
connections with the depot agent.”</p>
<p>  Glystra tried to remember the head porter at the
landing, who must have relayed the information almost instantly to
Sir Walden.</p>
<p>  Sir Walden cared little for answering Glystra’s
questions; he preferred to discuss contemporary Earth culture, a
lead which Glystra followed, to please his host.</p>
<p>  The evening passed. Glystra, head spinning from the
wine and liquor, was conducted to his room. Waiting to undress him
was the girl who had helped him into his clothes. She moved on
soundless bare feet, murmuring softly as she unclasped the buckles,
untied the hundred and one ribbons, bindings, tassels. Glystra was
drowsy. Her voice was warm and heady as mulled wine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The morning attendant was a thin-faced young man,
who dressed Glystra after his morning bath in silence.</p>
<p>  Glystra hurried to the main hall, anxious to find
Nancy. How had she spent the night? The question throbbed at the
back of his mind like a bubble of stagnant blood. But she was not
yet in evidence. Pianza and Corbus sat alone at the table, eating
pink melon.</p>
<p>  Corbus was speaking. “—I think I’ll trade Motta in
on this yellow-haired girl. That’s the way to cross a planet, wench
by wench!”</p>
<p>  Glystra muttered a greeting, sat down. A moment
later Nancy entered the room, fresh, blue-eyed, more beautiful than
Glystra had ever remembered her. He half-rose to his feet, caught
her eye. She nodded casually, dropped into the seat opposite him,
began to dip into the pink melon.</p>
<p>  Glystra returned to his own food. Big Planet was not
Earth. He could not judge a Big Planet girl by Earth standards . .
. During breakfast he tried to fathom her mind. She was pleasant,
detached, cool.</p>
<p>  One by one the party entered the hall, until at last
everyone was present. Except—</p>
<p>  “Where’s Cloyville?” asked Pianza. “Doesn’t he plan
to get up?” He turned to a servant. “Will you please arouse Mr
Cloyville?”</p>
<p>  The servant returned. “Mr Cloyville is not in his
room.”</p>
<p>  Cloyville was not seen all day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  It was possible, said Sir Walden, that he had wished
to explore the town on foot. Glystra, with no other hypothesis to
offer, concurred politely. If Cloyville had indeed wandered off, he
would return when he felt so inclined. If he had been taken against
his will, Glystra was unable to formulate a plan to retrieve him.
Words would avail nothing ... It might be wise, thought Glystra, to
leave Kirstendale as soon as possible. He said as much at
lunch.</p>
<p>  Wailie and Motta were downcast, and toyed with their
food sulkily. “Best we should remain here in Kirstendale,” said
Wailie. “Everyone is gay; there is no beating of the woman, and a
great deal of food.”</p>
<p>  “Of course there is no meat,” Motta pointed out,
“but who cares? The fabrics and the perfumed water and—” she
glanced at Wailie and giggled. They looked at Corbus and Bishop,
and giggled again.</p>
<p>  Bishop blushed, sipped green fruit juice. Corbus
raised his eyebrows sardonically. Glystra chuckled; then, thinking
of Nancy, asked himself ruefully, what am I laughing at?</p>
<p>  Sir Walden said gravely, “I have a rather pleasant
surprise for you. Tonight, at our evening meal, there will be
meat—a dish prepared in honor of our guests.”</p>
<p>  He looked from face to face, half-smiling, waiting
for the expected enthusiasm. Then: “But perhaps for you, meat is
not the gala event it is for us ... Also, I have been asked to
convey the invitation of my Lord Sir Clarence Attlewee to a soiree
at his castle this evening. It has likewise been planned in your
honor, and he hopes you will accept.”</p>
<p>  “Thank you,” said Glystra. “Speaking for myself,
I’ll be delighted.” He looked around the circle of faces. “I think
we’ll all be there . . . Even Cloyville, if he shows up.”</p>
<p>  During the afternoon Sir Walden took them to what he
called a “pressing.” It proved to be a ceremonial squeezing of
essence from a vat of flowing petals. Two hundred of the
aristocrats appeared, wearing green and gray headgear, which Sir
Walden described as traditional for the occasion.</p>
<p>  Glystra looked about the plaza, along the ranks of
gay careless faces. “A good proportion of the upper classes must be
present, I would imagine,” he said idly to Sir Walden.</p>
<p>  Sir Walden stared straight ahead, and not a muscle
moved on his face. “There are others, many others.”</p>
<p>  “What is the population of Kirstendale, Sir
Walden?”</p>
<p>  Sir Walden made a non-committal gesture. “It is at
best a speculation. I have no figures.”</p>
<p>  “And what is your speculation?”</p>
<p>  Sir Walden darted him a brilliant glance. “We are a
proud race, proud and sensitive. And we have our Secret.”</p>
<p>  “Excuse me.”</p>
<p>  “Of course.”</p>
<p>  The booms which radiated like spokes from the press
were bedecked like a maypole, and manned by children. Round and
round and round, chanting a shrill song— round and round. Flower
fumes rose into the air, and trickle of yellow-green syrup dripped
from the spout. Round and round. Essence of white blossoms, lush
yellow petals, blue flake-flowers . . . The children bore tiny cups
through the crowd, each containing a few drops of essence. Sir
Walden said, “Bring your tongue almost to the liquid, but do not
quite taste it.”</p>
<p>  Glystra bent his head, followed the instructions. A
wave of pungent fragrance swept through his throat, his nose, his
entire head. His eyes swam, his head reeled, momentarily dizzy in a
kind of floral ecstasy.</p>
<p>  “Exquisite,” he gasped when he was able to
speak.</p>
<p>  Sir Walden nodded. “That was the Baie-Jolie press.
Next will be a heavy Purple Woodmint, then a Marine Garden, then a
Rose Thyme, and last my favorite, the fascinating Meadow Harvest
Sachet.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>The Secret</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Through the afternoon the travellers revelled in
perfume, and at last, half-intoxicated from gorgeous odors, they
returned to Sir Walden’s castle.</p>
<p>  Inquiry revealed that Cloyville had not yet
returned.</p>
<p>  Glystra bathed with a troubled mind. Awaiting him
with a towel was the same smiling girl who had served him
yesterday. Today she wore, in addition to her short black skirt, a
string of red coral beads around her neck.</p>
<p>  Sighing, half in frustration, Glystra allowed
himself to be arrayed in fresh clothes.</p>
<p>  Sir Walden was more attentive and gracious than ever
this evening; repeatedly he toasted his guests and planet Earth in
wines first green, then orange, then red, and Glystra’s head was
light before the first series of courses was served.</p>
<p>  Course after course: hot pickled fruit, slabs of
nutty yeast spread with sweet syrups, salads, croquettes garnished
with crisp water-weed—and presently a great tureen was wheeled in,
a pottery bowl glazed in stripes of brown, black and green.</p>
<p>  Sir Walden himself served the meat—slices of pale
roast swimming in rich brown gravy.</p>
<p>  Glystra found himself replete, without further
appetite, and merely toyed with his portion. Sir Walden and his
lady ate with silent concentration, for a moment quiet.</p>
<p>  Glystra asked suddenly, “What kind of animal
furnishes the meat?”</p>
<p>  Sir Walden looked up, wiped his lips with a napkin.
“A rather large beast, seldom seen in these parts. It seems to have
wandered down from the north woods; by rare luck we procured it;
its meat is superlatively delicious.”</p>
<p>  “Indeed,” said Glystra. Looking about he noticed
Pianza and Bishop had likewise left their plates untouched. Corbus
and Clodleberg still had appetite, and ate the meat with relish, as
did Nancy and the gypsy girls.</p>
<p>  At the final course—a rich cheese-like substance—
Glystra said suddenly, “I think Sir Walden, that tomorrow we will
take our leave of Kirstendale.”</p>
<p>  Sir Walden paused in his eating. “What? So
soon?”</p>
<p>  “We have far to go, and the monoline takes us but a
short distance along the way.”</p>
<p>  “But—your friend Cloyville?”</p>
<p>  “If he is found—” he paused. “If he returns, he
possibly may be able to overtake us. I feel that we had better go
before—ah, any of us wander away.”</p>
<p>  “You’re spoiling us for the tough life we have
ahead,” said Pianza. “Another week here and I couldn’t bring myself
to leave.”</p>
<p>  Sir Walden politely expressed his regret. “I invited
you as curiosities of the moment; now I look upon you as my
friends.”</p>
<p>  A coach came to convey the party to Sir Clarence
Attlewee’s soiree. Sir Walden stood back.</p>
<p>  “But do you not come with us?” asked Glystra.</p>
<p>  “No,” said Sir Walden. “I will be occupied this
evening.”</p>
<p>  Glystra slowly took his seat in the carriage.
Automatically he felt to his side—but he had left his weapon in his
room. He whispered to Corbus, “Tonight—don’t drink too much. I
think that we had better keep our heads clear . . . For what—I
don’t know.”</p>
<p>  “Right.”</p>
<p>  The carriage stopped by a column painted blue-white,
and the party was conducted up a spiral staircase much like Sir
Walden Marchion’s.</p>
<p>  Sir Clarence, a man with a heavy chin and snapping
eyes, greeted his guests at the head of the stairs. Glystra stared
at him. Somewhere, somehow, Sir Clarence’s face was familiar to
him. He stammered, “Haven’t we met, Sir Clarence? This afternoon at
the pressing?”</p>
<p>  “I think not,” said Sir Clarence. “I was otherwise
occupied today.”</p>
<p>  “I feel I’ve spoken to you before. Your voice is
familiar-”</p>
<p>  Sir Clarence shook his head. “I’m afraid not.” He
conducted them into his home. “Allow me to present my wife-” He did
so. “And Valery, my daughter . . .” Glystra’s mouth fell open.</p>
<p>  Here was the girl who, nearly naked, waited to serve
him when he left his bath.</p>
<p>  He leaned forward. Or was she? She regarded him with
impersonal interest, frowning slightly as if puzzled by his
interest. Glystra mumbled, “Charmed to make your aquaintance,” and
she moved away.</p>
<p>  Watching the swing of her body in its complicated
wrappings of silk and toile and net, Glystra was certain that she
was the same girl.</p>
<p>  Bishop nudged him. “There’s something rather
pecu-liar—”</p>
<p>  “What?”</p>
<p>  “Our host Sir Clarence—I’ve seen him before.”</p>
<p>  “So have I.”</p>
<p>  “Where? Do you remember?”</p>
<p>  “At the Hunt Club?”</p>
<p>  Bishop snapped his fingers. “That’s it.”</p>
<p>  “Who is he?”</p>
<p>  “Sir Clarence is—or was—the doorman at the Hunt
Club.”</p>
<p>  Glystra stared, first at Bishop, then at Sir
Clarence, who now was speaking with Nancy.</p>
<p>  Bishop was right.</p>
<p>  Behind him he heard a booming laugh, a great roar of
merriment. “Haw, haw, haw! Look at that!”</p>
<p>  It was Corbus’ laugh, and Corbus laughed only
rarely.</p>
<p>  Glystra whirled. He looked face to face with
Cloyville.</p>
<p>  Cloyville wore a black livery, with tiny gold
epaulettes. He pushed a cart laden with canapes.</p>
<p>  Glystra broke into laughter, as did Bishop and
Pianza. Cloyville blushed, a tide of red rising up his bull neck,
over his cheeks. He darted an appealing glance toward Sir Clarence,
who watched him impassively.</p>
<p>  “Well, Cloyville,” said Glystra, “suppose you let us
in on it ... Picking up a little spare change during your
stay?”</p>
<p>  “Care for hors d’oeuvres, sir?” asked Cloyville
tonelessly.</p>
<p>  “No, damn it. No hors d’oeuvres. Just an
explanation.”</p>
<p>  “Thank you, sir,” said Cloyville and rolled his cart
away.</p>
<p>  Glystra turned to Sir Clarence. “What’s going on?
What’s the joke?”</p>
<p>  Sir Clarence wore a puzzled look. “The man is new to
my employ. He came to me well recommended—”</p>
<p>  Glystra wheeled, strode after Cloyville, who seemed
intent on rolling his cart out of the room.</p>
<p>  “Cloyville!” barked Glystra. “We’re going to thrash
this thing out right here.”</p>
<p>  “Quiet!” hissed Cloyville. “It’s not polite to
create such a disturbance.”</p>
<p>  “Thank God I’m not an aristocrat then.”</p>
<p>  “But I am—and you’re hurting my prestige!”</p>
<p>  Glystra blinked. “You? An aristocrat? You’re just a
flunky pushing around a tray of sandwiches.”</p>
<p>  “Everybody’s the same way,” said Cloyville
dispiritedly. “Everybody works. Everybody is everybody else’s
servant. How do you suppose they keep up the front?”</p>
<p>  Glystra sat down. “But—”</p>
<p>  Cloyville said savagely, “I decided I liked it here.
I want to stay. I’ve had enough of tramping across forty thousand
miles of jungle, getting killed. I asked Sir Walden if I could
stay. He said yes, but he told me I’d have to work like everybody
else, and work hard. There’s not a more industrious people in space
than the Kirsters. They know what they want, they work for it. For
every hour of swanking around as an aristocrat they put in two
working—in the shops, the factories, in the homes. Usually all
three. Instead of living one life, they live two or three. They
love it, thrive on it. I like it too. I’ve decided I’m built the
same way. Call me a snob,” he shouted, voice rising angrily. “I
admit it. But while you and the others are rotting your bones out
in the muck I’ll be living here like a king!”</p>
<p>  “That’s all right, Cloyville,” said Glystra mildly.
“Or perhaps I should say, Sir Cloyville. Why couldn’t you tell me
of your plans?”</p>
<p>  Cloyville turned away. “I thought you’d try to argue
with me. Or talk about duty, rot like that—”</p>
<p>  “Not at all,” said Glystra. “You’re a free agent.”
He turned away. “I wish you luck. I hope you’ll like it here. If we
ever get to the Enclave I’ll send a plane back to pick you up. . .
.” He returned to the main hall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Early the next morning a carriage called at the
castle of Sir Walden Marchion. Scrutinizing the men who pulled the
carriage, Glystra recognized one of Sir Clarence’s sons.</p>
<p>  Wailie and Motta were missing. Glystra asked Bishop,
“Where’s your girl friend?”</p>
<p>  Bishop shook his head. “She had breakfast with
me.”</p>
<p>  “Did she know we were leaving?”</p>
<p>  “Well—yes.”</p>
<p>  Glystra turned to Corbus. “How about Motta?”</p>
<p>  Corbus looked at Bishop. “Let’s face it.” He
grinned. “We’re just not the men these Kirsters are ...”</p>
<p>  Glystra could not prevent himself from glancing
swiftly toward Nancy. There she was, pale, rather taut—but there
she was. He smiled at her, uncertainly. There was still distance
between them.</p>
<p>  He turned back to Corbus and Bishop. “Do you want to
look for them?”</p>
<p>  Corbus shook his head. “They’re better off
here.”</p>
<p>  “Let’s go,” said Bishop.</p>
<p>  At the monoline station, the head porter reached
into the carriage, unloaded the packs, to a cart, wheeled them to
the trolleys.</p>
<p>  Glystra winked at his fellows. The porter was Sir
Walden Marchion.</p>
<p>  With a straight face Glystra tipped him once again,
three small iron washers.</p>
<p>  Sir Walden bowed low. “Thank you very much,
sir.”</p>
<p>  Kirstendale dwindled in the west. As before
Clodleberg rode in the lead, with Glystra following. Then came the
first freight carrier with Corbus and Nancy, then the second with
Bishop and Pianza. Cloyville’s trolley had been left behind at
Kirstendale.</p>
<p>  The party was dwindling. Glystra thought back across
the last few weeks. A desperate bloody time. Ketch, Darrot,
Vallusser—killed. Cloyville had abandoned the trek. Abbigens,
Morwatz, the fifty Beaujolain soldiers— all killed. Heinzelman, the
Politburos, the Magickers in the griamobot—killed. A trail of death
speading behind like a wake . . . Who would be next?</p>
<p>  The thought hung in his mind like a cloud, while
they sailed along the bank of a quiet river—the East Fork of the
Thelma. The countryside was clumped with Earth-type oaks, cypress,
elm and hemlock, imported with the first settlers and now
well-adapted; Big Planet flora: bell-briar, mutus weed,
handkerchief trees, with flowers like strips of rag, bronzenbush,
wire-aspen, a hundred nameless varieties of low jointed furze.
Truck-farms and paddies occupied the river meadows; the caravan
passed neat rows of thistle and legumes, tended by a moon-faced
thick-necked people who paid them no heed whatever.</p>
<p>  The river presently bore to the north. The monoline
continued east, and the country changed. The green meadows and
forest became a dark blur to the left and behind; ahead was dry
savannah and a range of blue hills in the far Big Planet distance.
Clodleberg pointed. “The Eyrie.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  At noon on the third day Clodleberg pointed ahead
once more. “We’re coming to Lake Pellitante.” Glystra saw the sheen
of water, a limpidity in the sky that told of reflection from a
large sheet of calm warm water.</p>
<p>  The ground became marshy, and presently the
mono-line swung to the south. For half an hour they crossed dunes
sparsely overgrown with dry yellow grass, and the glare off the
white sands combined with the normal brilliance of the sunlight
made ordinary vision painful.</p>
<p>  A high dune passed below, the dry grass licking up
at the trolleys like spume at the crest of a wave, and they coasted
down toward a lagoon choked with brilliant yellow reeds.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg, riding fifty yards ahead, suddenly
dropped from sight. The yellow reeds boiled with life; naked men,
thin and tall as giraffes, painted in vertical yellow and black
stripes, sprang forth. They were immensely tall— eight feet or
more—and they came in great bounds. A sharp cry like a bugle-call
sounded; the men stopped short, stiffened back to heave spears . .
. Violet light fanned out, crackling with white sparks. The tall
men fell like rags. Three had not been killed, but lay thrashing
their long arms and legs like upturned insects.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg picked himself up from the ground,
stalked across the marsh, stabbed them with their own spears.</p>
<p>  The swamp was quiet. Nothing could be heard but a
rustle of the breeze in the reeds, the warm hum of insects. Glystra
looked at the power-bank of his ion-shine, shook his head. “Done
for.” He started to toss it to the ground, then remembered the
value of metal and tucked it under the seat.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg returned to his trolley, still muttering
and bristling. “The plague-taken reed-demons, they cut the line!”
Evidently, in Clodleberg’s register of evils, this was the most
depraved crime of all.</p>
<p>  “What race are these people?” asked Bishop, who had
clambered down one of the line standards to inspect the bodies.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg shrugged, and said in a disinterested
tone, “They call themselves the Stanezi . . . They’re a great
nuisance to travellers, since they gain nothing from the monoline
by way of trade.”</p>
<p>  Bishop nudged one of the scrawny forms over on its
back, peered into the open mouth. “Filed teeth. Hamitic physiognomy
... A Shilluk tribe emigrated to Big Planet from the Sudan about
four hundred years ago—an irredentist group who chose exile rather
than submission to World Government. Very possibly here are their
descendants.” He looked across the reeds, the dunes, the hot sheen
of Lake Pellitante. “The terrain is much like the one they
left.”</p>
<p>  “From the swamps of the Nile to the swamps of Lake
Pellitante,” apostrophized Pianza.</p>
<p>  From the tool-box in his trolley Clodleberg brought
a block-and-tackle, and under his direction the broken parts of the
monoline were heaved together. Sitting on top one of the standards
Clodleberg was able to sink barbed splints into both ends and
secure the splice with three whippings of fine cord. Then the
tackle was released and the monoline was once more whole.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg’s trolley was hoisted back up into
position; he set his sails and the caravan was once more under
way.</p>
<p>  As they rounded the elbow of the lagoon Glystra
looked back and saw crouching forms steal from the swamp toward the
yellow and black-striped bodies . . . What a tragedy, thought
Glystra. In ten seconds the flower of the tribe wiped out. There
would be wailing tonight in the Stanezi village, grovelling in the
ashes to the fetishes which had failed them, flagellations,
penances. . . .</p>
<p>  The monoline took a long gradual slant up into a
line of trees bordering Lake Pellitante, and the sudden shade was
like darkness. The wind was light, blowing in vagrant puffs, and
the trolleys ghosted hardly faster than a man could walk. The lake
lay nearly mirror-calm, with a peculiar yellow-gray glisten on the
surface, like a film of spider-web. The opposite shore was lost in
the haze; far out three or four boats were visible, manned,
according to Clodleberg, by fishermen of a tribe who held the land
in superstitious dread, and never in the course of their lives set
foot ashore.</p>
<p>  An hour later they passed a village of house-boats—a
triple row of barges floating a hundred yards offshore. The central
row was covered with vegetation, apparently a community kitchen
garden. There was an air of warmth and contentment to the village,
lazy days in the sunlight. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Late afternoon found the party still drifting
through the trees of the lake-shore, and at dusk a party of traders
appeared, riding the monoline from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg halted his trolley, the lead man in the
opposite caravan trundled cautiously closer, and the two exchanged
greetings.</p>
<p>  The traders were men of Miramar, in Coelanvilli, to
the south of Kirstendale, returning from Myrtlesee Fountain. They
were bright-eyed wiry men in white linen suits, wearing red
kerchiefs around their heads, which detail of dress invested them
with a peculiarly piratical air. Clodleberg, however, appeared to
be at his ease and Glystra gradually relaxed.</p>
<p>  The trade caravan consisted of fourteen freight
trolleys loaded with crystallized sugar. By an established rule,
the Earthmen, with only four trolleys, were obligated to drop to
the ground and allow the traders free-way.</p>
<p>  Evening had seeped lavender-gray across the lake,
and Glystra decided to camp for the night. The leader of the
traders likewise decided to make night camp.</p>
<p>  “These are sad times,” he told Glystra. “Every hand
is turned against the trader, and it is wise to band together as
many honest arms as possible.”</p>
<p>  Glystra mentioned the Stanezi ambush by the lagoon
of yellow reeds, and the trader laughed rather weakly.</p>
<p>  “The reed men are cowards; they are hardly
resourceful or persistent, and run at any loud sounds. It is
different on the Palari Desert, where two days ago we escaped the
Rebbirs only because a squall of wind drove us at great speed out
of danger.” He prodded the earth with a stick, looked uneasily to
the east. “They are keen as the Blackhelm panthers, as
single-minded as fate. It would surprise me not at all to find that
a party has followed us down the monoline. For this reason we have
kept our sleep short and our sentries double.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Treachery</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  It was still too early for sleep. The traders sat by
the fire, busy with a game involving a rotating cage full of
colored insects. Nancy sat cross-legged, her dark-fringed eyes
wide, the pupils big and black. Pianza sat on a log, paring his
fingernails; Bishop was frowning over a small notebook. Corbus
leaned back against a tree, his spare body relaxed, his eyes alert,
watchful. Clodleberg greased the bearings of the trolleys, humming
through his teeth.</p>
<p>  Glystra walked down to the shore, to watch evening
settle over the lake. Immense quiet enveloped the world, and the
faint sounds from the camp only pointed up the stillness. The west
was orange, green and gray; the east was washed in tenderest mauve.
The wind had died completely. The lake lay flat, with a surface
rich as milk.</p>
<p>  Glystra picked up a pebble, turned it over in his
fingers. “Round pebble, quartz—piece of Big Planet, washed by Big
Planet water, the water of Lake Pellitante, polished by the sands
of the Big Planet shore ...” He weighed it in his palm, half-minded
to preserve it. All his life it would have the power to recreate
for him this particular moment, when peace and solitude and
strangeness surrounded him, with Big Planet night about to
fall.</p>
<p>  Nancy drifted down from among the trees, her hair a
niist of pale gold. Thinking of the nights at Kirstendale Glystra
felt a pang, a pressure in his throat.</p>
<p>  She came close beside him. “Why did you come out
here?”</p>
<p>  “Just wandering . . . Thinking. ...”</p>
<p>  “Are you sorry you left Kirstendale?”</p>
<p>  He was surprised at the tone of wistful reproach.
“No, of course not.”</p>
<p>  “You have been avoiding me,” she said simply,
looking at him with wide eyes.</p>
<p>  Glystra had the uncomfortable feeling he was about
to be put on the defensive. “No, not at all.”</p>
<p>  “Perhaps you found the Kirstendale woman more
desirable than me?” Again the tone of sad accusation.</p>
<p>  Glystra laughed. “I hardly spoke to her . . . How
did you find the Kirstendale man?”</p>
<p>  She came close to him. “How could I think of anyone
other than you? My mind was full of jealousy. ...”</p>
<p>  The weight lifted from Glystra’s mind, the pressure
eased from his throat . . . High from the sky came the deep note of
a bell, a sonorous vibrating chime. Glystra looked up in
astonishment. “What on earth is that?”</p>
<p>  “Some kind of night-creature, I suppose.”</p>
<p>  The note throbbed once more across the lake, and
Glystra thought to see a dark shadow sweeping quietly past.</p>
<p>  He settled upon a log, pulled her down beside him.
“After Myrtlesee there’s no more monoline.”</p>
<p>  “No.”</p>
<p>  “I’ve been considering going back to
Kirstendale—”</p>
<p>  He felt her stiffen, turn her head.</p>
<p>  “—and there build a sail-plane large enough to carry
all of us. And then I remember that we can’t stay aloft
indefinitely; that without proper power to keep us going we might
as well stay on the ground . . . And then I consider fantastic
notions: rockets, kites—”</p>
<p>  She caressed his face. “You worry too much,
Claude.”</p>
<p>  “One scheme might work—a balloon. A hot-air balloon.
Unfortunately the trend of the. wind is south-east, and we would
very soon be blown out to sea.” He heaved a deep sigh.</p>
<p>  Nancy pulled him to his feet. “Let’s walk up the
shore, where we’re farther away from the camp. . . .”</p>
<p>  When they returned, the traders had brought out a
big green bottle of wine, and all were sitting around the fire,
flushed and talkative. Glystra and Nancy each drank a small
quantity, and presently the fire tumbled into coals and the night
air pinched at their bones.</p>
<p>  Sentry watches were arranged, and the party turned
into their blankets. Sleep, under the great trees by Lake
Pellitante. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Brilliant sunlight flooded the camp. Glystra
struggled awake. Why did his mouth taste so vilely? Why had not the
last sentry aroused him?</p>
<p>  He stared around the camp.</p>
<p>  The traders were gone!</p>
<p>  Glystra jumped to his feet. Under the monoline lay
Pianza, face down—and his neck was ghastly with blood.</p>
<p>  The trolleys were gone. Four trolleys, a hundred
pounds of metal, clothes, tools. . . .</p>
<p>  And Pianza dead . . .</p>
<p>  They buried him in a shallow grave in utter silence.
Glystra looked up and down the monoline, turned back to his
company.</p>
<p>  “There’s no use fooling ourselves. This is a real
blow.”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg said sheepishly, “The wine—we should
never have drunk the wine. They rubbed the inside of our glasses
with sleep oil. One should never trust traders.”</p>
<p>  Glystra shook his head glumly, looked toward
Pianza’s grave. No more Pianza. It was a real loss. A fine fellow,
kind, unassuming, cooperative. A wife and three children awaited
his return to Earth, but now they would never see him again. The
Earth calcium of his bones would settle into the Big Planet soil .
. . He returned back to the silent group.</p>
<p>  “Clodleberg, there’s no reason for you to come any
further. The trolleys are gone, our metal is gone. There’s nothing
for you ahead. You’d best get back to Kirstendale and pick up
Cloyville’s trolley, and that should get you back to Swamp
City.”</p>
<p>  There would be Corbus, Bishop, Nancy and himself
left in the party. “Any of you others can do likewise. There’s
hardship and death ahead of us. Anyone who wants to return to
Kirstendale—my good wishes go with him.”</p>
<p>  Nancy said, “Why won’t you turn back, Claude?
There’ll be all our life ahead of us—sooner or later we can get a
message to the Enclave.”</p>
<p>  “No. I’m going on.”</p>
<p>  “I’ll stick,” said Bishop.</p>
<p>  “I don’t like Kirstendale,” said Corbus. “They work
too hard.”</p>
<p>  Nancy’s shoulders drooped.</p>
<p>  “You can go back with Clodleberg,” suggested
Glystra.</p>
<p>  She looked up at him sorrowfully. “Do you want me
to?”</p>
<p>  “I never wanted you to come in the first place.”</p>
<p>  She tossed her head. “I’m not going back now.”</p>
<p>  Clodleberg rose to his feet, twisted his blond
mustache. He bowed politely. “I wish you all the best of luck.
You’d be wiser to return to Swamp City with me. Wittelhatch is not
the worst master in the world.” He looked from face to face.
“No?”</p>
<p>  “No.”</p>
<p>  “May you reach your destination.”</p>
<p>  Glystra watched him as he walked through the trees.
His arms swung free. He had left his cross-bow on the trolley; the
trolley was gone.</p>
<p>  “Just a minute,” called Glystra.</p>
<p>  Clodleberg turned inquiringly. Glystra gave him the
heat-gun. “This should see you past the Stanezi. Throw off the
safety here, press this button. There’s very little power left in
the bank, don’t fire it unless it’s absolutely necessary.”</p>
<p>  “Thank you,” said Clodleberg. “Thank you very
much.”</p>
<p>  “Goodbye.”</p>
<p>  They watched him disappear through the trees.</p>
<p>  Glystra sighed. “The two or three charges in that
gun might have taken us a few extra miles, or killed a few more
Rebbirs. It’ll save his life . . . Well, let’s take an inventory.
What’s left to us?”</p>
<p>  “The commissary packs, with the concentrated foods,
my vitamins, our blankets, the water-maker and four ion-shines,”
said Bishop. “Not very much.”</p>
<p>  “Makes for easier walking,” said Corbus. “Let’s get
moving. We’ll go crazy standing around here moping.”</p>
<p>  “Good enough,” said Glystra. “Let’s start.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The lake was forty miles wide—two days march under
the quiet trees. On the evening of the second day a river
out-flowing from the lake behind the south barred the way, and camp
was made on the shore.</p>
<p>  Next morning a raft was contrived by cross-piling
dead branches. By dint of furious poling and paddling the clumsy
construction was forced to the opposite bank, three miles
downstream from the monoline.</p>
<p>  Climbing up on the bank they looked across the
landscape. Looming in the north-east were the crags of the Eyrie,
guarded by a wall of great cliffs running north to south.</p>
<p>  “Looks like about another three days to the cliffs,”
said Bishop, “and no perceptible gap for the monoline.”</p>
<p>  “Perhaps it’s just as well we’re on foot,” said
Corbus. “Imagine the portage to the top of the cliff!”</p>
<p>  Glystra turned his head, looked along the river bank
toward the lake, looked again, squinted. He pointed. “What do you
see up there?”</p>
<p>  “About a dozen men on zipangotes,” said Corbus.</p>
<p>  “The traders spoke of a party of Rebbirs . . .
Conceivably—” he nodded.</p>
<p>  Nancy sighed. “How nice to ride on one of those
beasts instead of walking!”</p>
<p>  “The same thought had occurred to me,” said
Glystra.</p>
<p>  Bishop said dolefully, “Three months ago I was a
civilized human being, never thought I’d turn out a
horse-thief.”</p>
<p>  Glystra grinned. “Makes it less astonishing when you
remember that five or six hundred years ago the Rebbirs were
civilized Earthmen.”</p>
<p>  “Well,” said Corbus, “what do we do? Walk down and
murder them?”</p>
<p>  “If they’ll wait for us,” said Glystra. “I hope we
can do it on less than a macro-watt, because—” he scrutinized the
indicator of the ion-shine he had claimed from Pianza’s body
“—there’s only two macro-watts left in the bank.”</p>
<p>  “About the same here,” said Bishop.</p>
<p>  “I’ve got about two good kicks in mine,” said
Corbus.</p>
<p>  “If they ride off peaceably,” said Glystra, “we’ll
know they’re good citizens and their lives won’t be on our
consciences. But if—”</p>
<p>  “They’ve seen us!” cried Nancy. “They’re
coming!”</p>
<p>  It was a race across the stretch of gray plain—men
in flapping black cloaks crouched on the thundering zipan-gotes.
These were a species different from the string of beasts they had
sold to Wittelhatch; they were larger, heavier, and their heads
were bony and white, like skulls.</p>
<p>  “Demons!” muttered Nancy under her breath.</p>
<p>  The men wore tight helmets of a white shiny
substance, ridged over the tip and trailing scarlet plumes behind.
Crouched low, knees clamped into the horny black sides of their
skull-headed chargers, the foremost flourished swords of gleaming
metal.</p>
<p>  “Up here, up on the bank,” said Glystra. “We want to
delay the front ones till they’re all within range. ...”</p>
<p>  The horny feet thudded furiously across the plain,
the Rebbirs sang out calls of the wildest exultation. The faces of
the foremost were clear: bony aquiline visages, jut-nosed, the lips
drawn back in strain.</p>
<p>  “I count thirteen,” said Glystra. “Bishop take four
on the left; Corbus four on the right; I’ll get five from the
middle.”</p>
<p>  The riders deployed in a near-perfect line in front
of the outcrop where the four stood, as if they had lined up to be
killed. Three flickers of violet, a crackling of power. Thirteen
Rebbirs lay blasted and smouldering on the ground.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  A few minutes later they set off across the plain
toward the line of cliffs. They rode the four strongest zipangotes;
the others had been set free. The Rebbir swords, knives and metal
were secure behind their saddles. They wore black cloaks and white
helmets.</p>
<p>  Nancy found little pleasure in the disguise. “The
Rebbirs smell like goats.” She made a wry face. “This cloak is
abominable. And the helmet is greasy inside.”</p>
<p>  “Wipe it out,” advised Glystra. “If it gets us to
Myrtlesee, it’s served its purpose . . .”</p>
<p>  The land, rising in a long slope, became rocky and
barren. The flat-leaved vines and creepers near the lake gave way
to stunted thorns of a particularly ugly orange color. The tides of
sunlight glared and dazzled, and snow on the Eyrie glittered like
white fire.</p>
<p>  The region was not without inhabitants. From time to
time Glystra, glancing to the side, found white eyes in a pink
wizened face staring into his from out of the thorn, and
occasionally he saw them running, crouched low, bounding over the
rocks.</p>
<p>  On the morning of the second day a caravan of six
freight-carriers appeared in the distance ahead, sailing swiftly
down the wind. From a covert fifty yards off the trail the four
travellers watched the caravan whirl past— six swift shapes
swinging to the press of white cloth— then they were gone downwind,
and soon out of sight toward Lake Pellitante.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  On the third day, the escarpment loomed big ahead.
The monoline rose in a tremendous swoop, up toward the lip of the
cliff.</p>
<p>  “That’s the way you come down from Myrtlesee,” said
Glystra. He turned his head, followed the hang of the cable across
the sky, up, up, and along, till it disappeared against the chalky
front of the cliff. “Going up wouldn’t be so easy. That’s a long
portage. But down . . . Remember the ride down into the
Galatudanian Valley?”</p>
<p>  Nancy shivered. “This would be worse. ...”</p>
<p>  They came to the landing at the end of the monoline,
where the portage must start. The trail led off to the left,
slanting up over the basal detritus of crumbled boulders. Then it
cut back, into a way dug out of the very side of the cliff and
curbed with cemented masonry. Two hundred yards in one direction,
then back, traversing— right, left, right, left—and the shoulders
of the zipangotes rubbed the inner wall, so that it was necessary
to sit with the inside leg looped over the pommel of the saddle.
The zipangotes swept up the trail easily, gliding on six legs with
no suggestion of effort.</p>
<p>  Up, up, back, forth. The face of Big Planet dropped
below, spreading wider and wider, and where an Earthly eye might
expect a horizon, with a division into land and sky, there was only
land, and then still more land. Lake Pellitante glanced and gleamed
in the distance. A feeder river came down from the north, circling
out of the Eyrie, and stained the earth yellow with its swamps. The
outlet river, which they had crossed on rafts, swept broadly
south-east, presently breaking into a series of exaggerated
meanders, like a crumpled silver ribbon, and then vanished into the
south.</p>
<p>  Up, up. Wind drove a scud of clouds at the cliff;
suddenly the trail was cloaked in damp gray twilight, and the wind
swept up the mountain with the sound of a roaring torrent.</p>
<p>  The fog glowed yellow, dispersed in trails and
wisps; the sun shone full on their backs. Glystra’s beast shoved
its horny face over the last hump, surged with its four hind feet,
and stood on flat ground.</p>
<p>  They halted near the edge of the cliff, with the
wind pressing up over the rim. The plateau was bare limestone,
scoured and free of dust. Gray-white, featureless, it stretched
twenty miles flat as a sheet of cardboard; then became mottled, a
region of gray shadows. The intervening area was empty except for
the monoline: the standards at fifty-foot intervals and the cable
dwindling to nothing like an exercise in perspective.</p>
<p>  “Well,” said Glystra, “nothing in sight, so—”</p>
<p>  “Look,” said Corbus in a flat voice. He pointed
north, along the rim of the cliff.</p>
<p>  Glystra slumped back into the saddle. “Rebbirs.”</p>
<p>  They came along the verge like a column of ants,
still several miles distant. Glystra estimated their number at two
hundred. In a thick voice he said, “We’d better get moving . . . We
can’t kill them all. If we ride along the monoline—not too
fast—perhaps they won’t bother us. . . .”</p>
<p>  “Let’s go!” said Corbus.</p>
<p>  At a careless lope the caravan started east, down
the copy-book perspective of the monoline. Glystra kept an anxious
watch on the company to the north. “They don’t seem to be
following—”</p>
<p>  “They’re coming now,” said Corbus.</p>
<p>  A dozen of the cavalry spurted forward out of the
ranks, raced out at a slant evidently bent on interception.</p>
<p>  Glystra clenched his teeth. “We’ve got to run for
it.”</p>
<p>  He dug his knees into the side of the zipangote. It
moaned and mumbled and flung itself ahead, bony face straining
against the wind.</p>
<p>  Twenty-four heavy feet pounded back the limestone.
And behind came the Rebbirs, black cloaks flapping out behind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>The Rebbirs</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Nightmare flight, thought Glystra; was he asleep?
Nightmare steeds, nightmare riders, the gray-white flat given depth
only by the diminishing monoline: a nightmare vista permeated by
fear and strangeness and pitilessness. . . .</p>
<p>  He broke free of the sensation, cast it away.
Turning, he watched the Rebbirs over his shoulder. The whole army
had streamed out, as if stimulated by the excitement of the chase.
The first dozen had not gained appreciably; Glystra stroked the
horny side of his mount with an emotion almost like affection. “Go
to it, boy. . . .”</p>
<p>  Miles, changeless miles: flat gray plains, thunder
of pounding feet. Looking ahead, Glystra saw that they were near
the region of mottled shadows—dunes of sand, white as salt,
crystalline and bright as broken glass.</p>
<p>  The Rebbirs had drawn closer, apparently able to
extract the most frantic efforts from their mounts. Ahead—the
dunes: sand swept off the flatland and piled in huge rounded
domes.</p>
<p>  Looking behind, Glystra saw a sight which thrilled
him, one which might have been beautiful in other, less personal
circumstances. The Rebbirs in the van had risen to their feet,
standing in wonderful balance on the backs of their plunging
mounts. And each, throwing back his cloak, fitted an arrow to a
heavy black bow.</p>
<p>  The bows bent; behind the arrows Glystra glimpsed
keen faces: eagle cast to nose, forehead, chin. A chilling
wonderful sight ... He yelled, “Duck! They’re shooting at us!” And
he crouched over the side of his beast.</p>
<p>  <em>Thwinggg</em>! The shaft sang over his head. The
dunes towered above. Glystra felt the feet of his mount sound with
a softer thud, a scuffing, and they were coursing across white sand
. . . The creature was laboring, breath was seizing in its throat.
Very few miles left in the clogged muscles, then they would be at
bay, the four of them. Their ion-shines would kill ten, fifteen,
twenty, fifty— then there would be a sudden surge of hawk-faced
men, a raising of swords, a chopping. . . .</p>
<p>  Over the dunes, down the soft round valleys, up to
the milk-white crests. Then looking back to view the surge of
black-cloaked riders pouring across the swells, like black
surf.</p>
<p>  The dunes ended, washed against black obsidian
hills. Behind, the rumble of multitudinous feet, hoarse war-calls .
. . Out of the dunes, into an old water-course through the flint,
where possibly once or twice yearly water foamed. The zipangotes
stumbled over chunks of fractured black volcanic glass with sagging
necks, bent legs.</p>
<p>  To either side gullies draining the side areas
opened. Glystra swerved to the left. “In here!” He was panting, in
sympathy with the gasps of the zipangotes. “Quick! If we can lose
them, we’ve got a chance. ...”</p>
<p>  He plunged into the gully; behind came Nancy, pale,
white around the mouth, then Bishop, then Corbus.</p>
<p>  “Quiet,” said Glystra. “Back into the shadows—” He
held his breath as if he could control the rattling sobs of his
beast.</p>
<p>  Thudding sounded out in the main watercourse. Black
things hurled past the opening. War-calls sounded now loud, now
dim.</p>
<p>  There was a sudden slackening to the sounds, an
ominous change of pitch. Galls vibrated back and forth— questioning
tones, answers. Glystra turned, looking behind. The ravine sloped
at a near-impossible angle up to a ridge.</p>
<p>  Glystra beckoned to Nancy. “Start up the hill.” To
Bishop and Corbus: “After her.”</p>
<p>  Nancy kneed her mount. It moved, mumbled, stopped
short at the slope, lowered its skull, tried to turn.</p>
<p>  Nancy hauled the reins, kneed the beast desperately.
Coughing and whimpering, it set its first pair of feet above its
head on the slope, scrambled up.</p>
<p>  “Quick!” said Glystra in a harsh whisper. “They’ll
be here any minute!”</p>
<p>  Bishop and Corbus followed . . . The yelling sounded
closer. Glystra turned his mount up the slope. Steps sounded behind
him, a snuffling. Silence. Then a cry loud and brilliant, the
loudest sound Glystra had ever heard. From all directions came
answering calls.</p>
<p>  Glystra kneed his mount up the slope. Behind came
the Rebbir, leaning forward with his sword out-stretched, waving it
like an eager antenna.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The gully was choked with hot-eyed men and their
horny black beasts. The steep slope was a mass of clawing legs,
hulking shoulders.</p>
<p>  Nancy breasted over the ridge, then Bishop, then
Corbus, then Glystra.</p>
<p>  Corbus knew what to do. He laughed, his white teeth
shining. His ion-shine was ready. He aimed it at the first Rebbir
zipangote, squeezed. The white skull-head shattered into a scarlet
crush. The beast threw up its front legs like a praying mantis,
poised briefly, swung gradually over backwards, fell into the
beasts behind.</p>
<p>  A tangle of writhing flesh. White skull-faces,
despairing eagle-men, a horrid tangle at the bottom of the slope—a
talus of hot jerking flesh, the horny bodies of the zipangotes, the
softer sinews of men, clotted together like hiving bees.</p>
<p>  Glystra whirled his mount, led the way along the
ridge. They rode with all the speed left to their beasts, threading
the line of the ridge past the incursions of gullies, ravines,
gulches. Caves and blow-holes opened under their feet.</p>
<p>  After five minutes Glystra turned down one of the
gullies, halted behind a heavy wall of vitreous slag.</p>
<p>  “They’ll be a long time finding us now, if they even
bother to look . . . We’ll be safe until dark, at any rate.”</p>
<p>  He looked down at the heaving shoulders of his
mount. “You’re not much of a looker—but you’ve been quite a friend.
. . .”</p>
<p>  After nightfall they returned to the ridge and stole
eastward through the dark. The ridge crumbled into rotten gray
rock, disappeared under a dim ocean of sand.</p>
<p>  As they started across the flat, from far behind
came a call, an eerie hooting which might or might not have been
human. Glystra halted his zipangote, looked up toward the Big
Planet constellations, listened. Silence everywhere.</p>
<p>  The zipangote shuffled its feet, snorted softly. The
distant call came once more. Glystra shifted in his saddle, kneed
the zipangote into motion. “We’d better put distance between us and
the Rebbirs while it’s still dark. Or at least until we find
concealment of some sort.”</p>
<p>  They set off quietly across the glimmering sand.
Glystra watched over his shoulder. A spatter of meteorites
scratched bright lines down the sky. From far back came the
mournful call once more.</p>
<p>  Big Planet rolled on through space, twisting its
shoulder back toward Phaedra. Dawn came, a pink and orange
explosion. By this time the zipangotes were barely able to stumble
and their heads swung on long necks, sometimes striking the
ground.</p>
<p>  The light grew stronger. A silhouette, low in the
east, appeared—vegetation, waving fronds, bearded stalks, tendrils
trailing from splayed branches.</p>
<p>  Phaedra burst up into the sky. Plain to be seen now
was an island of vegetation ten miles long in a white sea. From the
center rose a hemispherical dome, glistening as of pale metal.</p>
<p>  “That must be Myrtlesee,” said Glystra. “Myrtlesee
Fountain.”</p>
<p>  There was no area of transition. Desert became oasis
as sharply as if a knife had trimmed away any extraneous straggles
of herbage. Blue moss grew fresh and damp; an inch away the clay
lay as dry and arid as any twenty miles to the west.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Passing into the cool gloom was like entering the
Garden of Paradise. The air smelled of a hundred floral and leafy
essences, damp earth, pungent bark. Glystra slid off his mount,
tied the reins to a root, helped Nancy to the ground. Her face was
pinched and white, Bishop’s long countenance was loose and waxy,
Cx&amp;gt;rbus’ eyes gleamed like moonstones and his mouth was
pulled into a thin pale line.</p>
<p>  The zipangotes nosed and snuffled in the moss, lay
down, rolled over. Glystra ran to remove the packs before they
should be crushed.</p>
<p>  Nancy lay at full length in the shade, Bishop
slumped beside her.</p>
<p>  “Hungry?” asked Glystra.</p>
<p>  Nancy shook her head. “Just tired. It’s so peaceful
here. And quiet . . . Listen! Isn’t that a bird singing?”</p>
<p>  Glystra listened, and said, “It sounds very much
like a bird.” A shadow crossed his face; he frowned, shook his
head. He dismissed the odd idea which had suddenly been inserted in
his mind. And yet—hmm. Strange.</p>
<p>  Corbus opened the commissary pack, mixed vitamin
concentrate with food powder, moistened it, stirred it into a heavy
paste, scraped it into Cloyville’s cooker, squeezed down the lid,
waited an instant, lifted the lid and withdrew a cake of hot
pastry. He contemplated it gloomily. “If we ever get back to Earth
I’m going to eat for a month. Ice cream, steak, apple pie, swiss
cheese on rye with lots of mustard, strawberry shortcake, corned
beef and cabbage, fried chicken, spare-ribs—”</p>
<p>  “Stop it,” groaned Bishop. “I’m sick as it is.
...”</p>
<p>  Glystra lay down on the moss. “Let’s hold a council
of war.”</p>
<p>  Corbus asked lazily. “What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked up into the blue-green foliage,
tracing the white veins of a leaf. “Survival . . . There were eight
of us that left Jubilith, not counting Nancy. You, Bishop, me,
Pianza, Ketch, Darrot, Cloyville and Vallusser. Nancy makes nine.
We’ve come a thousand miles and there’s only four of us left. Ahead
of us is first of all more desert, the main part of the Palari.
Then mountains, then the lake and the Monchevior River, then God
knows what-all.”</p>
<p>  “Trying to scare us?”</p>
<p>  Glystra continued as if he hadn’t heard. “When we
left Jubilith, I thought the chances pretty good that we’d all make
it. Footsore, bedraggled—but alive. I was wrong. We’ve lost five
men. Our weapons are just about done for. I don’t know whether I’ve
got a charge left in mine or not. Big Planet is meaner and tougher
than we allowed for. The chances are that we’ll be killed if we go
on. So— now’s the time. Anyone who wants to return to Kirstendale
on the monoline has my blessing. There’s metal enough in those
Rebbir swords to make us all rich men. If any of you feel that
you’d rather be a live Kirster than a dead Earthman—now’s the
chance to make up your minds, and no hard feelings.“</p>
<p>  He waited. No one spoke.</p>
<p>  Glystra still looked up into the leaves. “We’ll rest
here in Myrtlesee a day or so, and then—whoever wants to start
east—” He left the sentence hanging in mid-air. His eyelids were
heavy. The warm air, the cool shade, the soft moss, fatigue—all
induced drowsiness. He aroused himself with a jerk. Bishop was
snoring. Nancy was lying on her side. Corbus sat with his back to a
tree, eyes half-closed.</p>
<p>  Glystra rose to his feet. “Looks like we’re planning
to sleep,” he said to Corbus. “I’ll take first look-out. You can
have the second, then Bishop, then Nancy. . . .”</p>
<p>  Corbus nodded, stretched out full length.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Glystra paced up and down, clenching and unclenching
his hands. It was as if his brain were a house and knocking on the
door was a boy with a barrowful of thoughts. Somehow he could not
find the key to the door.</p>
<p>  He walked softly across the moss, looked down at his
companions. Bishop snored, Corbus slept like an innocent child,
Nancy’s hands trembled, quivered as if in a nightmare. He thought:
the traders had killed Pianza, the man on watch, why had they
stopped? It would have been perfectly safe to kill the entire
party, and the traders apparently lacked qualms of any sort. The
Earthmen wore valuable clothes, with many metal accessories. The
ion-shines alone represented fortune beyond dreams. Why had not the
entire party been slaughtered in their sleep? Was it that the
traders had been prevented by someone who carried enough authority,
perhaps in the shape of an ion-shine, to enforce his decisions?</p>
<p>  Glystra kneaded his knuckles in his palms . . . Why?
Had his enemy calculated that without trolleys, they might turn
back to Kirstendale? If Pianza had been killed while someone stood
acquiescently by, one of these three sleeping before him was not
only a spy and a saboteur, but a murderer.</p>
<p>  Glystra turned away, the ache of grief and
uncertainty in his throat. He walked back into the grove. The moss
was like a deep rug of marvellous softness. The air was murmurous,
restful. Big Planet sunlight trickled through layers of leaves and
open spaces, fell around him with the richness of light in a
fairy-tale forest. Through the air came a sweet trilling,
soft-flute-like. The song of a bird— no, probably an insect or a
lizard; there were no birds on Big Planet. And from the direction
of the dome he heard the mellow chime of a gong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  There was a soft sound beside him. He jerked around.
It was Nancy. He sighed in relief. “You frightened me.”</p>
<p>  “Claude,” she whispered, “let’s go back—all of us.”
She went on breathlessly, “I have no right to talk this way, I’m an
uninvited guest . . . But—you’ll surely die, I don’t want you to
die . . . Why can’t we live, you and I? If we returned to
Kirstendale—we could live out our lives in quiet. . . .“</p>
<p>  He shook his head. “Don’t tempt me, Nancy. I can’t
go back. But I think that you should.”</p>
<p>  She drew away, searched his face with wide blue
eyes. “You don’t want me any more?”</p>
<p>  He laughed wearily. “Of course I do. I need you
desperately. But—it’s a miracle that we’ve come this far. Our luck
can’t hold out forever.”</p>
<p>  “Of course not!” she cried. “That’s why I want you
to turn back!” She put her hands on his chest. “Claude, won’t you
give up?”</p>
<p>  “No.”</p>
<p>  Tears trickled down her cheeks. He stood awkwardly,
trying to formulate words of comfort. They stuck in his throat.
Finally, for want of anything better, he said, “You’d better rest,”
aware that the words sounded stiff and formal.</p>
<p>  “I’ll never rest again.”</p>
<p>  He looked at her questioningly. But she went to the
verge of the oasis, leaned against a tree and stood looking across
the white desert.</p>
<p>  Glystra turned away, paced up and down the cool blue
moss.</p>
<p>  An hour passed.</p>
<p>  He walked down to look at Nancy. She lay
outstretched, head on her arms, asleep. Something in her posture,
in the stiff turning-away of the back, intimated to Glystra that
never again would their relationship be quite the same.</p>
<p>  He went to where Corbus lay asleep, touched his
shoulder. Corbus’ eyes flicked open instantly.</p>
<p>  “Your watch. Call Bishop in an hour.”</p>
<p>  Corbus yawned, rose to his feet. “Right.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  A sound. Hoarse throbbing sound. Glystra was very
tired, very comfortable.</p>
<p>  A harsh yammering penetrated the world behind his
eyelids. It was a distant urgent sound. Danger, he must awake.
<em>He must awake</em>!</p>
<p>  He jumped to his feet, wide awake, clawing at his
ion-shine.</p>
<p>  Corbus lay beside him, asleep.</p>
<p>  Bishop was nowhere in sight. Neither was Nancy.</p>
<p>  A crackle of harsh voices. A thud. Another thud.
Further voices, dying, fading out.</p>
<p>  Glystra ran through the foliage, through vines with
heart-shaped leaves, through a clump of red feather-bushes with
green flowers. He tripped on a body, stopped short, frozen in
terror.</p>
<p>  The body was headless. Blood still pumped from the
stump. The head was nowhere visible. The body belonged to Bishop’s
head.</p>
<p>  <em>Where was that round head with its brain so full
of knowledge? Where was Bishop, where had he gone?</em></p>
<p>  He felt a grasp of his arm. “Claude!” He felt a
string on his cheek. He looked into Corbus’ face.</p>
<p>  “They’ve killed Bishop.”</p>
<p>  “So I see. Where’s Nancy?”</p>
<p>  “Where’s Nancy? <em>Where’s Nancy</em>?”</p>
<p>  He turned to look, then halted his gaze, turned to
look at the ground at his feet.</p>
<p>  “Whoever killed Bishop took her with him,” said
Corbus. “Looks like her tracks, here in the moss—”</p>
<p>  Glystra took a deep breath, another. He looked down
at the tracks. Sudden energy fired him. He ran off toward the dome.
He passed a circle of slim cypresses, branches laden with golden
fruit. He came out on a paved walk, leading straight to the great
central dome. The whole face of the building was visible as well as
the columned arcades to either side. Neither Nancy nor her captors
were in sight.</p>
<p>  For an instant Glystra stood stock still, then
started forward once again. He ran through the gardens, past a long
marble bench, a fountain spraying up six jets of clear water, down
a walkway paved with diamond-shaped blocks of white and blue-gray
stone.</p>
<p>  An old man in a gray wool smock looked up from where
he knelt with a trowel in flower-bed.</p>
<p>  Glystra stopped, demanded harshly, “Where did they
go? The men with the girl?”</p>
<p>  The old man gazed blankly at him.</p>
<p>  Glystra took a short step forward; the old man
cringed.</p>
<p>  “Where did they go? Answer me, or—”</p>
<p>  Corbus came up behind. “He’s deaf.”</p>
<p>  Glystra glared, swung away. A door opened into a
wall at the end of the walkway; this was the door Nancy must have
been taken through. He ran over, tried it. It was as solid as a
section of the stone wall.</p>
<p>  He pounded on it, yelling, “Open up! Open!
Open!”</p>
<p>  Corbus said, “Pounding on that door won’t get you
much but a knife in your neck.”</p>
<p>  Glystra stood back, stared at the stone building.
The sunlight had lost its tingle, the gardens were drab and dismal.
In a bitter voice he said, “There’s nowhere on this planet where a
man can walk in peace.”</p>
<p>  Corbus shrugged. “I guess anything goes anywhere— so
long as they can get away with it.”</p>
<p>  Glystra clenched his teeth; the muscles corded
around his mouth. “There’s power in this gun to kill a lot of them,
and by heaven, I’ll see the color of their blood!”</p>
<p>  Corbus’ voice was tinged with impatience. “We’ll do
better if we go at the matter rationally. First we’d better take
care of our beasts before they’re stolen.”</p>
<p>  Glystra glared defiantly up at the stone wall, then
turned away. “Very well . . . You’re right.”</p>
<p>  For a moment they stood by the headless body. “Poor
old Bishop,” said Glystra.</p>
<p>  “We probably won’t outlive him more than a day,”
said Corbus in his flat voice.</p>
<p>  The zipangotes stood grunting and growling, bumping
the white carapace of their heads against the tree-trunks.
Wordlessly Glystra and Corbus loaded the packs, handling the
pathetic belongings of Bishop and Nancy with heavy fingers.</p>
<p>  Corbus stopped in his work. “If I was running this
outfit, do you know what we’d do?”</p>
<p>  “What?”</p>
<p>  “We’d ride out of here due east as fast as we could
make it.”</p>
<p>  Glystra shook his head. “I can’t do it, Corbus.”</p>
<p>  “There’s something fishy going on.”</p>
<p>  “I know it. I’ve got to make sure what it is. I’m
fighting a lost cause now . . . You can still drift back to
Kirstendale.”</p>
<p>  Corbus grunted.</p>
<p>  They climbed into the saddles, rode toward the
dome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>The Search</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The air was full of lazy sounds: the far bird-like
trill, a hum of small insects, the rustle of warm wind. They passed
a clump of gardenia trees; here stood a girl playing with a
diabolo. She had a triangle face, big dark eyes; she wore green
satin trousers and red slippers. Wordlessly she watched them pass,
mouth a little parted, her toy forgotten, and contemplating her
shining cleanliness Glystra became warmly aware of his own
bristling filth.</p>
<p>  They rode out of range of the girl’s curious eyes,
past a low wall topped with spheres of polished stone overgrown
with colored lichen. Behind came the sound of soft singing. The
wall merged into the side of the main dome; skirting the building
they rode down a neat lane. A ditch with clean water flowed to the
left; to the right was a line of small shops. It was a bazaar like
hundreds of others Glystra had passed through while travelling
among the stars.</p>
<p>  Rugs, shawls, quilts hung over rods; fruits and
melons lay heaped in neat pyramids; pottery crocks and vessels lay
stacked, their glaze misted by a film of dust; baskets hung from
ropes. No one heeded them as they rode past on the moaning
zipangotes. In the shadows a few heads were turned and Glystra saw
the flash of eyes, but there were no voices raised to greet or
sell.</p>
<p>  One shop, slightly larger than the others, displayed
a wooden sword as a guild-mark. Glystra pulled up his mount. “I’ve
got an idea.” He slid free a pair of the swords they had taken from
the Rebbirs, carried them into the dimness of the shop.</p>
<p>  A short fat man leaning against a heavy table looked
up. He had a big pale head, black hair shingled with gray, a sharp
nose and chin, the face of a Rebbir changed and rendered devious by
civilization.</p>
<p>  Glystra flung the swords down on the table. “What
are these worth to you?”</p>
<p>  The fat man looked at them and his face changed. He
did not try to conceal his interest. “Where did you get these?” He
reached out, gingerly felt the metal. “These are the finest steel .
. . None but the South Rebbir hetman carry steel like this.”</p>
<p>  “I’ll part with them cheap,” said Glystra.</p>
<p>  The armourer looked up with quick light in his eye.
“What is your wish? A sack of peraldines? A four-tier helmet,
mother-of-pearl perhaps, crowned by a Magic Mountain opal?”</p>
<p>  “No,” said Glystra. “It’s easier than that. An hour
ago my woman was taken into the big dome, or temple, whatever you
call it. I want her back.”</p>
<p>  “Two steel swords for a woman?” demanded the
merchant incredulously. “Do you joke? I’ll furnish you fourteen
virgins beautiful as the morning sun for the two swords.”</p>
<p>  “No,” said Glystra. “I want this particular
woman.”</p>
<p>  The merchant absent-mindedly felt of his neck,
stared into the shadow of his shop. “In truth, I covet the swords .
. . And yet I own but one head.” He stroked the shiny metal with a
reverent hand. “Still—each of these blades represents a thousand
heads—a thousand bits of iron, melted and annealed, cleared of
dross, heated and quenched, honed for half a year.” He picked up
one of the swords. “The Dongmen are unpredictable; at times they
seem foolish and old, and then one hears of their craft and
cruelty, so that an honest man never knows what to believe. . .
.”</p>
<p>  Glystra fidgeted. Time was passing; minutes kneaded
dull fingers into his mind. Nancy—his mind wavered sidewise into
the possibilities. Thenfa floor of hardness seemed to rise up under
his misgivings. Suppose she were bedded, raped; if that were the
worst, there was no irreparable harm done. . . .Possibly she might
be allowed a respite. One hour, two hours? Perhaps bathed,
perfumed, clothed? It all depended upon the fastidiousness of her
captor.</p>
<p>  He became aware of the merchant’s calculation.
“Well?”</p>
<p>  “Just exactly what do you want of me?”</p>
<p>  “I want this woman. She is young and beautiful. I
imagine she has been taken to someone’s private chamber.”</p>
<p>  With an expression of surprise at his ignorance, the
merchant shook his head. “The priests are celibate. Only the
hierarchs allowed themselves the use of women. More likely she has
been taken to the pens.”</p>
<p>  “I know nothing of the temple,” said Glystra. “I
want the help of someone who does.”</p>
<p>  The merchant nodded. “I see. You want help. You’ll
risk your own head then?”</p>
<p>  “Yes,” said Glystra angrily, “but drop the idea that
you won’t be risking yours along with me.”</p>
<p>  “I won’t,” said the merchant coolly. “But there is
one who will.” He pushed with his foot under the counter. A moment
later a chunky young man with a face harder and bonier than his
father’s entered the room. His eyes fell on the swords; he uttered
a sharp exclamation, took a step forward, halted, looked at
Glystra.</p>
<p>  “My son Nymaster,” said the merchant. He turned to
the young man. “One of the blades is yours. First you must take
this man through Nello’s crevice into the temple. Wear robes, take
an extra robe with you. This man will point out a woman he wants;
no doubt she’ll be in the pens. You will bribe Koromutin. Promise
him a porphyry dagger. Bring the woman back outside.”</p>
<p>  “Is that the all of it?”</p>
<p>  “That’s everything.”</p>
<p>  “Then the blade is mine?”</p>
<p>  “The blade is yours.”</p>
<p>  Nymaster turned, motioned to Glystra with an air of
calm execution. “Come.”</p>
<p>  “One moment,” said Glystra. He went to the door.
“Corbus.”</p>
<p>  Corbus slouched into the room, looked around
expressionlessly.</p>
<p>  Glystra pointed to the two blades. “If I return with
Nancy, this man receives the two swords. If neither of us
returns—kill him.”</p>
<p>  The merchant voiced an inarticulate protest. Glystra
glared at him, “Do you think I trust you?”</p>
<p>  “Trust?” said the merchant with a puzzled
expression. “Trust? What word is that?” And he tested it several
times more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Glystra gave Corbus a wolfish grin. “If I don’t see
you again—good luck. Set yourself up as an emperor somewhere.”</p>
<p>  The merchant conferred earnestly with his son,
gesticulating with the palm of one hand. The son wore a subdued
expression.</p>
<p>  Nymaster beckoned to Glystra; they left the shop,
walked around the building, entered an alley between two fences
over which fern fronds fell. Nymaster stopped at a little shed. He
pressed heavily on one foot, the door swung open. He reached in,
tossed a bundle to Glystra. “Wear this.”</p>
<p>  It was a white gown with a tall peaked hood. Glystra
pulled it over his head. “Now this,” said Nymaster—a maroon
sleeveless smock an inch shorter than the first garment. “And
this”—a loose gown of black still shorter, with a second hood.</p>
<p>  Nymaster dressed himself similarly. “It’s the wear
of a Dongman Ordinary—a lay priest. Once inside the temple no one
will look at us.” He tied a third set of robes into a neat bundle,
looked up and down the alley. “This way— quickly,”</p>
<p>  They ran a hundred feet to a portal in the fence,
passed through into a rank garden of fern. The ground was marshy
and quivered underfoot. The ferns crackled and snapped in the
wind.</p>
<p>  Nymaster halted, then stole forward carefully,
stopped once more, held out a hand admonishing silence. Looking
past him, through a screen of wire vine, Glystra saw a tall spindly
man with a gray concave face and a crooked nose standing idly in
the sunlight. He carried a quirt in a long gnarled hand, which he
slapped idly against his black boots. A little distance away six
children of varying ages squatted in a truck garden, grubbing weeds
with sharp sticks. Their ankles were knotted together with greasy
twine, their only garment was a loose smock of coarse cloth.</p>
<p>  Nymaster leaned back, whispered, “To reach the wall
we’ve got to pass Nello; we can’t let him see us, he will raise an
outcry.”</p>
<p>  He bent, picked up a clod, flung it hard at the
little boy at the end of the line. The boy cried out, then quickly
silenced himself, bent furtively to his work.</p>
<p>  Nello uncoiled like a lazy python, sauntered yawning
across the sunny garden to the quivering boy and raising his whip,
carefully and without haste striped the child’s buttocks.
Once—twice—three times—</p>
<p>  Nymaster pulled at Glystra’s arms. “Now while he’s
absorbed in his enjoyment. ...”</p>
<p>  Glystra let himself be pulled across the patch of
open space, behind a wall of crumbling stone. Nymaster scurried now
at top speed, the skirts of his garment flapping in three-colored
flashes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  By a thick cycad with a trunk like the skin of a
pineapple he paused, looked in all directions, and finally peered
through the fronds at the top of Myrtlesee dome.</p>
<p>  “Sometimes a priest stands in the turret watching
across the desert. This is when they expect important guests, and
wish to ready the oracle.” He peered, squinted. “Hah, there he is,
scanning the wide world.”</p>
<p>  Glystra saw the dark shape in a cage atop the dome,
standing stiff as a gargoyle.</p>
<p>  “No matter,” said Nymaster. “He will never notice
us; his gaze is out in the air-layers.” He climbed the wall, using
chinks and crevices in the rock for foot and hand holds. Halfway up
he disappeared from view, and Glystra, following him up the wall,
came upon a narrow gap invisible from below.</p>
<p>  Nymaster’s voice came from below. “The wall was
built for show, and hollow. There is an avenue within.”</p>
<p>  Glystra heard a clink, a click and sparks flew
through the darkness. A line of hot smoulder pulsed as Nymaster
blew, burst into a tongue of flame, from which he lit a torch.</p>
<p>  Nymaster strode ahead confidently, a lord in his own
realm. They walked a hundred yards, two hundred yards, across damp
well-packed clay. Then the wall ended against blank stone. At their
feet was a pit into which Nymaster lowered himself.</p>
<p>  “Careful,” he muttered. “The footholds are only cut
into clay. Get a good toe-grip.”</p>
<p>  Glystra descended eight feet, ducked under the
foundations of a heavy wall, crawled up a slanting passage.</p>
<p>  “Now,” said Nymaster, “we’re under the floor of the
Main College. Over there”—he pointed—“is the Veridicarium, where
the oracle sits.”</p>
<p>  Footfalls sounded above—hasty yet light, with an odd
hesitancy. Nymaster cocked his head. “That’s the Sacristy, old
Caper. When he was young a malicious slave poisoned her teeth, and
when he made demands on her, she bit his thigh. The wound never
healed and his leg is no thicker than a wand.”</p>
<p>  A second mass of rock barred their way. Nymaster
said, “This is the oracle’s pedestal. Now we must be careful. Hold
your head away from the light, say nothing. If we are halted and
recognized—”</p>
<p>  “What then?”</p>
<p>  “It depends on who the villain is, and his rank. The
most dangerous are the novices in black fringes, who are
over-zealous, and the Hierarchs, with gold baubles on their hoods.
The ordinaries are less conscientious.”</p>
<p>  “What do you plan?”</p>
<p>  “This passage leads to the pens where prisoners,
slaves and exchanges are pent before processing.”</p>
<p>  “Processing? Do you mean serving as an oracle?”</p>
<p>  Nymaster shook his head. “By no means. The oracle
needs the wisdom of four men to guide his thoughts, and for every
dissertation of an oracle three men besides himself must be
processed. He himself serves as fourth man, for the next
oracle.”</p>
<p>  Glystra, gripped by a sudden impatience, waved his
hand. “Let’s hurry.”</p>
<p>  “Now—absolute quiet,” warned Nymaster. He led around
the rock, up a rude wooden ladder, from which he rolled off on to a
shelf. He fixed the torch in a rope socket, and crawled off on his
stomach through the darkness. Glystra came after. Overhead a stone
floor pressed into his back.</p>
<p>  Nymaster stopped and Glystra ran into his feet.
Nymaster listened, then jerked forward.</p>
<p>  “Follow me, swiftly.”</p>
<p>  He disappeared. Glystra almost fell into a dim hole.
He swung himself down, stood on a stone floor at Nymaster’s back.
Vile-smelling water gurgled past his feet. Nymaster strode toward
the light, a shaft of feeble yellow shining down a flight of steps.
He climbed the steps and without hesitation stepped out into the
light.</p>
<p>  Glystra followed.</p>
<p>  The air was hot and reeked with an oily stench that
knotted his stomach. From a wide archway came sounds of
industry.</p>
<p>  Nymaster marched past without pause. Glystra
followed on his heels. He turned his head, looked into a bin—into
the blank dead eyes of Bishop.</p>
<p>  Glystra made a moaning coughing sound, stopped
short. He felt Nymaster’s hard arm, heard his petulant voice.</p>
<p>  “What’s the trouble?”</p>
<p>  “That is the head of my friend.”</p>
<p>  “Ah.” Nymaster was uninterested. “Beyond is the
extraction room where the head is tapped of its wisdom. . . .It is
a precise art, so I am given to understand, and not easily
mastered.” He looked sardonically at Glystra. “Well—?”</p>
<p>  Glystra pushed himself away from the wall. “Yes.
Let’s get it over with.”</p>
<p>  By a heroic effort he restrained his gorge. Nymaster
impatiently hurried off down the corridor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Men in robes passed—two, three, four—without paying
them heed. Then Nymaster stopped short. “There, behind this wall
are the pens. Look in through the chinks and pick out your
woman.”</p>
<p>  Glystra pressed close to the stone wall, peered
through an irregular hole at about eye-level. A dozen men and
women, completely naked, stood in the middle of the room, or sat
limply on stone benches. Their hair had been shaved, and their
pates daubed with paint of either blue, green or yellow.</p>
<p>  “Well—which one is she?” snapped Nymaster. “That one
at the far end?” This was a long-headed creature with pendant
breasts and a yellow wrinkled belly.</p>
<p>  “No,” said Glystra. “She’s not here.”</p>
<p>  “Ha,” muttered Nymaster. “Hm, this poses a problem .
. . Very difficult—and I fear past the scope of our agreement.“</p>
<p>  “Nonsense!” said Glystra in a deadly voice. “The
agreement was to find the woman and bring her out, wherever she was
... So now take me to her, or I’ll kill you here and now.”</p>
<p>  “I don’t know where to look for her,” explained
Nymas-ter in a patient voice.</p>
<p>  “Find out then!”</p>
<p>  Nymaster frowned. “I’ll ask Koromutin. Wait
here—”</p>
<p>  “No. I’ll come with you.”</p>
<p>  Nymaster growled under his breath, and turned off
down the passage. He thrust his head into a little chamber. The man
within was fat and middle-aged. He wore a spotless white tunic and
an immaculate collar of ruffled lace. He appeared soft, pompous,
petulant, effeminate, capable of irresponsible spite. He was not
surprised to see Nymaster and resentful only to the extent that as
an important official, his time was valuable.</p>
<p>  Nymaster spoke to him in a low voice, which Glystra
bent forward to hear. Koromutin’s eyes rested on him, probed under
his hood.</p>
<p>  “—he says she’s not in the pen; he won’t leave till
he finds her. She must own the key to his life; she must be a
witch. No woman is worth such effort and expense. But in any event
we must have her.”</p>
<p>  Koromutin frowned judiciously. “This woman evidently
must be pent upstairs for personal use. If so—well, how much does
your father put forward? Now I mind me of a certain dagger of good
Philemon porphyry. . . .”</p>
<p>  Nymaster nodded. “It shall be yours.”</p>
<p>  Koromutin rubbed his hands, bounded to his feet,
examined Glystra with a new speculation. “The woman is evidently a
rich queen. My dear sir,” he bowed, “I salute your loyalty. Allow
me to assist your search.” He turned, not waiting for Glystra’s
answer, flounced down the hall.</p>
<p>  They climbed a flight of curving stairs. From above
came the sound of footsteps descending. Koromutin bowed with vast
obsequiousness.</p>
<p>  “Bow!” hissed Nymaster. “The Prefect Superior!”</p>
<p>  Glystra bowed low. He saw the hem of priestly robes,
exceedingly rich. The white was a silky floss; the red, a fur soft
as the pelt of a mole; the black, a heavier fur. A peevish voice
said, “Where are you, Koromutin? An oraculation will shortly be in
progress, and where is the wisdom? You are remiss.”</p>
<p>  Koromutin spoke resonant apologies. The Prefect
Superior returned upstairs. Koromutin trotted back to his cubicle,
where he donned a high-collared garment of stiff white brocade
embroidered with scarlet spiders and a tall white conical hat with
ear flaps and cheek guards which almost hid his face.</p>
<p>  “Why the delay?” hissed Glystra.</p>
<p>  Nymaster shrugged. “Old Koromutin holds the post of
Inculcator, and that is his ceremonial regalia. We will be
delayed.”</p>
<p>  Glystra said fretfully, “We have no time for it;
let’s get about our business.”</p>
<p>  Nymaster shook his head. “Not possible. Koromutin is
bound to the oraculation. In any event, I wish to witness the rite;
never have I watched an oracle at his revelations.”</p>
<p>  Glystra growled threats but Nymaster could not be
moved. “Wait till Koromutin leads us to the woman. She is not in
the pens, you saw as much yourself.”</p>
<p>  Glystra, fuming and disquieted, was forced to be
content.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>The Oracle</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Koromutin continued his preparations. From a locked
cabinet he brought a jar of a murky yellow fluid, from which he
filled a rude hypodermic.</p>
<p>  “What’s that stuff?” demanded Glystra
contemptuously.</p>
<p>  “That is wisdom.” Koromutin spoke with unctuous
complacency. “The head glands of four men go into each charge; the
material is concentrated sagacity.”</p>
<p>  Hormones, pineal fluid, thought Glystra; God only
knew what nastiness.</p>
<p>  Koromutin replaced the jar of fluid in the cabinet,
clamped the hypodermic to the front of his hat like a holy emblem.
“Now—to the Veridicarium.”</p>
<p>  He led Nymaster and Glystra down the corridor, up
the stairs, along a wide passage to the central hall under the
dome—a large twelve-sided room panelled with mother-of-pearl and
swimming with pale gray color. In the center rose a dais of black
wood holding a single chair.</p>
<p>  There were only two dozen priests in the hall,
arranged in a semi-circle, chanting a litany of monosyllabic
gibberish unintelligible to Glystra, and, he suspected, equally
meaningless to the priests.</p>
<p>  “Only a score,” muttered Koromutin. “The Lord
Voiv-ode will not be pleased. He bases the value of the oracle’s
wisdom by the number of priests in the hall ... I must wait here,
in the alcove.” His voice came muffled as if from under the robes.
“By custom, I follow the oracle.” He glanced around the hall. “You
two had best go by the Boreal Wall, lest some stripling novice peer
under your hood and raise an outcry.”</p>
<p>  Nymaster and Glystra took inconspicuous positions
against a great carved screen. A moment later an egg-shaped
palanquin curtained with peach satin and fringed with blue tassels
was borne into the hall. Four black men in red breeches served as
porters; two girls followed with a chair of withe and clever pink
bladder cushions.</p>
<p>  The porters set down the equipage; a red-faced
little man hopped out from between the curtains, seated himself in
the chair which was hurriedly thrust under him.</p>
<p>  He beckoned furiously, to no one in particular, to
the world at large. “Haste, haste!” he wheezed. “Life is running
out! The light leaves my eyes while I sit here!”</p>
<p>  The Prefect Superior approached him, bowed his head
with nicely calculated respect. “Perhaps the Lord Voivode would
care to refresh himself during the preliminary rites.”</p>
<p>  “Devil take the preliminaries!” bawled the Voivode.
“In any event I note but a niggardly score of priests here to honor
my presence; such makeshift preliminaries I can well spare. Let us
to the oraculating; this time let him be a stalwart in his prime—a
Rebbir, a Bode, a Juillard. No more like that senile Delta-man who
died two minutes after the spasms left him.”</p>
<p>  The prefect bowed. “We will seek to oblige you,
Voivode.” He looked up at a sound. “The oracle comes.”</p>
<p>  Two priests entered the room supporting between them
a black-haired man in a white smock. He stared back and forth like
a trapped animal, digging his heels into the floor.</p>
<p>  The Lord Voivode roared in contempt. “Is this the
creature who is to advise me? Faugh! He appears unable to do more
than empty his bowels in fear!”</p>
<p>  The prefect spoke with imperturbable suavity. “Let
your misgivings vanish, Lord Voivode. He speaks with the wisdom of
four men.”</p>
<p>  The wretch in the white smock was hoisted to the
chair on the dais, where he sat trembling.</p>
<p>  The Lord Voivode watched in ill-concealed disgust.
“I believe I can tell him more than he can tell me, even with his
wisdom quadrupled; all he knows is fear. And once again the
precious instants of my life are wasted futilely; where will I find
just treatment?”</p>
<p>  The prefect shrugged. “The world is wide; perhaps
somewhere oracles exist superior to ours here at Myrtlesee
Fountain. The Lord Voivode might with advantage put his questions
to one of those other omniscients.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode spluttered, abruptly lapsed into
silence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Now appeared Koromutin, stately and ceremonious in
his stiff gown. He climbed the dais, lifted the hypodermic down
from his hat, plunged it home in the oracle’s neck. The oracle
tensed, arched his back like a bow, flung his elbows out, thrust
his chin hard into the air. For a moment he sat rigid, then
slumped, limp as seaweed into the chair. He put his head into his
hand, rubbing his forehead.</p>
<p>  There was dead silence in the chamber. The oracle
rubbed his forehead.</p>
<p>  His foot jerked. His head bobbed. Sounds came from
his mouth. He raised his head in bewilderment. His shoulders
quivered, his feet jerked again, his nose twitched. A swift babble
poured from his mouth, rising in pitch. He yelled, in a hoarse
bawling voice. His body quivered, jerked—faster, faster. He was
vibrating as if the dais were rocking.</p>
<p>  Glystra watched with fascinated eyes. “Is that the
wisdom? I find no sense in this screaming.”</p>
<p>  “Quiet.”</p>
<p>  The man was in wildest agony. Moisture dripped from
his mouth, his face muscles were knotted into ropes, his eyes
glared like lamps.</p>
<p>  The Lord Voivode leaned forward, smiling and
nodding. He turned to the prefect who bent respectfully, put a
query inaudible over the yammer of the oracle. The prefect nodded
calmly, straightened, teetered back and forth on his heels, hands
behind his back.</p>
<p>  The oracle sprang to his feet. His back arched, the
breath rattled past lips which were pulled back from teeth . . .
Then he settled limply into the chair. He sat still, calm and
serene, as if agony had purged away all the dross in his soul and
left him with a vast meditative coolness.</p>
<p>  In the silence the prefect’s murmur to the Voivode
was clearly distinguishable: “He’s now on the settle. You have
perhaps five minutes of wisdom before he dies.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode hitched himself forward. “Oracle, answer
well, how long have I to live?”</p>
<p>  The oracle smiled wearily. “You ask triviality—and I
shall answer. Why not? So—from the position of your body, from your
gait, from certain mental considerations, it is evident that you
are eaten by an internal canker. Your breath reeks of decay. I
judge your life at a year, no more.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode turned a contorted face to the prefect.
“Take him away; he is a liar! I pay good slaves and then he tells
me lies. . . .”</p>
<p>  The prefect held up a calm hand. “Never come to
Myrtlesee Fountain for flattery or bolus, Voivode; you will hear
only truth.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode turned back to the oracle. “How may I
extend my life?”</p>
<p>  “I have no certain knowledge. A reasonable regimen
would include bland foods, abstinence from stimulating narcotics
and gland revitalizers, a program of charitable deeds to ease your
mind.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode twisted angrily back to the prefect.
“You have gulled me; this creature voids the most odious nonsense.
Why does he not reveal the formula?”</p>
<p>  “What formula?” inquired the prefect without
concern.</p>
<p>  “The mixing of the elixir of eternal life!” roared
the Voivode. “What else?”</p>
<p>  The prefect shrugged. “Ask him yourself.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode dictated the question. The oracle
listened politely.</p>
<p>  “There is no such information in my experience, and
insufficient data to synthesize such a formula.”</p>
<p>  In more gentle tones the prefect suggested, “Ask
only such information as lies in the realm of the natural. The
oracle is no seer, like the Witthorns or the Edelweiss Hags.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode’s face turned a mottled purple. “How may
I best secure my son his inheritance?”</p>
<p>  “In a state isolated from external influence a ruler
can rule from tradition, by force or by the desire and acquiescence
of his subjects. The last of these guarantees the most stable
reign.”</p>
<p>  “Go on, go on!” screamed the Voivode. “Time fleets:
You will die at any moment?”</p>
<p>  “Strange,” said the oracle with a weary smile, “when
now for the first time I have started to live.”</p>
<p>  “Speak!” said the prefect sharply.</p>
<p>  “Your dynasty started with yourself when you
poisoned the previous voivode; there is no tradition of rule. Your
son might therefore maintain himself by force. The process is
simple. He must kill all who dispute his leadership. These acts
will win him new enemies, and he must kill these likewise. If he is
able to kill faster than his enemies are able to gather their
strength, he will remain in power.”</p>
<p>  “Impossible! My son is a popinjay. I am surrounded
by traitors, preening cock-o’-the-walk underlings who wait the time
of my death as the signal to rob and pillage.”</p>
<p>  “In this case your son must prove himself a ruler so
able that no one will desire to be rid of him.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode’s eyes grew dim. His gaze went far away,
perhaps to the face of his son.</p>
<p>  “To foster this situation, you must institute a
change in your own policies. Examine every act of your officials
from the viewpoint of the least privileged members of the state,
and modify your policies accordingly; then when you die, your son
will be floated on a reservoir of good will and loyalty.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode leaned back in his chair, looked
quizzically up at the prefect. “And it is for this that I have paid
twenty sound slaves and five ounces of copper?”</p>
<p>  The prefect was disturbed. “He has outlined a course
of action to guide you. He has answered your questions.”</p>
<p>  “But,” the Voivode protested, “he told me nothing
pleasant!”</p>
<p>  The prefect looked blandly up along the
mother-of-pearl panelling. “At Myrtlesee Fountain you will hear no
flattery, no spurious evasions. You hear exactitude and truth.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode swelled, puffed, blew out his
cheeks.</p>
<p>  “Very well, another question. The Delta-men have
been raiding all Cridgin Valley and stealing cattle. My soldiers
flounder in the mud and reeds. How best may I abate this nuisance?
What can I do?”</p>
<p>  “Plant bush-vine on the Imsidiption Hills.”</p>
<p>  The Voivode sputtered; the prefect said hastily,
“Explain if you please.”</p>
<p>  “The Delta-folk subsist by preference on clams. For
centuries they have cultivated clam beds. You have grazed your
pechavies on the Imsidiption slopes so steadily that the vegetation
is gone and the rain washes great quantities of silt into River
Pannasic. This silt is deposited on the clam beds, the clams die.
In hunger the Delta-men raid the cattle of the valley. To abate the
nuisance, remove the cause.”</p>
<p>  “They have been impudent and treacherous; I want
revenge.”</p>
<p>  “You will never achieve your wish,” the oracle
said.</p>
<p>  The Voivode leapt to his feet. He seized a stone jar
from his palanquin, threw it viciously at the oracle, struck him on
the chest. The prefect held up an outraged hand; the Voivode darted
him a look of black malice, flung aside the girls, jumped into the
palanquin. The four black porters silently lifted the poles to
their shoulders, started for the door.</p>
<p>  The oracle had closed his eyes. His mouth drooped. A
tic twisted his lips. He began to gasp—great gulping breaths. His
fingers clenched, unclenched. Glystra, watching in fascination,
started forward, but Nymaster clutched him, drew him back.</p>
<p>  “Are you mad? Do you not value your head?”</p>
<p>  Koromutin marched past, motioned significantly.
“Await me in the corridor.”</p>
<p>  “Hurry!” said Glystra.</p>
<p>  Koromutin gave him a glance of wordless contempt,
disappeared down the passage. An endless ten minutes later he
returned, wearing his usual white and blue robe. Without a word or
glance he turned up the steps glowing with vermilion lacquer, which
gave on an arcade circling the dome. Through tall arches Glystra
could see across the oasis, past the shimmer of the desert to the
black hills, now hazy in the afternoon light.</p>
<p>  Koromutin turned up another flight of stairs, and
they came out into another corridor circling the dome. This time
the openings overlooked the hall below. Koromutin turned into a
small office. A man almost his twin sat at a desk. Koromutin waved
Nymaster and Glystra back, approached the desk, spoke with great
earnestness, and presently received an answer of equal import.</p>
<p>  Koromutin beckoned to Nymaster. “This is Gentile,
the Steward Ordain. He can help us, if your father will part with a
second dagger of workmanship like that I am to receive.”</p>
<p>  Nymaster grumbled and cursed. “It can be so
arranged.”</p>
<p>  Koromutin nodded and the little man at the desk, as
if waiting the signal, arose, stepped out into the hall.</p>
<p>  “He has seen the woman in question,” said Koromutin
in a confidential undertone, “and can take you to her quarters. I
leave you in his care. Walk discreetly, for now you tread in high
places.”</p>
<p>  They continued, with Gentile the steward in the
lead— along interminable corridors, up another flight of stairs.
Glystra heard a sound which caused him to halt in his tracks—a
low-pitched steady hum.</p>
<p>  Gentile turned impatiently. “Come now, I will show
you the woman, then my task is done.”</p>
<p>  “What causes that sound?” asked Glystra.</p>
<p>  “Look through the grating; you will see the source.
It is a glass and metal organism that talks in distant voices—a
think of potency, but not of our present interest. Come.”</p>
<p>  Glystra peered through the grating. He saw modern
electronic equipment arranged and hooked together in a manner that
suggested knowledgeable improvisation. A rough table held a
speaker, a microphone, a bank of controls, and behind, the twenty
parallel fins which carried the printed circuits, served as
condensers, resistances, impedances . . . Glystra stared, the sight
opening an entirely new range of possibilities.</p>
<p>  “Come, come, come!” barked the steward. “I wish to
keep my head on my shoulders, even if you care nothing for
yours.”</p>
<p>  “How much further?” snapped Nymaster. The affair was
taking him farther afield than he had bargained for.</p>
<p>  “A few steps, no more, then you shall see the woman;
but mind you, take care not to make your presence known or else
we’ll all dangle and our heads will be drained.”</p>
<p>  “<em>What</em>!” barked Glystra savagely. Nymaster
gripped his arm, shook his head urgently. “Don’t antagonize the old
fool,” he whispered. “Otherwise we’ll never find her.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Charley Lysidder</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  They continued, walking on heavy green carpet along
a corridor which constantly curved out of sight ahead. At last
Gentile halted at a door of heavy wood. He looked furtively behind,
then stooped with the ease of much practice, peered through the
crack where the hinges dented the jamb.</p>
<p>  He turned, motioned to Glystra, “Come now, look.
Assure yourself of her presence—then we must leave. At any moment
the High Dain may appear.”</p>
<p>  Glystra, smiling grimly, looked through the
crack.</p>
<p>  Nancy. She sat in a cushioned chair, head back, eyes
half-closed. She wore loose pajamas of dull green brocade; her hair
was bright and clean, she looked as if she had only just finished
scrubbing herself. Her face was blank, expressionless; or rather,
she wore an expression Glystra could not identify.</p>
<p>  With his left hand Glystra felt for the latch of the
door. In his right hand he held his ion-shine. The fat steward
squawked. “Stand back, stand back! Now we must depart!” He plucked
Glystra’s sleeve with angry fingers.</p>
<p>  Glystra shoved him away. “Nymaster, take care of
this fool.”</p>
<p>  The door was not locked. He flung it open, stood
square in the doorway.</p>
<p>  Nancy looked up with wide eyes. “Claude. . . .”</p>
<p>  She slowly put her feet to the floor, stood up. She
did not rush to him in gladness and relief.</p>
<p>  “What’s the trouble?” he asked quietly. “What’s
happened to you?”</p>
<p>  “Nothing.” Her voice was listless. “I’m all
right.”</p>
<p>  “Let’s get moving. There’s not too much time.”</p>
<p>  He put an arm around her shoulders, urged her
forward. She seemed limp, dazed.</p>
<p>  Nymaster held the steward negligently by the nape of
the neck. Glystra looked deep into his frightened and outraged
countenance. “Back to the radio room.” The steward jerked around,
trotted whimpering back along the amber-lit corridor.</p>
<p>  Downstairs, back along vaguely remembered ways.
Glystra held his ion-shine in one hand, Nancy’s arm in the
other.</p>
<p>  A hum, an electric susurration.</p>
<p>  Glystra pushed into the room. A thin man in a blue
smock looked up. Glystra said, “Stand up, be quiet and you won’t
get hurt.”</p>
<p>  The operator slowly rose to his feet, his eyes on
Glystra’s ion-shine. He knew it for what it was. Glystra said.
“You’re an Earthman.”</p>
<p>  “That’s right. What of it?”</p>
<p>  “You set up this equipment?”</p>
<p>  The operator turned a contemptuous glance along the
table. “What there is of it ... Anything wrong with that? What’s
your argument?”</p>
<p>  “Get me Earth Enclave.”</p>
<p>  “No, sir. I won’t do it. I value my life pretty
high, mister. If you want Earth Enclave, call it yourself. I can’t
stop you with that heater on me.”</p>
<p>  Glystra took a sinister step forward, but the man’s
face changed not a flicker. “Stand against the wall, next to the
steward . . . Nancy!”</p>
<p>  “Yes, Claude?”</p>
<p>  “Come in here, stand over by the wall, out of the
way. Don’t move.”</p>
<p>  She walked slowly to where he had indicated. She was
trembling, her eyes roved around the room, up and down the
walls.</p>
<p>  She licked her lips, started to speak, thought
better of it.</p>
<p>  Glystra sat down at the table, looked over the
equipment. Power from a small pile—a simple short-wave outfit like
that owned by a million high school boys on Earth.</p>
<p>  He snapped the “On” switch. “What’s the Enclave
frequency?”</p>
<p>  “No idea.”</p>
<p>  Glystra opened a file index, flipped to E. “Earth
Enclave, Official Monitor—Code 181933.” The control panel displayed
six tuning knobs. Under the first was the symbol “0,” under the
second “10,” under the third, “100,” and so by multiples often to
the sixth. Evidently, thought Glystra, each knob tuned a decimal
place of the frequency. He set the sixth knob to “1,” the second to
“8”—he looked up, listened.</p>
<p>  Footsteps sounded along the wall, heavy hard feet,
and Nancy wailed, a wordless sound of desperation.</p>
<p>  “<em>Quiet</em>!” hissed Glystra. He bent to the
dials. “1”—“9”—</p>
<p>  The door swung open. A heavy black-browed face
looked in. Instantly the steward was on his belly. “Holy Dain, it
was never my will, none of my doing. . . .”</p>
<p>  Mercodion looked over his shoulder into the
corridor. “Inside. Seize those men.”</p>
<p>  Glystra bent to the dials. “3”—one more dial to go.
Burly men trooped into the room; Nancy staggered out from the wall,
her face drawn and bloodless. She stood in the line of fire.
“Nancy!” cried Glystra. “<em>Get back</em>!” He aimed his
ion-shine. She stood between him and the High Dain. “I’m sorry,”
whispered Glystra huskily. “It’s bigger than your life. . . .”</p>
<p>  He squeezed the button. Violet light, ghastly on
white faces. A sigh. The light flickered, went out. No power.</p>
<p>  Three men in black robes rushed him. He fought, wild
and savage as any Rebbir. The table tottered, toppled. In spite of
the operator’s frantic efforts the equipment crashed, jangled to
the floor. At this point Nymaster bolted from the room. His feet
pounded down the corridor.</p>
<p>  Glystra was fighting from the corner, using elbows,
fists, knees. The black-robed men beat him to the floor, kicked his
head, wrenched his arms up hard behind his back, punishing him.</p>
<p>  “Truss him well,” said Mercodion. “Take him down to
the pen.”</p>
<p>  They marched him along the corridors, down the
stairs, along the arcade overlooking the oasis.</p>
<p>  A black speck streaked low across the sky. Glystra
uttered a hoarse cry. “There’s an air-car! An Earthman!”</p>
<p>  He stopped, tried to pull close to the window. “An
Earth air-car!”</p>
<p>  “An Earth air-car,” said Mercodion easily, “but not
from Earth. From Grosgarth.”</p>
<p>  “Grosgarth?” Glystra’s mind worked sluggishly. “Only
one man in Grosgarth would own an air-car—”</p>
<p>  “Exactly.”</p>
<p>  “Does the Bajarnum know—”</p>
<p>  “The Bajarnum knows you’re here. Do you think he
owns an air-car and no radio?”</p>
<p>  He said to the black-robed men, “Take him to the
pens, I must greet Charley Lysidder . . . Watch him carefully, he’s
desperate.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Glystra stood in the middle of the stone floor,
naked, damp, miserable. His clothes had been stripped from him, his
head was shaved, he had been drenched in an acrid fluid smelling of
vinegar.</p>
<p>  These were the pens of Myrtlesee Fountain. The air
was gruel-thick with latrine reek and slaughter-house odors,
seeping in with the steam from the processing rooms. Glystra
breathed through his mouth to escape awareness of the stink.
Horrible odor—but it was a poor time to be fastidious. He frowned.
Strange. A component of the stench was a heavy, pungent, almost
sweet, smell which tickled his memory.</p>
<p>  He stood quietly, trying to think. Difficult. The
stone floor oozed under his bare feet. Four old women crouching
beside the wall moaned without pause. A thin red-eyed man vilified
a blowsy woman with waist-long blonde hair, which for some reason
had not been shaved. She sobbed into her hands, without apparent
attention to the curses of the man—guttural throat-catching sobs.
Steam and stench poured in from the processing room through chinks
and cracks in the stone, likewise bars of yellow light flickering
through the steam. With the light and the steam came the sounds of
the processing: boiling, pounding, rasping, loud conversation.</p>
<p>  Eyes looked in at him, through the hole to the
corridor, blinked, passed on ... Unreality. Why was he here? He was
waiting to have his head boiled. Like Bishop’s head. Pianza was
lucky; he lay buried beside the yellow reeds of Lake Pellitante.
Cloyville was luckier yet. Cloyville wore a grotesque puff of
purple lace on his head, and played at being both master and
servant.</p>
<p>  This was the low ebb. Nearly the low ebb. Much of a
man’s dignity went with his hair. There was one more notch to
slip—from naked humiliation into the anonymous soup of the
processing pots. It was almost foreordained, this last notch. It
had been a steady progress down a slope toward lesser and lesser
life, morale, power ... A whiff of the pungent sweet odor came from
the processing rooms, stronger than ever. It was definitely
familiar. Lemon-verbena? Musk? Hair-oil? No. Something clicked in
Glystra’s mind. <em>Zygage</em>! He went to the wall, peered
through a chink.</p>
<p>  Almost under his face a tray held four neatly
arranged heads, with their brain-pans sawed off to display the
mottled contents.</p>
<p>  Glystra twisted away his gaze. To the right a
cauldron bubbled; to the left a bin held acorn-shaped fruits.
Zygage, indeed. He watched in fascination. A man, sweating and
pallid, in clammy black leather breeches and a blue neckerchief,
scooped up a shovel-full of the zygage acorns, sprinkled them into
the cauldron.</p>
<p>  Zygage! Glystra turned away from the hole, thinking
hard. If zygage were a constituent for the oracle-serum, why, then,
the brain-extracts? Probably no reason whatever; probably they were
added only for their symbolic potency. Of course he could not be
sure—but it seemed unlikely that pituitary and pineal soup would
cause wild contortions like those he had witnessed in the
Veridicarium. Much more likely that the zygage was the active
ingredient; such would be the parallel with Earth plant-extracts:
marijuana, curare, opium, pejote, a dozen others less familiar.</p>
<p>  He thought of his own experience with zygage:
exhilaration, then hangover. The oracle’s reaction was the same, on
a vastly exaggerated scale. Glystra pondered the episode. A
miserable terrified wretch had undergone torment and catharsis to
achieve a magnificent calm and rationality.</p>
<p>  It had been an amazing transformation, baring the
optimum personality apparently latent in every human being. How did
the drug act? Glystra’s mind veered around the question: a problem
for the scientists. It seemed to achieve the results of the great
de-aberration institutes on Earth, possibly by the same essential
methods: a churning through the events of a lifetime, the rejection
of all subconscious obsessions and irrationality. A pity, thought
Glystra, that a man only achieves this supreme state to die. It was
like the hang-over after his smoke-breathing ... In his brain there
was a sudden silence, as if a mental clock had stopped ticking.
Bishop had felt no hangover. Bishop had—he recalled Bishop’s
intensified well-being after the zygage inhalation; apparently his
habit of ingesting vitamins had warded off the hangover.</p>
<p>  Vitamins . . . Perhaps the oracle died from
exaggerated vitamin depletion. And the idea gave Glystra much to
think about. He walked slowly back and forth across the damp stone
floor.</p>
<p>  The woman with the yellow hair watched him dully;
the red-eyed man spat.</p>
<p>  “<em>Ssst</em>.”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked toward the wall. Hostile eyes gleamed
through the hole. He crossed the room, peered out into the
corridor.</p>
<p>  It was Nymaster. His tough round face wore an
expression of angry discomfort. “Now you lie in the pen,” he said
in a low urgent voice. “So now you die. What then for my father?
Your man will take away the swords, and possibly kill my father,
for so you ordered.”</p>
<p>  True, thought Glystra. Nymaster had served him
faithfully. “Bring me paper,” he said. “I will write to
Corbus.”</p>
<p>  Nymaster handed through a greasy scrap of paper, a
bit of sharp graphite.</p>
<p>  Glystra hesitated. “Have you heard anything of—”</p>
<p>  “Koromutin says you will be oracle. For Charley
Lys-idder himself. So the prefect told him while he was beating
Koromutin.”</p>
<p>  Glystra pondered. “Can you bribe me free? I have
other metal, other swords like yours.”</p>
<p>  Nymaster shook his head. “A ton of iron would effect
nothing now. Tonight Mercodion has ordained that you burn up your
mind for the Bajarnum.”</p>
<p>  The words sank into Glystra’s mind. He stared at
Nymaster scratching his cheek with a ruminative finger. “Can you
bring Corbus back with you? For another sword of fine steel?”</p>
<p>  “Aye,” said Nymaster grudgingly. “I can do so ... A
mortal risk—but I can do so.”</p>
<p>  “Then take him this note, and bring him back with
you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Now the sounds and the stenches of the pen had no
meaning for him. He paced up and down, whistling thinly through his
teeth.</p>
<p>  Up, down, up, down, looking across the room at each
turn, watching for Corbus’ face.</p>
<p>  A chilly thought struck him. He had guessed
something of the mechanics of the plot against him. After Morwatz
had failed, after he had eluded the second expedition by crossing
the river Oust and dropping the high-line, he had been left to go
his own way to Myrtlesee, but all the time, all the weary miles
from Swamp City, he had merely been taking himself to a prearranged
trap. The strategy was clear. He had been left to execute it
himself. Suppose Corbus was part of the machinery? At this moment
nothing was unthinkable.</p>
<p>  “Glystra.”</p>
<p>  He looked up, turned to the hole. It was Corbus in
priest’s robes. Glystra glanced right and left, crossed the
room.</p>
<p>  Corbus looked in at him quizzically. “How goes
it?”</p>
<p>  Glystra pressed close to the hole. “Did you bring
it?” he asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>  Corbus passed a little package through the hole.
“And now what?”</p>
<p>  Glystra smiled thinly. “I don’t know. If I were you
I’d start back down the monoline to Kirstendale. You can’t do any
more here.”</p>
<p>  Corbus said, “You haven’t told me what you plan to
do with the vitamins.”</p>
<p>  “I plan to eat them.”</p>
<p>  Corbus eyed him questioningly. “They been giving you
bum chow?”</p>
<p>  “No. Just an idea I’ve got.”</p>
<p>  Corbus glanced up and down the corridor. “With a big
hammer I might make a hole in this wall—”</p>
<p>  “No. There’d be a hundred priests out here at the
first click. You go back to the sword-maker’s, wait till tomorrow.
If I’m not there then I’m never coming.”</p>
<p>  Corbus said coolly, “There’s one or two charges in
the ion-shine. I’ve been half-hoping”—his eyes glistened— “to meet
someone we know.”</p>
<p>  Glystra’s throat constricted. “I can’t believe it,”
he muttered.</p>
<p>  Corbus said nothing.</p>
<p>  “She never had Bishop killed, I’m sure of it ... It
was an accident. Or he tried to stop her.”</p>
<p>  “No matter how you look at it—she’s part of the
picture. Four good men killed—Bishop, Pianza, Darrot, Ketch. I’m
not counting Vallusser; that little rat was in up to his neck. I’ve
been watching her a long time—ever since she insisted on joining
our little suicide club.”</p>
<p>  Glystra laughed shortly. “I thought all the time it
was—that she—” he had no words to finish.</p>
<p>  Corbus nodded. “I know. One thing I’ll say for her,
she put her life on the line alongside ours. She came out on top.
She’s up there”—he jerked his thumb—“and you’re down here. What a
stinking hole. What are they cooking?”</p>
<p>  “Brains,” said Glystra indifferently. “They distil
out some kind of nerve juice which they mix with zygage and feed
the oracles. It works on the oracles like the smoke worked on the
Beaujolain soldiers, only a thousand times more.”</p>
<p>  “And it kills them?”</p>
<p>  “Dead as a mackerel.”</p>
<p>  “Tonight you’re the oracle.”</p>
<p>  Glystra held up the package Corbus had brought him.
“I’ve got this. I don’t know what’s going to happen. From here out
I’m playing strictly by ear. And,” he added, “I may be wrong, but I
have a hunch there’ll be a few unforeseen developments here at
Myrtlesee Fountain and I’m not worrying.“</p>
<p>  Nymaster appeared behind Corbus. “Come, there’s a
prefect on his way down. Come quick.”</p>
<p>  Glystra pressed close to the hole. “So long,
Corbus.”</p>
<p>  Corbus waved his hand non-committally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Wisdom for Lysidder</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The sun dropped behind the fronds of Myrtlesee
Fountain. A mesh of cirrus clouds flared golden in the sky. Dusk
drifted in from eastern lands where night had already fallen over
peoples and cities and tribes and castles still unseen.</p>
<p>  A marble pavilion extended to the east of Myrtlesee
Dome, enclosed by a colonnade of ornate design. Behind the
colonnade was a pond of still water, dimly reflecting the afterglow
with the fronds and ferns of the grove silhouetted in reverse. Four
blond and slender youths bearing torches came from the dome. Their
hair was cut in effeminate bangs. They wore skin-tight costumes
sewed of red and green diamonds, black satin slippers with curled
toes. They set the torches in tripods of dark wood, returned
within.</p>
<p>  A moment later six men in black kilts carried forth
a square table which they placed in the exact center of the
pavilion. The blond boys brought chairs, and the men in black kilts
marched away in a single file.</p>
<p>  The boys spread the table with a gold and
brown-striped cloth, giggling like girls. At the center they
arranged a miniature landscape—Myrtlesee Fountain in exact detail,
complete with dome and pavilion, even to a table on the pavilion,
where five persons sat to the light of tiny candles.</p>
<p>  Flagons of liquor and wine were bedded in ice, trays
of crystallized fruits, tablets of insect gland-wax, cakes of
pressed flower petals were laid exactly in place, then the boys
went to pose under the flaming torches, consciously beautiful.</p>
<p>  Minutes passed. The boys fidgeted. Dusk gave way to
feather-soft Big Planet night. Stars gleamed. A syrup-smooth breeze
drifted through the colonnade to flutter the torches.</p>
<p>  Voices sounded from the dome. Out on the pavilion
came Mercodion, the High Dain of Myrtlesee Fountain and Charley
Lysidder, Bajarnum of Beaujolais. Mercodion wore his richest robes,
with a stole woven of pearls and metal. The Bajarnum wore a gray
jacket of heavy soft cloth, red breeches, soft gray boots.</p>
<p>  Behind came the Prefect Superior and two nobles of
the Beaujolais empire.</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder remarked with pleasure at the
table, glanced appreciatively at the statue-like youths, seated
himself.</p>
<p>  Wine was poured, food was served. Charley Lysidder
was in high spirits and Mercodion extended himself to laugh
graciously at his jovialities. Whenever there was silence a girl
blew chords on a flute. When one of the diners spoke, she stopped
instantly.</p>
<p>  Ices and sorbets were brought in glass goblets, and
finally pots of fuming incense were placed before each of the
diners.</p>
<p>  “Now,” said the Bajarnum, “now for our oracle,
Claude Glystra. Originally I had planned to question him under
torture, but the oraculation will prove easier for all concerned.
He is a man of wide experience and knowledge; he will have much to
impart.”</p>
<p>  “A pity that such brief opportunity exists to plumb
his wisdom.”</p>
<p>  The Barjarnum shook a finger. “It is a matter you
must concern yourself with, Mercodion—the maintenance of longer
life in your oracles.”</p>
<p>  The High Dain bowed his head. “It is as you say . .
. And now I will order the oracle prepared and we will go to the
auditorium.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The hall was crowded with the rustling black-gowned
priests. By custom hoods were not worn at night, but the
characteristic motivation of reducing individuality to the lowest
common denominator was expressed by a white head cloth banded
loosely around the forehead, around the nape of the neck, forward
under the chin.</p>
<p>  Special ceremonial chants had been ordained. Twelve
choirs situated each to a wall, mingled their voices in a
twelve-part polyphony.</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum, Mercodion and their retinue entered
the hall, strolled to benches before the oracle’s dais. A
serious-faced girl with shining blonde hair appeared at a side
door. She wore black silk pantaloons and a gray-green blouse. For a
moment she paused in the doorway, then slowly crossed the room, the
only woman among hundreds of men, a peacock among crows. Eyes
covertly followed her, tongues moistened celibate lips.</p>
<p>  She stopped beside the Bajarnum, looked down at him
with an oddly searching expression. Mercodion bowed politely. The
Bajarnum smiled a cold tremble-lipped smile. “Sit down.”</p>
<p>  The expression of intentness vanished, her face
became blank. She sat quietly beside the Bajarnum. A whisper, a
buzz, a rustle of garments rose from the spectators. By rumor the
woman was the new toy of the High Dain. Eyes curiously probed his
face, but the sallow skin was set like the rind of a pudding and no
emotion appeared.</p>
<p>  A sad chime sounded; a second tremor ran through the
hall, a shifting of stance, a motion of eyes. The Bajarnum suddenly
seemed to become aware of the assemblage; he muttered to the High
Dain, who nodded, rose to his feet.</p>
<p>  “Clear the hall. All must go.”</p>
<p>  Murmuring, dissatisfied, the priests filed out the
great doors. The hall was now near-empty, and reverberated with
echoes of every movement.</p>
<p>  A second chime sounded; the oracle appeared. Two
prefects stood by his side, the Inculcator in his stiff white gown
and tall hat followed close to the rear.</p>
<p>  The oracle was wrapped in a robe of gray and red,
and white swathing veiled his head. He walked slowly, but without
hesitation. At the dais he paused and was lifted to the oracle’s
seat.</p>
<p>  The silence in the hall was like the inside of an
ice-cave. Not a breath, not a sigh, not a whisper could be
heard.</p>
<p>  The prefects held the oracle’s arm, the Inculcator
stepped close behind. He took the hypodermic from his hat, he swung
his arm.</p>
<p>  The High Dain frowned, squinted, jumped to his feet.
“Stop!” His voice was harsh.</p>
<p>  The watchers sighed.</p>
<p>  “Yes, Dain?”</p>
<p>  “Remove the head-swathing; the Bajarnum would look
on the man’s face.”</p>
<p>  The prefect hesitated, then reached forward, slowly
unhitched the white burnoose.</p>
<p>  The oracle looked straight ahead, down into the eyes
of the Bajarnum. He smiled grimly. “If it isn’t my old shipmate,
Arthur Hidders, dealer in leather.”</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum made a slight inclination of the head.
“More people know me as Charley Lysidder.” He examined Glystra with
a narrow scrutiny. “You appear nervous, Mr Glystra.”</p>
<p>  Glystra laughed, rather shakily. Enormous overdoses
of vitamins, amino and nucleic acids were reacting on his motor
system like stimulants. “You do me an honor of which I hardly feel
myself worthy—”</p>
<p>  “We shall see, we shall see,” said the Bajarnum all
too easily.</p>
<p>  Glystra’s eyes went to Nancy. She met his eyes a
moment, then looked away^ He frowned. Seen in the new context
beside the man he had known as Arthur Hidders, she took on a new
identity—one not unfamiliar. “The nun,” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder nodded. “Rather a clever disguise,
don’t you think?”</p>
<p>  “Clever—but why was it necessary?”</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum shrugged. “A fur-and-leather-dealer
might conceivably accumulate enough Earth exchange to make the old
world pilgrimage—but hardly likely that he would bring his talented
young concubine with him.”</p>
<p>  “She’s talented all right.”</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder turned his head, examined Nancy
with dispassionate appreciation. “A pity, really, that she had to
become a base tool of policy, she is apt at finer things . . . But
that fool Abbigens dropped the ship too far from Grosgarth and I
had no one at hand to serve me. Yes, a pity, since I will never use
a woman fresh from another man’s couch. And now she must find
another patron.” He glanced humorously at Mercodion. “I fancy that
she will not need to seek far, eh, Dain?”</p>
<p>  Mercodion flushed, darted an angry glance at
Lysidder. “My tastes are perhaps as nice, in some respects, as
yours, Bajarnum.”</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder settled back in his seat. “It’s no
matter; I have uses for her in Grosgarth. Let us proceed with the
oraculation.”</p>
<p>  Mercodion waved his hand. “Continue.”</p>
<p>  The Inculcator stepped forward, raised the
hypodermic.</p>
<p>  The point stung deep into Glystra’s neck. There was
a feeling of injection, of pressure.</p>
<p>  The prefect’s grip tightened on his arms, tensing in
anticipation of his motion. He noticed that Nancy had turned her
face to the floor; the Bajarnum of Beaujolais, however, watched the
proceedings with lively interest.</p>
<p>  A great dark hand clamped on his brain. His body
expanded enormously; his arms felt twenty feet long; his feet were
at the bottom of a cliff; his eyes were like two long pipes leading
out on the world. The Bajarnum’s voice came like a sibilant whisper
in a vast cave.</p>
<p>  “Ah, now he squirms. Now it takes on him.”</p>
<p>  The prefects held Glystra with practiced ease.</p>
<p>  “Look!” exclaimed the Bajarnum delightedly. “Look
how he flails about . . . Ah, he has caused me much trouble, that
one. Now he pays the price.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  But Glystra felt no pain. He had passed beyond mere
sensation. He was reliving his life, from earliest foetus up
through the years, reliving, re-experiencing, re-knowing every
detail of his existence. Reviewing these events was a great
super-consciousness, like an inspector watching a belt of fruit. As
each distorted concept, misunderstanding, fallacy appeared, the
hand of the inspector reached down, twitched events into rational
perspectives, smoothed out the neural snarls which had clogged
Glystra’s brain.</p>
<p>  Childhood flickered past the super-awareness, then
early life on Earth, his training among the planets of the System.
Big Planet bulked outside the space-ship port, again he crashed on
the Great Slope of Jubilith; again he set out on the long journey
to the east. He retraced his route through Tsalombar Woods,
Nomadland, past Edelweiss, the River Oust, Swamp Island, down the
monoline through the Hibernian March, Kirstendale, across the
desert toward Myrtlesee Fountain. Present time loomed ahead; he
plunged through like a train coming out of a tunnel. He was once
more aware and conscious, with the whole of his life rearranged,
all his knowledge ordered into compartments, ready for instant
use.</p>
<p>  The High Dain’s voice came to his ears. “You see him
with his brain purged and clear. Now you must hasten; in a few
minutes his life-force dwindles and he dies.”</p>
<p>  Glystra opened his eyes. His body was at once warm
and cool, tingling with sensitivity. He felt strong as a leopard,
agile, flooded with potential.</p>
<p>  He looked around the hall, studied the troubled
faces of the people before him. Victims they were, the result of
their inner warps. Nancy was pale as eggshell, her eyes full and
moist. He saw her as she was, divined her motives.</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum said doubtfully, “He looks perfectly
happy.”</p>
<p>  Mercodion answered, “That’s the common response. For
a brief period they float on a sea of well-being. Then their
vitality fails and they go. Hurry, Bajarnum; hurry if you wish
knowledge.”</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder spoke in a loud voice. “How can I
buy weapons from the System Arms Control? Who can I bribe?“</p>
<p>  Glystra looked down at the Bajarnum, at Mercodion,
at Nancy. The situation seemed suddenly one of vast humor; he found
it hard to control his face.</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum repeated the question, more
urgently.</p>
<p>  “Try Alan Marklow,” said Glystra, as if imparting a
precious secret.</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum leaned forward, excited in spite of
himself. “Alan Marklow? The chairman of the Control?” He sat back,
a pink flush, half-anger, half-anticipation, on his face. “So Alan
Marklow can be bought—the sanctimonious scoundrel.”</p>
<p>  “To the same extent as any other member of the
Control,” said Glystra. “That is the reasoning behind my advice: if
you plan to bribe any of them, the best person to subvert is the
man at the top.”</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum stared. The High Dain’s eyes narrowed.
He jerked upright in his seat.</p>
<p>  Glystra said, “As I understand it, you want weapons
so that you may extend your empire; am I right?”</p>
<p>  “In essence,” the Bajarnum admitted warily.</p>
<p>  “What is the motive behind this desire?”</p>
<p>  Mercodion raised his head, started to bellow an
order, thought better of it, clamped his mouth in a tight white
line.</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum reflected. “I wish to add glory to my
name, to make Grosgarth the queen city of the world, to punish my
enemies.”</p>
<p>  “Ridiculous. Futile.”</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder was nonplussed. He turned to
Mercodion. “Is this a usual manifestation?”</p>
<p>  “By no means,” snapped Mercodion. He could contain
his fury no longer. He leapt to his feet, black brows bristling.
“Answer the questions directly! What kind of oracle are you,
evading and arguing and asserting the ego which you must know has
been numbed by the drug of wisdom? I command you, act with greater
pliability, for you will die in two minutes and the Bajarnum has
much he wants to learn.”</p>
<p>  “Perhaps my question was inexact,” said the Bajarnum
mildly. He returned to Glystra. “What is the most practical method
for me to acquire metal weapons at a low cost?”</p>
<p>  “Join the Star Patrol,” said Glystra waggishly.
“They’ll issue you a sheath-knife and an ion-shine free.”</p>
<p>  Mercodion exhaled a deep breath. The Bajarnum
frowned. The interview was not going at all as he had expected. He
tried a third time. “Is it likely that Earth-Central will forcibly
federate Big Planet?”</p>
<p>  “Highly unlikely,” said Glystra, with complete
honesty. He thought it was almost time to die, and sank limply into
the chair.</p>
<p>  “Most unsatisfactory,” grumbled Mercodion.</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder chewed his lip, surveyed Glystra
with his deceptively candid eyes. Nancy stared numbly; for all his
sharpened perceptions, Glystra could not fathom her thoughts.</p>
<p>  “One more question,” said the Bajarnum. “How can I
best prolong my life?”</p>
<p>  Only by the sternest measures could Glystra control
his features. He responded in a weak and doleful voice, “Allow the
Inculcator to shoot you full of wisdom-stuff, as he has me.”</p>
<p>  “Faugh!” spat Mercodion. “The creature is
insufferable! Were he not three-quarters dead, I swear I would run
him through . . . Indeed—“</p>
<p>  But Glystra had slumped to the dais.</p>
<p>  “Drag the hulk to the ’toir-room,” roared Mercodion.
He turned to Charley Lysidder. “A miserable mistake, Bajarnum, and
if you wish, a second oracle will be prepared.”</p>
<p>  “No,” said the Bajarnum, thoughtfully surveying
Glys— tra’s body. “I wonder only what was his meaning.”</p>
<p>  “Aberrated mish-mash,” scoffed Mercodion.</p>
<p>  They watched the prefects take the body from the
hall.</p>
<p>  “Strange,” said Charley Lysidder. “He seemed
completely vital—a man very far from death ... I wonder what he
meant...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  A naked man stole through the night, trailing the
odor of death. He came through Nello’s garden plot, ducked into the
alley, quietly approached the street.</p>
<p>  No one was in sight or ear-shot. He trotted quietly
through the shadows to the house of the sword-smiths.</p>
<p>  Light glowed yellow through the shutters. He
knocked.</p>
<p>  Nymaster opened the door. He stood stock-still, his
eyes bulging. A second man came to look suspiciously over his
shoulder—Corbus, who stared a breathless moment. “Claude,” he said
huskily, “You’re—you’re—” his voice broke.</p>
<p>  Glystra said briskly, “We’ve got to hurry. First a
bath.”</p>
<p>  Corbus nodded wryly. “You need something of the
sort.” He turned to Nymaster. “Fill a tub. Get some clothes.”</p>
<p>  Nymaster turned away wordlessly.</p>
<p>  “They hauled me to their abbatoir,” said Glystra.
“They threw me in a bin full of corpses. When the head-boiler came
with his knife, I jumped out at him, and he went into a fit. I
escaped through the wall.“</p>
<p>  “Did they pump you full of nerve-juice?”</p>
<p>  Glystra nodded. “It’s quite an experience.” During
his bath he gave Corbus and Nymaster an account of his
adventures.</p>
<p>  “And now what?” Corbus asked.</p>
<p>  “Now,” said Glystra, “we do Charley Lysidder one in
the eye.”</p>
<p>  Half an hour later, slipping through the gardens,
they looked out on the marble courtyard where the Bajarnum’s
air-boat rested. A man in a scarlet tunic and black boots lounged
against the hood. An ion-shine at his waist.</p>
<p>  “What do you think?” whispered Glystra.</p>
<p>  “If we can get in it, I can fly it,” said
Corbus.</p>
<p>  “Good. I’ll run around behind him. You attract his
attention.” He disappeared.</p>
<p>  Corbus waited two minutes, then stepped out into the
court-yard, levelled his ion-shine. “Don’t move,” he said.</p>
<p>  The guard straightened, blinked angrily. “What’s
the—” Glystra appeared behind him. There was a dull sound; the
guard sagged. Glystra took his weapon, waved to Corbus. “Let’s
go.”</p>
<p>  Myrtlesee Fountain dwindled below them. Glystra
laughed exultantly. “We’re free, Corbus—we’ve done it.”</p>
<p>  Corbus looked out across the vast dark expanse. “I
won’t believe it until I see Earth Enclave below us.”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked at him in surprise. “Earth
Enclave?”</p>
<p>  Corbus said tartly. “Do you propose to fly to
Grosgarth?”</p>
<p>  “No. But think. We’re in a beautiful position.
Charley Lysidder is marooned at Myrtlesee Fountain—without his
air-car, without his radio to call for another, if he owns
one.”</p>
<p>  “There’s always the monoline,” said Corbus. “That’s
fast enough. He can be back in Grosgarth in four days.”</p>
<p>  “The monoline—exactly. He’ll use the monoline.
That’s where we’ll have him.”</p>
<p>  “Maybe easier said than done. He won’t venture out
unless he goes armed to the teeth.”</p>
<p>  “I don’t doubt it. He might conceivably send someone
else back to Grosgarth, but only if he owns another air-car. We’ll
have to make sure. There’s a spot, as I recall, where the monoline
passes under a bluff, which should suit us very well.”</p>
<p>  Corbus shrugged. “I don’t like to play a string of
luck too far—”</p>
<p>  “We don’t need luck now. We’re not the poor
hagridden fugitives that we were; we know what we’re doing. Before
the Bajarnum was hunting us; now we’re hunting him. Right down
there—” Glystra pointed “—that bald-headed bluff. We’ll settle on
top and wait out the night. Early tomorrow—if he’s coming at all—we
should see Charley Lysidder scudding west under full press of sail.
He’ll want to get back to Grosgarth as soon as possible.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <em>Vacancy in Beaujolais</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Some two hours after dawn a white speck of sail came
drifting across the desert from the green smudge that was Myrtlesee
Fountain.</p>
<p>  “Here comes the Bajarnum,” said Glystra, with
evident satisfaction.</p>
<p>  The trolley drew closer, swinging and swaying with
the changing force of the wind. It was a long pack-car, equipped
with two long lateen booms, and flew down the line gracefully as a
white swan.</p>
<p>  With a hum and spin of great wheels the contrivance
of wood and canvas slid under them, whirled on into the west. Four
men and one woman rode the platform: Charley Lysidder, three
Beaujolain nobles in scarlet tunics, elaborate black felt hats and
black boots—and Nancy.</p>
<p>  Glystra looked after the diminishing sail-car. “None
of them wore pleasant expressions.”</p>
<p>  “But they all wore ion-shines,” Corbus pointed out.
“It’ll be a risky business going near them.”</p>
<p>  “I don’t intend to go near them.” Glystra rose to
his feet, started back toward the air-car.</p>
<p>  Corbus said with mild testiness, “I don’t mind
chasing after you if I know what you’ve got on your mind; but if
you ask me you’re carrying this superman business a little too
far.”</p>
<p>  Glystra stopped short. “Do I really give that
impression?” He looked reflectively across the sandy wastes toward
the green paradise of Myrtlesee. “Perhaps it’s the normal state of
the psyche after such a traumatic shock.”</p>
<p>  “What’s the normal state?”</p>
<p>  “Introversion. Egocentricity.” He sighed. “I’ll try
to adjust myself.”</p>
<p>  “Maybe I’ll take a dose of that poison too.”</p>
<p>  “I’ve been thinking along the same lines. But now—
let’s catch Charley Lysidder.” He slid into the air-car.</p>
<p>  They flew west, over the tortured hills of obsidian,
the mounds of white sand, the rock flat, over the verge of the
great cliff. They slanted down, skimmed low over the tumble of rock
and scrub, already shimmering in the morning heat.</p>
<p>  The monoline rising to the lip of the cliff etched a
vast flat curve, a spiderweb line against the sky. Glystra veered
west, flew a mile past the bottom platform, landed under one of the
stanchions. “Here we violate the first of Clodleberg’s
commandments: we cut the line. In fact we excise a hundred feet—the
length between two of the stanchions should be enough.”</p>
<p>  He climbed one pole, slashed the line; Corbus did
the same at the second.</p>
<p>  “Now,” said Glystra, “we double the line, tie the
bight to the under-frame.”</p>
<p>  “Here’s a swingle-bar; that suit you?”</p>
<p>  “Fine. Two round turns and a couple half-hitches
should do the trick—” he watched while Corbus made the line fast.
“—and now we go back to the bottom anchor.”</p>
<p>  They returned to the platform from which the
monoline rose to the lip of the cliff. Glystra landed the air-car
in the shadow of the platform, jumped to the landing. “Pass up one
of those ends from under the boat.”</p>
<p>  Corbus pulled one of the trailing lengths clear,
tossed it up.</p>
<p>  “Now,” said Glystra, “we make fast to the monoline
with a couple of rolling hitches.”</p>
<p>  “Ah,” said Corbus. “I begin to catch on. The
Bajarnum won’t like it.”</p>
<p>  “The Bajarnum is not being consulted . . . You get
into the car, in case the weight of the monoline starts to drag . .
. Ready?”</p>
<p>  “Ready.”</p>
<p>  Glystra cut the monoline at a point four feet past
the first of his hitches. The line sang apart, the connection to
the air-car took hold, and a long wave swerved up the line and out
of sight. The air-car now served as the bottom anchor to the
monoline.</p>
<p>  Glystra joined Corbus. “I give them about an hour. A
little less if the wind is good.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Time passed. Phaedra shouldered huge and dazzling
into the dark blue Big Planet sky. Off into the brush a few albino
savages lurked and peered. Insects like eels with a dozen dragonfly
wings slid easily into the air, threading the harsh gray branches.
Round pink toads with eyes on antennae hopped among the rocks. At
the top of the cliff appeared a spot of white.</p>
<p>  “Here they come,” said Corbus.</p>
<p>  Glystra nodded. “The ride of their life coming
up.”</p>
<p>  The white spot at the top of the cliff dipped over
the edge, started down the long curve. Glystra chuckled. “I’d like
to watch the Bajarnum’s face.”</p>
<p>  He pushed down the power-arm. The car lifted from
behind the platform, climbed into the air—up, up, as high as the
lip of the cliff. The trolley rolled down into the lowest section
of the loop, slowed, hung suspended, helpless. Five black dots were
the passengers—agitated, outraged, uncertain.</p>
<p>  Glystra flew above the trolley to the monoline
landing at the top of the cliff, settled on the platform. The
second length of line under the air-car he made fast to that
section of the monoline which led over the cliff. He cut it, and
now the trolley with its five occupants hung entirely suspended
from the air car.</p>
<p>  Glystra peered over the brink. “There he is, the
Bajarnum of Beaujolais, trapped fair and square, and not a hand
laid on him.”</p>
<p>  “They’ve still got their guns,” said Corbus. “No
matter where we set ’em down, they still can shoot at us—even if we
take them as far as the Enclave.”</p>
<p>  “I’ve considered that. Dousing them in a lake will
cool Charley Lysidder’s temper as well as short out his
ion-shines.”</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum’s face, as he stood dripping on the
sand beach, was pinched and white. His eyes glinted like puddles of
hot quicksilver; he looked neither left nor right. His three noble
companions somehow contrived to maintain their dignity even while
water sucked squashily in their boots. Nancy’s hair clung dankly to
her cheeks. Her face was blank as a marble mask. She sat shivering,
teeth chattering audibly.</p>
<p>  Glystra tossed her his cloak. Draping it over her
shoulders and turning away, she slipped out of her sodden
garments.</p>
<p>  Glystra stood holding the ion-shine. “Now one at a
time into the car. Corbus will search you for knives and hooks and
like unpleasantness on the way.” He nodded to the Bajarnum. “You
first.”</p>
<p>  One by one they passed Corbus, who extracted three
daggers, the sodden ion-shines, and a deadly little poison
slap-sack from the group.</p>
<p>  “Back in the car, gentlemen,” said Glystra, “as far
back as possible.”</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum said in a voice soft as the hiss of
silk, “There shall be requiting, if I must live two hundred years
to see it.”</p>
<p>  Glystra laughed. “Now you spit nonsense, like an
angry cat. Any requiting to be done will be for the hundred
thousand children you’ve sold into space.”</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum blinked. “There has been no such
number.”</p>
<p>  “Well—no matter. A hundred or a hundred thousand—the
crime is the same.”</p>
<p>  Glystra climbed up into the seat beside Corbus, sat
looking down into the five faces. Charley Lysidder’s emotions were
clear enough: serpent-spite and fury behind the mask of the small
features in the too-big head. The three noblemen were uniformly
glum and apprehensive. And Nancy? Her face was rapt, her thoughts
were clearly far away. But Glystra saw neither fear, anger, nor
doubt. Her brow was clear, the line of her mouth was natural,
almost happy; her eyes flickered with the passage of her thoughts
like the flash of silver fish in dark water.</p>
<p>  Here, thought Glystra in sudden insight, is the
conflict of multiple personalities resolved; she has been at war
with herself; she has been caught in a flow too strong to resist;
she submits with relief. She feels guilt; she knows she will be
punished; she awaits punishment with joy.</p>
<p>  They were all settled. He turned to Corbus. “Let’s
go. Think you can find the Enclave?”</p>
<p>  “Hope so.” He rapped his knuckles on a black
cabinet. “We can find our way along the radio-beam after we get
around the planet.”</p>
<p>  “Good.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  The air-car rose into the air, flew west. The lake
vanished astern.</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder wrung water from the hem of his
cloak. He had recovered something of his suavity and spoke in a
thoughtful voice. “I think you wrong me, Claude Glystra. So indeed
I have sold starving waifs, but as a means to an end. Admittedly
the means was uncomfortable, but did not people die before Earth
became federated?”</p>
<p>  “Then your ambition is to federate Big Planet?”</p>
<p>  “Exactly.”</p>
<p>  “To what purpose?”</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum stared. “Why—would not there then be
peace and order?”</p>
<p>  “No, of course not—as you must know very well. Big
Planet could never be unified by conquest—certainly not by the
Beaujolain army mounted on zipangotes, and not in your lifetime. I
doubt if you care for peace and order. You have used your army to
invade and occupy Wale and Glaythree, both quiet farm-countries,
but the gypsies and the Rebbirs roam, ravage, murder at will.”</p>
<p>  Nancy turned, eyed the Bajarnum dubiously. The three
nobles glared truculently. Charley Lysidder preened a ring in his
mustache.</p>
<p>  “No,” said Glystra, “your conquests are motivated by
vanity and egotism. You are merely Heinzelman the Hell-horse in
better-looking clothes.”</p>
<p>  “Talk, talk, talk,” sneered Charley Lysidder. “Earth
commissions come and go, Big Planet swallows them all; they drown
like gnats in Batzimarjian Ocean.”</p>
<p>  Glystra grinned. “This commission is different—what
there’s left of it. I insisted on complete power before I took the
job. I do not recommend; I command.”</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum’s tight features squeezed even closer
together, as if he were tasting something bitter. “Assuming all
this were true—what would you do?”</p>
<p>  Glystra shrugged. “I don’t know. I have ideas, but
no program. One thing is certain: the slaughter, the slaving, the
cannibalism must stop.”</p>
<p>  “Hah!” The Bajarnum laughed spitefully. “So you’ll
call down Earth warboats, kill the gypsies, the rebbirs, the
nomads, the steppe-men, all the wandering tribes across Big
Planet—you’ll build an Earth Empire where I would build a
Beaujolain Realm.”</p>
<p>  “No,” said Glystra. “Clearly you do not grasp the
crux of the problem. Unity can never be imposed on the peoples of
Big Planet, any more than a state could be formed from a population
of ants, cats, fish, monkeys, elephants. A thousand years may pass
before Big Planet knows a single government. An Earth-dominated Big
Planet would be unwieldly, expensive, arbitrary—almost as bad as a
Beaujolain Empire.”</p>
<p>  “Then what do you plan?”</p>
<p>  Glystra shrugged. “Regional organization, small
regional guard-corps ...”</p>
<p>  The Bajarnum sniffed. “The whole decrepit
paraphernalia of Earth. In five years your regional commanders
become petty tyrants, your regional judges are soliciting bribes,
your regional policy-makers are enforcing uniformity on the
disparate communities.”</p>
<p>  “That indeed,” said Glystra, “is where we must tread
warily. ...”</p>
<p>  He looked out the window across the sun-drenched Big
Planet landscape. An endless vista, forested mountains, green
valleys, winding rivers, hot plains.</p>
<p>  He heard a muffled nervous cry. He twisted to find
two of the men in red tunics on their feet, crouching to leap. He
twitched the ion-shine; the men in the damp red tunics sank
back.</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder hissed a word Glystra could not
hear; Nancy shrank to the side of the boat.</p>
<p>  There was ten minutes of acrid silence. Finally the
Bajarnum said in a crackling self-conscious voice, “And, may I ask,
what you plan with us?”</p>
<p>  Glystra looked out the window again. “I’ll tell you
in another couple of hours.”</p>
<p>  They flew across an island-dappled sea, a gray
desert, a range of mountains with white peaks reaching angrily up
into dark blue sky. Over a pleasant rolling country dotted with
vineyards, Glystra said to Corbus, “This is far enough, I think.
We’ll set down here.”</p>
<p>  The air-boat touched ground.</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder hung back, his delicate features
working. “What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>  “Nothing. I’m turning you loose. You’re on your own.
You can try to get back to Grosgarth if you like. I doubt if you’ll
make it. If you stay here, you’ll probably have to work for a
living—the worst punishment I could devise.”</p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder, the three noblemen, sullenly
stepped out into the afternoon sunlight. Nancy hung back. Lysidder
gestured angrily. “I have much to say to you.”</p>
<p>  Nancy looked desperately at Glystra. “Won’t you let
me out elsewhere. . . .”</p>
<p>  Glystra shut the door. “Take ’er up, Corbus.” He
turned to Nancy. “I’m not setting you down anywhere,” he said
shortly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Charley Lysidder and his three companions became
minute shapes, mannikins in rich-colored clothes; rigid,
motionless, they watched the air-car swing across the sky. Charley
Lysidder raised his fist, shook it in a frenzy of hate. Glystra
turned away, grinning. “Now there’s no more Bajarnum of Beaujolais.
Vacancy, Corbus; need a job?”</p>
<p>  “I believe I’d make a medium-to-good king . . . Come
to think of it,” Corbus ruminated, “I’ve always wanted a nice
little feudal domain in a good wine country . . . Fancy uniforms,
operettas, beautiful women ...” his voice trailed off. “Anyway, put
my name down for the job.”</p>
<p>  “It’s yours, if I’ve anything to say about it—and I
have.”</p>
<p>  “Thanks. My first official act will be to clean out
that den of fakers, Myrtlesee Fountain. Or does my empire run that
far?”</p>
<p>  “If you want Myrtlesee Fountain you’ve got to take
the Palari Desert and the Rebbirs along with it.”</p>
<p>  “Draw the boundary along the River Oust,” said
Corbus. “I know when I’m well off.”</p>
<p>  Big Planet landscape, swimming in the halcyon light
of late afternoon, slipped astern. Glystra finally found it
impossible to ignore the quiet figure in the rear of the car. He
stepped down from the control platform, settled upon the seat
beside her. “As far as I’m concerned,” he said gruffly, “I’m
willing to believe that you were an unwilling accessory, and I’ll
see that—”</p>
<p>  She interrupted him in a low and passionate voice.
“I’ll never be able to make you believe that we were working for
the same things.”</p>
<p>  Glystra grinned a wry sad smile, remembering the
journey east out of Jubilith. Darrot, Ketch, Pianza, Bishop: all
dead, and if not by her direct action, at least with her
connivance. An angel with bloody hands. In order to win his
confidence she had feigned love, prostituted herself.</p>
<p>  “I know what you’re thinking,” she said, “but let me
speak—and then you may drop me anywhere, in the middle of the ocean

<p>  “The gypsies burnt my home with all inside,” she
added in a dull voice. “I told you so; it is true. I wandered to
Grosgarth, Charley Lysidder saw me at the Midsummer Festival. He
was crying crusade against all the outside world, and here, so I
thought, was how Big Planet might be made safe and evil beings like
the gypsies exterminated. He called me to his chambers; I did not
refuse. What girl refuses an emperor? He took me to Earth; on the
way back we learned of your plans. Apparently you projected nothing
more than the persecution of Charley Lysidder. I was bitter against
Earth and all its people. They lived in wealth and security, while
on Big Planet the great-grandchildren of Earth were murdered and
tormented. Why could they not help us?”</p>
<p>  Glystra started to speak; she made a weary gesture.
“I know what you will say: ‘Earth can only wield authority over a
finite volume of space. Anyone who passes through the boundaries
forfeits the protection of those within.’ That might have been
valid for the first ones to come out from Earth, but it seems cruel
to punish the children of these thoughtless ones forever and ever .
. . And it seemed that while you would do nothing to help us, you
wanted to thwart the only man on Big Planet with vision and power:
Charley Lysidder. And much as it hurt me, because—” she darted him
a brief look—“I had come to love you, I had to fight you.”</p>
<p>  “Why didn’t you?” asked Glystra.</p>
<p>  She shuddered. “I couldn’t. And I’ve lived in misery
... I can’t understand how you failed to suspect me.”</p>
<p>  “When I think back,” said Glystra, his eyes on the
past, “it seems as if I knew all the time, but could not make
myself believe it. There were a hundred indications. Morwatz’
troopers had us bound and helpless; you refused to cut us loose
until it was clear that the Beaujolains were dead and the gypsies
were coming. You thought the Fountain insects sounded like birds.
There are no birds on Big Planet. And when Bishop was killed—”</p>
<p>  “I had nothing to do with that. I tried to slip off
to the dome. He came after me and the priests killed him and took
his head.”</p>
<p>  “And Pianza?”</p>
<p>  She shook her head. “The traders had already killed
Pianza. I kept them from killing everyone else. But I let them take
the trolleys, because I thought that if you would only return to
Kirstendale we could live together safe and happy ...” She looked
at him and her mouth drooped. “You don’t believe anything of what
I’m saying.”</p>
<p>  “No, on the contrary, I believe everything ... I
wish I had your courage.”</p>
<p>  Corbus’ voice came raucously down from the control
platform. “You two are beginning to embarrass me. Clinch and get it
over with.”</p>
<p>  Glystra and Nancy sat in silence. After a moment
Glystra said, “There’s a lot of unfinished business behind us ...
On our way back we’ll drop in at Kirstendale and hire Cloyville to
pull us around the streets in a big carriage.”</p>
<p>  “Count me in,” said Corbus. “I’ll bring a long
whip.”</p>
