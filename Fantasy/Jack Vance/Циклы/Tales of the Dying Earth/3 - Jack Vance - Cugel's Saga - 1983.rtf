 of force. When Sadlark plunged into the mire, the dampness annulled his forces; the scales dispersed and Sadlark became disorganized, which is the overworld equivalent of mortality."}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

of paunce-wort, he noticed an iron tub, or trough, ten feet long by three feet wide, built to a purpose not now in evidence. Cugel examined the trough with care, then went to the back of the garden. Under the myrhadion tree he started to dig the grave ord

At the end of the afternoon Cugel was allowed an hour to his own devices. He laid a spray of lilies on Weamish's grave, then resumed digging in his own grave. . . .After a few moments he noticed Gookin's blue cap, where tha

 tucked the parcel into his pouch, then covered over the case, just as Gookin came hopping across the sward. "Cugel, you have overstayed your time! You must learn precision!"}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 Cugel chanced to approach that ancient tavern known as 'The Iron Cockatrice'. As he drew near, the door opened and two men lurched into the street: one massive, with yellow curls and a heavy jaw; the other lean, with gaunt cheeks, black hair and a hook
ed nose. Both wore costly garments, with double-tiered hats, red satin sashes and boots of fine leather.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 Cugel, looking once, then a second time, recognized Yelleg and Malser. Each had enjoyed at least a bottle of wine and possibly two. Yelleg sang a balla
d of the sea and Malser sang "Tirra la lirra, we are off to the land where the daisies grow!" in refrain. Preoccupied with the exact rhythm of their music, they brushed past Cugel, looking neither right nor left, and went off along the esplanade toward an
other tavern, 'The Star of the North'.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
Cugel started to follow, then jumped back at the rumble of approaching wheels. A fine carriage, drawn by a pair of high-stepping perchers, swerved in front of him and rolled off along the esplanade. The driver wore a black velvet suit with }{
\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid664526 silver}{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
 epaulettes, and a large hat with a curling black plume; beside him sat a buxom lady in an orange gown. Only with difficulty could Cugel identify the driver as Bilberd, former gardener at Flutic. Cugel muttered sourly under his 
breath: "Bilberd's new career, which I generously offered to finance, has cost me rather more than I expected."}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 Early the next morning Cugel left Saskervoy by the east road. He crossed over the hills and came down upon Shanglestone Strand.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

autiously Cugel circled the manse. The pond came into view. Out in the middle Twango sat in the iron scow, shoulders hunched and neck pulled down. As Cugel watched, Twango hauled in a rope; up from the depths came Gark with a small bucket of slime, which 
Twango emptied into the tub.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

aved at the overhead rope. Cugel watched a moment, then turned and went his way back to Saskervoy.}{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412

After a period Cugel paused to catch his breath. His mood was bitter. Through the duplicity of underlings he carried, not a valuable parcel of scales, but only a handful }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid664526\charrsid3035278 of}{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid664526

Cugel maintained an uneasy watch to either side, as was only prudent during these latter times. He saw much that was strange and sometimes beautiful: white blossoms held high on tall tendrils above spangles of low flat leaves; fairy castles
 of fungus growing in shelves, terraces and turrets over rotting stumps; patterns of black and orange bracken. Once, indistinct at a distance of a hundred yards, Cugel thought to see a tall man-like shape in a lavender jerkin. Cugel carried no weapon, and
 he breathed easier when the road, mounting a hillside, broke out into the afternoon daylight.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 At this moment Cugel heard the sound of Soldinck's wagon returning from Flutic. He stepped off the road and waited in the}{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid14878626  }{
\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 shadow of a rock. The wagon passed by, and Soldinck's grim expression was a convincing sign that his talks with Twango had not gone well.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

Cugel had thought to find little more than a village. Saskervoy exceeded his expectations, both in size and in its air of ancient respectability. Tall narrow houses stood side by side along the streets, the s
tone of their structure weathered by ages of lichen, smoke and sea-fog. Windows glistened and brass-work twinkled in the red sunlight; such was the way at Saskervoy.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 Cugel followed the road down into the town and proceeded toward the harbor. Strangers were
 evidently a novelty for the folk of Saskervoy. At Cugel's approach, all stopped to stare, and not a few hurriedly crossed the street. They seemed, thought Cugel, a people of old-fashioned habit, and perhaps conservative in their views. The men wore black
 swallow-tail coats with voluminous trousers and black buckled shoes, while the women, in their shapeless gowns and round punch-bowl hats pulled low, were like dumplings.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 Soldinck's standards of payment, the scales might or might not cover the costs of a sea voyage.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

The time was sunset. Cugel went forward to the bow and stood under the lantern, as Drofo was wont to do. Tonight the western sky was dramatic with a high array of cirrus wisps scarlet on the dark blue sky. At the horizon th
e sun lingered and hesitated, as if reluctant to leave the world of daylight. A sour blue-green corona rimmed the edge of the globe: a phenomenon which Cugel had never noticed before. A purple bruise on the sun's surface seemed to pulse, like the orifice 
of a polyp: a portent? .... Cugel started to turn away, then, struck by a sudden thought, looked up into the lantern. The glow-box, spurts and lumenex, which Cugel had removed from the stern lantern, were not to be seen here either.}{

be wise to tuck a reef into the sail.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

The light of sunset died. Cugel pondered the strange events of the voyage. To sail south all day and wake up the next morning in waters farther north than the starting point of the day before: this was an unnatural sequ

oked at the escalabra; the claw indicated 'South'. Cugel went to the taff-rail and casually glanced up into the lantern. The glow-box was not in place, which proved nothing. Cugel said to Madame Soldinck: "A nice breeze will rest the worms."}{

Madame Soldinck deigned no response. Cugel descended to a dinner which in all respects met his critical standards. The meal was served by the 'night-steward' Salasser, whom Cugel found no less charming than her s
isters. Tonight she had dressed her hair in the style of the Spanssian Corybants, and wore a simple white gown belted at the waist with a golden rope \emdash 
 a costume which nicely set off her slender figure. Of the three girls, Salasser possessed possibly the most refined intelligence, and her conversation, while sometimes quaint, impressed Cugel by reason of its freshness and subtlety.}{

region known as the Land of the Falling Wall. To the north a blunt peninsula marked 'Gador Porrada' shouldered into the ocean, apparently uninhabited save for the village 'Tustvold'. South of the Chaing, another peninsula: 'The Dragon's Neck', longer and 
n
arrower than Gador Porrada, thrust a considerable distance into the ocean, to terminate in a scatter of rocks, reefs and small islands: 'The Dragon-Fangs'. Cugel studied the chart in detail, then closed the portfolio with a fateful thud. "So be it!" said 
Cugel. "How long, oh how long, must I entertain false}{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid6055428  hopes and fond dreams? Still, }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 all will be well. . . .Let us see how the land lays."}{

with a hull ill-adapted to sailing, made a great deal of leeway. For best speed Cugel fell away several poi
nts to the east, in the process veering closer upon the low-lying coast, while the cog pressed relentlessly down upon him. Cugel desperately swung the wheel, thinking to achieve a remarkable down-wind jibe which would totally discomfit those persons aboar
d the cog, not to mention Madame Soldinck. For best effect he sprang down upon the deck to trim the sheets, but before he could return to the wheel, the ship rushed off downwind.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 ship back on a starboard reach. Glancing toward the near shore of Gador Porrada, Cugel saw a curious sight: a group of sea-birds walking on what appeared to be the surface of the water. Cugel stared in wonder, as the sea-birds walked this way and that, o
ccasionally lowering their heads to peck at the surface.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 lower a boat. Madame Soldinck and the girls waved their arms in excitement. Cugel wasted no time in farewells. He lowered himself over the side and floundered toward the shore.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

y were members of a dark-skinned race notable for amber eyes, aquiline features and proudly erect posture. Their garments were no less distinctive: pantaloons bound with sashes, shins with wing collars, under-jackets and cut-away tabards, in the colors of
 
black, tan, fusk and umber. They wore wide-brimmed black hats with slouch crowns, which Cugel considered of excellent address. They had brought with them a great high-wheeled wagon loaded with objects concealed under a tarpaulin. As the elder of the group
 conferred with Nisbet, the others removed the cloth, to reveal what appeared to be a large number of stacked corpses.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 Cugel somewhat aside and pointed to a far mound. "That is Old QaHr which once held sway from the Falling Wall to the Silkal Strakes. During their high age the folk of QaHr practiced a unique religion, which, I suppose, is no more preposterous than any ot

While he spoke the Maot traders had unloaded the corpses, laid them in a row, and roped them together. The elder signaled Nisbet who walked along the line of corpses, touching each with his amulet. He then wal
ked back along the line and delivered to each corpse the activating kick. The Maot elder paid Nisbet his fee; there was an interchange of gracious small talk and then the Maots set off to the northeast, the corpses drifting behind at an altitude of fifty

d his finger alongside his crooked old nose and turned Cugel a mischievous leer. "I have learned how to control the women of Tustvold Village, or, for that matter, women in general! Never give them all they want! That is the secret of my success! In this

SETTING his course by the bloated red sun, Cugel journeyed south across an arid wasteland. Small boulders cast black shadows; an occasional stand-back bush, with leaves like fleshy pink ear-lobes, thrust thorns toward Cugel as he passed.}{

The horizons were blurred behind haze the color of watered carmine. No human artifact could be seen, nor any living creature, except on a single occasion when, far to the south, Cugel noted a pelgr

\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 At larger sink-holes dark blue weeping-willow trees hung over the edge, half-concealing ro

\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 The folk who had built the tree-towers were difficul
t to see among the shadows of the foliage; Cugel glimpsed them as they darted across their queer little windows, and several times he thought to see them slipping into the sink-hole on slides polished from the native limestone. Their stature was that of a
 
small human being or a boy, though their countenances suggested a peculiar hybridization of reptile, stalking bang-nose beetle and miniature gid. To cover their gray-green pelts they wore flounced belly-guards of pale fiber, and caps with black ear-flaps,
 apparently fabricated from human skulls.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

ravel by night, he would certainly blunder into a sink-hole. If he thought to wrap himself in his cloak and sleep in the open, he thereupon became prey for visps, which stood nine feet tall and looked across the night through luminous pink eyes, and trace
d the scent of flesh by means of two flexible proboscises growing from each side of their scalp-crest.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 From within nothing could be heard but hisses and whispers. Watching in all dire
ctions, Cugel circled the structure. He found a door and thrust in the torch, to discover a work-room, with a polished limestone bench across one wall, on which rested several alabaster ewers, cups and trenchers. There was neither hearth nor stove; eviden
tly the tree-tower folk shunned the use of fire; nor was there communication with the upper levels, by means of ladders, traps or stairs.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 Cugel left his branches of brittlebush and his burning torch on the dirt floor and went to gather more fuel. In the plu

then: let us see what there is to be seen." Cugel removed the limestone slab from the door. All was quiet: even more quiet than before. The entire sink-hole held its breath. Cugel studied the ground before the tree-tower. He looked right and left, to disc
over cords dangling from the branches of the tree. The ground before the door had been sprinkled with a suspicious amount of soil, which failed to conceal altogether the outlines of a net.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

farmers: angels of mercy by comparison, nevertheless with certain nasty habits. They give their mermelants beer to drink, then send them out to intimidate travellers. They dared to come up here one day, stamping up and down the porch and showing their bel

Cugel dined upon bread and sausages, then strolled out to the front of the inn. His attention was attracted by an altercation near Varmous' caravan. Looking more closely, Cugel found Varmous in angry confrontation with Captain Wiski

 force that he tumbled over backwards. The crew of the }{\b0\i\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 Avventura }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 tied to each and the passengers took their places. Cugel, walking from vehicle to vehicle, kicked to apply that levitational force still clinging to his boots. The wagons and carriages drifted into the air; the teamsters took the ropes and waited for the

 caravan of six high-wheeled wagons, and his uncertainty dissolved; the town was evidently tolerant of strangers, and Cugel confidently set off down the hill.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 the fire, adjusting screws and levers which in turn controlled the mirrors and lenses. They wore what appeared to be the local costume: voluminous blue knee-length breeches, red shirts, brass-buttoned black vests and broad-brimmed hats; after disinterest
ed glances they paid Cugel no heed, and he continued to the inn.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 In the adjacent garden two dozen folk of the town sat at tables, eating and drinking with great gusto. Cugel watched them a moment or two; their punctilio and elegant gestures suggested the ma
nners of an age far past. Like their houses, they were a sort unique to Cugel's experience, pale and thin, with egg-shaped heads, long noses, dark expressive eyes and ears cropped in various styles. The men were uniformly bald and their pates glistened in
 
the red sunlight. The women parted their black hair in the middle, then cut it abruptly short a half-inch above the ears: a style which Cugel considered unbecoming. Watching the folk eat and drink, Cugel was unfavorably reminded of the fare which had sust
ained him across the Pale Rugates, and he gave no further thought to his terces. He strode into the garden and seated himself at a table. A portly man in a blue apron approached, frowning somewhat at Cugel'}{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid1639465 
s disheveled appearance. Cugel }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 immediately brought 
forth two terces which he handed to the man. "This is for yourself, my good fellow, to insure expeditious service. I have just completed an arduous journey; }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid8748279 I}{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
 am famished with hunger. You may bring me a platter identical to that which the gentleman yonder 
is enjoying, together with a selection of side-dishes and a bottle of wine. Then be so good as to ask the innkeeper to prepare me a comfortable chamber." Cugel carelessly brought forth his purse and dropped it upon the table where its weight produced an i
mpressive implication. "I will also require a bath, fresh linen and a barber."}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 all stark bald."}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

The innkeeper nodded thoughtfully. "The architecture at least is quickly explained. The ancient Gunds lived in enormous gourds. When a section of the wall became weak it was replaced with a board, until in due course the folk found themsel
ves living in houses fashioned completely of wood, and the style has persisted. As for the fire and the projectors, do you not know the world-wide Order of Solar Emosynaries? We stimulate the vitality of the sun; so long as our beam of sympathetic vibrati
on regulates solar combustion, it will never expire. Similar stations exist at other locations: at Blue Azor; on the Isle of Brazel; at the walled city Munt; and in the observatory of the Grand Starkeeper at Vir Vassilis."}{

Maier threw up his hands in perplexity. "These complications surpass my scope, but yonder stands the Nolde Huruska." He directed Cugel's attention to a large man with a deep chest and bristling black beard, who stood a
t the entrance. "Excuse me a moment." He rose to his feet and approaching the Nolde spoke for several minutes, indicating Cugel from time to time. The Nolde finally made a brusque gesture and marched across the garden to confront Cugel. He spoke in a heav

gel suppressed the hot remark which rose to his lips, and contented himself with a shrug. Maier walked away with the Nolde and for several minutes the two men conferred, with frequent glances in Cugel's direction. Then the Nolde departed and the innkeeper
 returned to Cugel's table. "A somewhat brusque man, the Nolde of Gundar," he told Cugel, "but very competent withal."}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 can offer no definite explanation. According to our savants, the condition signifies the final perfection of the human race. Other folk give credence to an ancient legend. A pair of magicians, Astherlin and Mauldred, vied for the favor of the
 Gunds. Astherlin promised the boon of extreme hairiness, so that the folk of Gundar need never wear garments. Mauldred, to the contrary, offered the Gunds baldness, with all the consequent advantages, and easily won the contest; in fact Mauldred became t
h
e first Nolde of Gundar, the post now filled, as you know, by Huruska." Maier the innkeeper pursed his lips and looked off across the garden. "Huruska, a distrustful sort, has reminded me of my fixed rule to ask all transient guests to settle their accoun

a crate of earthenware goblets. Cugel tried to initiate a conversation but for once Maier could take no time from his labors. "The Nolde Huruska goes off on a journey and tonight his friends mark the occasion with a farewell party, for which I must make c

red a dock at which the fishermen moored their punts and dried their nets. Cugel looked up and down the river, then returned up the path to the inn, to spend the rest of the day watching the seventeen maidens as they strolled about the square, or sipped s

 in absolute anonymity, however! Whenever Huruska starts upon a mug of ale, I want you to place a full mug before him, so that his evening will be incessantly merry. If he asks who has bought the dr

The group marched up worn marble steps, through an enormous arched portal, into an echoing hall, distinguished only by the high dome and an adytum or altar at the far end. Cugel was led into a side-chamber, illumina
ted by high circular windows and paneled with dark blue wood. An old man in a white gown entered the room and asked: "What have we here? A person suffering affliction?"}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

eld up his hand. "Calm yourself!}{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
 You must remember that we are a benevolent people, lacking all spite or malice. We exist only to help other sentient beings! If a person commits a crime, we are racked with sorrow for 
the criminal, whom we believe to be the true victim, and we work without compromise that he may renew himself."}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

 high years of the Great Magics the city fell under the sway of Yasbane the Obviator, who breached openings into five demon-realms and constructed the five temples of Lumarth. You stand now in the Temple of Phampoun."}{

eyes against the light. The grey torso wallowed almost the length of the dais; the massive splayed legs were planted flat to the floor. Arms, as large around as Cugel himself, terminated in fingers three feet long, each bedecked with a hundred jeweled rin
gs. Phampoun's head was as large as a wheelbarrow, with a huge snout and an enormous loose-wattled mouth. The two eyes, each the size of a dishpan, could not be seen for the protective hemispheres.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

cord ran from the lamp, across the ceiling, to dangle beside Phampoun's fingers; almost as a reflex Cugel detached the cord from the lamp. He saw a single egress from the chamber: a low iron doo
r directly behind Phampoun's chair. The chute by which he had entered was now invisible.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

Ha, has time gone by so swiftly?" The creature, leaning forward, consulted a mark on the wall. "It has indeed; I have overslept and Phampoun will be cross. What is your name and what are your crimes? These details are of interest to Phampoun \emdash

sted a prodigous meal before retiring. Excuse me while I check the progress of Phampoun's digestion." Pulsifer ducked back behind Phampoun's wattles and revealed himself only by a vibration in the corded grey neck. Presently he returned to view. "He is qu

sound: a grinding scream which propelled Pulsifer forth to vibrate like a flag in the wind. Phampoun lunged from the altar to fall sprawling and rolling across the floor of the temple, all the while maintaining his cataclysmic outcries. He pulled himself 
erect, and pounding the tiled floor with his great feet, he sprang here and there and at last burst through the stone walls as if they were paper, while the Kind Folk in the square stood petrified.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 Cugel, taking the two sacks of gold, departed the temple by
 a side entrance. For a moment he watched Phampoun careering around the square, screaming and flailing at the sun. Pulsifer, desperately gripping a pair of tusks, attempted to steer the maddened demon, who, ignoring all restraint, plunged eastward through
 the city, trampling down trees, bursting through houses as if they failed to exist.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

board. A punt approached the dock from upriver, poled vigorously by a}{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid12403040  }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
large man in tattered garments. Cugel turned away, pretending no more than a casual interest in the view, until he might board the skiff without attracting attention.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 The punt touched the dock; the boatman climbed up a ladder.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

to the congested face of Huruska, the Nolde of Gundar, though his face was barely recognizable for the bites Huruska had suffered from the insects of the Lallo Marsh.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 
\par }{\b0\f54\fs24\cf1\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278 Huruska stared long and hard at Cugel. "This is a most gratifying occasion!" he said husk
ily. "I feared that we would never meet again. And what do you carry in those leather bags?" He wrested a bag from Cugel. "Gold from the weight. Your prophecy has been totally vindicated! First honors and a voyage by water, now wealth and revenge! Prepare
 to die!"}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

d with the knots in the mooring-line of the skiff. The line at last came loose; Cugel pulled the skiff close as Huruska came charging down the dock like a bull. Cugel had no choice but to abandon his gold, jump into the skiff, push off and ply the oars wh

Cugel pensively hoisted the sail; the wind carried him down the river and around a bend. Cugel's last view of Lumarth, in the dying light of afternoon, included the low lustrous domes of the demon temples and the d
ark outline of Huruska standing on the dock. From afar the screams of Phampoun were still to be heard and occasionally the thud of toppling masonry.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278

After four miles the road angled up to a gray plain studded at intervals with twelve-foot pillars of gray stone. Cugel found a large pebble, and placing his right hand on his buttock made a profound salute to the object. He scratched upon it a sign

pole, Cugel had damaged a growth of brown palps. The resulting exudation had dripped upon the dreams and when Cugel picked up one of the fragile flakes, he saw that its edges glowed with eery fringes of color. The combination of oozes which had permeated

came acquainted with Lorgan, a dealer in fancy embroideries. Lorgan enjoyed both large talk and generous quantities of drink. Cugel was in no mood for either and pleading fatigue retired early to his Chamber. Lorgan remained in bibulous conversation with

again relaxed. The odd sound came again, somewhat louder, and a dozen large whispering bat-like creatures flew out of the shadows. They darted into Cugel's face and climbed on his neck with their claws, hoping to distract his attention while a black eel w

 muttered a spell of eleven syllables, so that the air between himself and Cugel twisted and thickened. The forces veered out toward Cugel and past, to rattle away in all directions, cutting russet and black streaks through the grass.}{

ight hand came the Forest Da, softer and sweeter than the Great Erm to the far north. River and road plunged into the shade, and all sound was hushed. Long-stemmed flowers grew in the mold: delice, blue-bell, rosace, cany-flake. Coral fungus clung to dead
 stumps like cloths of fairy lace. Maroon sunlight slanted across the forest spaces, creating a gloom saturated with a dozen dark colors. Nothing moved and no sound could be heard but the trill of a far bird.}{\b0\f54\fs24\insrsid4274412\charrsid3035278
