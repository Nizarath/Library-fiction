<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><a name=telek><span
style='font-family:Arial'>The soaring imagination </span></a><span
style='font-family:Arial'>of Jack Vance needs little introduction here. Twice a
Hugo winner, long cherished by science-fiction enthusiasts for the vivid
individuality of his style and the fertility of his inventive mind, this
Californian had already reached the highest rank of the field when this novella<i>
</i>of telekinetic powers appeared late in 1951. His work since that time has
served only to consolidate the position he held then. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Telek</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Jack Vance</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:16.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>I.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp and Shorn stood in the sad
light of sundown, high on the rim of the new stadium. Wooded hills rolled away
to either side; behind them, far to the west, the towers of Tran cut
sword-shaped notches into the sky. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp pointed east, up
Swanscomba Valley, now glowing a thousand tones of gold and green in the long
light of sunset. &quot;That's where I was born, by that row of poplars. I knew
the valley well in the old days.&quot; He spent a moment in far reflection.
&quot;I hate to see the changes, the old things wiped out. There&quot;—he
pointed —&quot;by the stream was Pimssi's croft and stone barn. There, where
you see the grove of oaks, that was the village Cobent. There, by Poll Point,
was the valley power tank. There, the Tran aquaport crossed the river, entered
the tunnel. It was considered beautiful, the aquaport, antique, overgrown with
ivy, stained with lichen. And only six months ago; already it seems a hundred
years.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn, intending to make a
delicate request, considered how best to take advantage of Geskamp's nostalgia
for the irretrievable past; he was faintly surprised to find Geskamp, a big
jutfaced man with gray-blond hair, indulging in sentiment of any kind.
&quot;There is certainly no recognizing it now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. It's all tidy and clean.
Like a park. Look up that mile of clear lawn. I liked it better in the old
days. Now it's waste, nothing else.&quot; Geskamp cocked his bristling eyebrows
at Shorn. &quot;Do you know, they hold me responsible, the farmers and
villagers? Because I'm in charge, I gave the orders?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They strike out at what's
closest.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I merely earn my salary. I
did what I could for them. Completely useless, of course; there never were
people so obdurate as the Teleks. Level the valley, build a stadium. Hurry, in
time for their midsummer get-together. I say, why not build in Mismarch Valley,
around the mountain, where only sheepherders would be disturbed, no crofts and
farms to be broken up, no village to be razed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What did they say to
that?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It was Forence Nollinrude I
spoke to; you know him?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I've seen him: one of their
liaison committee. A young man, rather more lofty than the average.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp spat on the concrete under
his feet. &quot;The young ones are the worst. He asked, 'Do we not give you
enough money? Pay them well, clear them out. Swanscomba Valley is where we will
have our stadium.' So&quot;—Geskamp held out his hands in a quick
gesticulation—&quot;I bring out my machines, my men. We fly in material. For
those who have lived here all their lives there is no choice; they take their
money and go. Otherwise some morning perhaps they look out their door and find
polar ice or mountains of the moon. I'd not put such refinement past the
Teleks.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Strange tales are
told,&quot; Shorn agreed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp pointed to the grove of
oaks. His shadow, cast against the far side of the stadium by the level rays of
the sun, followed the motion. &quot;The oaks they brought, so much did they
condescend. I explained that transplanting a forest was a job of great delicacy
and expense. They were indifferent. 'Spend as much as you like.' I told them
there wasn't enough time; if they wanted the stadium inside the month; finally
they were aroused. Nollinrude and the one called Henry Motch stirred
themselves, and the next day we had all our forest—But would they dispose of
the waste from the aquaport, cast it in the sea? No. 'You hire four thousand
men, let them move the rubble, brick by brick if need be; we have business
elsewhere.' And they were gone.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A peculiar people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Peculiar?&quot; Geskamp
gathered his bushy eyebrows into arches of vast scorn. &quot;Madmen. For a
whim—a town erased, men and women sent forth homeless.&quot; He waved his hand
around the stadium. &quot;Two hundred million crowns spent to gratify
irresponsible popinjays whose only—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A droll voice above them said,
&quot;I hear myself bespoken.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The two men jerked around. A man
stood in the air ten feet above them. His face was mercurial and lighthearted;
a green cap hung waggishly to the side of his head; dark hair hung below,
almost to his shoulders. He wore a flaring red cape, tight green trousers, black
velvet shoes. &quot;You speak in anger, with little real consideration. We are
your benefactors; where would you be without us?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Living normal lives,&quot;
growled Geskamp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Telek was disposed to
facetiousness. &quot;Who is to say that yours is a normal life? In any event,
our whim is your employment; we formulate our idle dreams, you and your men
enrich yourselves fulfilling them, and we're both the better for it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Somehow the money always
ends up back with the Teleks. A mystery.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, no mystery whatever. It
is the exercise of economic law. In any event, we procure the funds, and we
would be fools to hoard. In our spending you find occupation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We would not be idle
otherwise.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps not. Perhaps . . .
well, look.&quot; He pointed across the stadium to the shadows on the far wall.
&quot;Perhaps there is your bent.&quot; And as they watched, their shadows
became active. Shorn's shadow bent forward, Geskamp's shadow drew back, aimed
and delivered a mighty kick, then turned, bent, and Shorn's shadow kicked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Telek cast no shadow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp snorted, Shorn smiled
grimly. They looked back overhead, but the Telek had moved high and was
drifting south. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Offensive creature,&quot;
said Geskamp. &quot;A law should be passed confiscating their every
farthing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shook his head. &quot;They'd
have it all back by nightfall. That's not the answer.&quot; He hesitated, as if
about to add something further. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp, already irked by the
Telek, did not take the contradiction kindly. Shorn, an architectural draughtsman,
was his subordinate. &quot;I suppose you know the answer?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I know several answers. One
of them is that they should all be killed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp's irritation had never
carried him quite so far. Shorn was a strange, unpredictable fellow.
&quot;Rather bloodthirsty,&quot; he said heavily. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shrugged. &quot;It might be
best in the long run.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp's eyebrows lowered into a
straight bar of gold-gray bristle across his face. &quot;The idea is
impractical. The creatures are hard to kill.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn laughed. &quot;It's more
than impractical—it's dangerous. If you recall the death of Vernisaw
Knerwig—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Vemisaw Knerwig had been punctured
by a pellet from a high-power rifle, fired from a window. The murderer, a
wild-eyed stripling, was apprehended. But the jail had not been tight enough to
keep him. He disappeared. For months misfortune dogged the town. Poison
appeared in the water supply. A dozen fires roared up one night. The roof of
the town school collapsed. And one afternoon a great meteor struck down from
space and obliterated the central square. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Killing Teleks is dangerous
work,&quot; said Geskamp. &quot;It's not a realistic thought. After all,&quot;
he said hurriedly, &quot;they're men and women like ourselves; nothing illegal
has ever been proved.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn's eyes glittered.
&quot;Illegality? When they dam the whole stream of human development?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp frowned. &quot;I'd hardly
say—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The signs are clear enough
when a person pulls his head up out of the sand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The conversation had got out of
hand; Geskamp had been left behind. Waste and excess he admitted, but there
were so few Teleks, so many ordinary people; how could they be dangerous? It
was strange for an architect. He looked sidewise in cautious calculation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn was faintly smiling.
&quot;Well, what do you make of it?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You take an extreme
position. It's hardly conceivable—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The future is unknown.
Almost anything is conceivable. We might become Teleks, all of us. Unlikely? I
think so myself. The Teleks might die out, disappear. Equally unlikely. They've
always been with us, all of history, latent in our midst. What are the
probabilities? Something like the present situation, a few Teleks among the
great mass of common people?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp nodded. &quot;That's my
opinion.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Picture the future then.
What do you see?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing extraordinary. I
imagine things will move along much as they have been.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You see no trend, no curve
of shifting relationships?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The Teleks are an
irritation, certainly, but they interfere very little in our lives. In a sense
they're an asset. They spend their money like water; they contribute to the
general prosperity.&quot; He looked anxiously into the sky through the
gathering dusk. &quot;Their wealth, it's honestly acquired; no matter where
they find those great blocks of metal.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The metal comes from the
moon, from the asteroids, from the outer planets.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp nodded. &quot;Yes, that's
the speculation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The metal represents
restraint. The Teleks are giving value in return for what they could
take.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Of course. Why shouldn't
they give value in return?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No reason at all. They
should. But now—consider the trend. At the outset they were ordinary citizens.
They lived by ordinary conventions; they were decent people. After the first
congress they made their fortunes for performing dangerous and unpleasant
tasks. Idealism, public service was the keynote. They identified themselves
with all of humanity, and very praiseworthy, too. Now, sixty years later.
Consider the Teleks of today. Is there any pretension to public service? None.
They dress differently, speak differently, live differently. They no longer
load ships or clear jungles or build roads; they take an easier way, which
makes less demands on their time. Humanity benefits; they bring us platinum,
palladium, uranium, rhodium, all the precious metals, which they sell at half
the old price, and they pour the money back into circulation.&quot; He gestured
across the stadium. &quot;And meanwhile the old ones are dying and the new
Teleks have no roots, no connection with common man. They draw ever farther
away, developing a way of living entirely different from ours.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp said half-truculently,
&quot;What do you expect? It's natural, isn't it?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn put on a patient face.
&quot;That's exactly the point I'm trying to make. Consider the trend, the
curve. Where does this 'natural' behavior lead? Always away from common
humanity, the old traditions, always toward an elite-herd situation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp rubbed his heavy chin.
&quot;I think that you're ... well, making a mountain out of a molehill.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Do you think so? Consider
the stadium, the eviction of the old property-owners. Think of Vernisaw Knerwig
and the revenge they took.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing was proved,&quot;
said Geskamp uneasily. What was the fellow up to? Now he was grinning, a
superior sort of grin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;In your heart, you agree
with what I say; but you can't bring yourself to face the facts—because then
you'd be forced to take a stand. For or against.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp stared out across the
valley, wholly angry, but unable to dispute Shorn's diagnosis. &quot;I don't
see the facts clearly.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There are only two courses
for us. We must either control the Teleks, that is, make them answerable to
human law—or we must eliminate them entirely. In blunt words—kill them. If we
don't—they become the masters; we the slaves. It's inevitable.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp's anger broke surface. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why do you tell me all these
things? What are you driving at? This is strange talk to hear from an
architect; you sound like one of the conspirators I've heard rumors of.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm talking for a specific
purpose—just as I worked on this job for a specific purpose. I want to bring
you to our way of thinking.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh. So that's the way of
it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And with this accomplished,
recruit your ability and your authority toward a concrete end.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Who are you? What is this
group?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A number of men worried by
the trend I mentioned.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A subversive society?&quot;
Geskamp's voice held a tinge of scorn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn laughed. &quot;Don't let the
flavor of words upset you. Call us a committee of public-spirited
citizens.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You'd be in trouble if the
Teleks caught wind of you,&quot; said Geskamp woodenly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They're aware of us. But
they're not magicians. They don't know who we are.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I know who you are,&quot;
said Geskamp. &quot;Suppose I reported this conversation to Nollinrude?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn grinned. &quot;What would
you gain?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A great deal of money.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You'd live the rest of your
life in fear of revenge.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't like it,&quot; said
Geskamp in a brutal voice. &quot;I don't care to be involved in any undercover
plots.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Examine your conscience.
Think it over.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The attack on Forence Nollinrude
came two days later. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The construction office was a long
L-shaped building to the west of the stadium. Geskamp stood in the yard angrily
refusing to pay a trucker more than the agreed scale for his concrete
aggregate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I can buy it cheaper in half
a dozen, places,&quot; roared Geskamp. &quot;You only got the contract in the
first place because I went to bat for you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The trucker had been one of the
dispossessed farmers. He shook his head mulishly. &quot;You did me no favor.
I'm losing money. It's costing me three crowns a meter.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp waved an arm angrily
toward the man's equipment, a small hopper carried by a pair of ramcopters.
&quot;How do you expect to make out with that kind of gear? All your profit
goes in running back and forth to the quarry. Get yourself a pair of Samson
lifts; you'll cut your costs to where you can make a few crowns.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm a farmer, not a trucker.
I took this contract because I had what I have. If I go in the hole for heavy
equipment, then I'm stuck with it. It'll do me no more good now, the job's
three-quarters done. I want more money, Geskamp, not good advice.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well, you can't get it from
me. Talk to the purchasing agent; maybe he'll break down. I got you the
contract, that's as far as I go.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I already talked to the
purchasing agent; he said nothing doing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Strike up one of the Teleks
then; they've got the money. I can't do anything for you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The trucker spat on the ground.
&quot;The Teleks, they're the devils who started this whole thing. A year ago I
had my dairy—right where that patch of water is now. I was doing good. Now I've
got nothing; the money they gave me to get out, most of it's gone in this
gravel. Now where do I go? I got my family.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp drew his bushy gray-blond
eyebrows together. &quot;I'm sorry, Hopson. But there's nothing I can do.
There's the Telek now; tell him your troubles.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Telek was Forence Nollinrude,
a tall yellow-haired man, magnificent in a rust cape, saffron trousers, black
velvet slippers. The trucker looked across the yard to where he floated a
fastidious three feet above the ground, then resolved himself and trudged
sullenly forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn, inside the office, could
hear nothing of the interview. The trucker stared up belligerently, legs spread
out. Forence Nollinrude turned himself a little to the side, looked down with
distaste deepening the lines at the corners of his mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The trucker did most of the
talking. The Telek replied in curt monosyllables, and the trucker became
progressively more furious. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp had been watching with a
worried frown. He started across the yard, with the evident intention of calming
the trucker. As he approached, Nollinrude pulled himself a foot or two higher,
drew slightly away, turned toward Geskamp, motioned toward the trucker as if
requiring Geskamp to remove the annoyance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The trucker suddenly seized a bar
of reinforcing iron, swung mightly, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp bawled hoarsely; Forence
Nollinrude jerked away, but the iron caught him across the shins. He cried in
agony, drew back, looked at the trucker. The trucker rose like a rocket, a
hundred feet into the air, turned end for end, dived head-first to the ground.
He struck with crushing force, pulping his head, his shoulders. But as if
Nollinrude were not yet satisfied, the bar of iron rose and beat the limp body
with enormous savage strokes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Had Nollinrude been less anguished
by the pain of his legs he would have been more wary. Almost as the trucker
struck the ground, Geskamp seized a laborer's mattock, stalked close behind,
swung. The Telek collapsed to the ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now,&quot; said Shorn to
himself, &quot;there will be hell to pay.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp stood panting, looking
down at the body huddled in the finery that suddenly seemed not chosen human
vestments, but the gaudy natural growth of a butterfly or flash-beetle in
pathetic disarray. He became aware of the mattock he still held, flung it away as
if it were red-hot, and stood wiping his hands nervously together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn knelt beside the body,
searched with practiced swiftness. He found and pocketed a wallet, a small
pouch, then rose to his feet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We've got to work
fast.&quot; He looked around the yard. Possibly half a dozen men had witnessed
the occurrence—a tool-room attendant, a form foreman, a couple of time-clerks,
a laborer or two. &quot;Get them all together, everyone who saw what happened;
I'll take care of the body. Here, you!&quot; He called to a white-faced lift
operator. &quot;Get a hopper down here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They rolled the gorgeous hulk into
the hopper. Shorn jumped up beside the operator, pointed. &quot;Up there where
they're pouring that abutment.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They swept diagonally up the great
north wall, to where a pour-crew worked beside a receptor designed to receive
concrete from loaded hoppers. Shorn jumped four feet from the hopper to the
deck, went to the foreman. &quot;There's a hold-up here; take your crew down to
B-142 Pilaster and work there for a while.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The foreman grumbled, protested.
The receptor was half-full of concrete. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn raised his voice
impatiently. &quot;Leave it set. I'll send a lift up to move the whole
thing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The foreman turned away, barked
ill-naturedly to his men. They moved with exaggerated slowness. Shorn stood
tautly while they gathered their equipment and trooped down the ramp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He turned to the lift operator.
&quot;Now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The bedizened body rolled into the
pour. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn guided the dump-hose into
position, pulled the trigger. Gray slush pressed down the staring face that had
known so much power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn sighed slightly.
&quot;That's good. Now—we'll get the crew back on the job.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At Pilaster B-142 Shorn signaled
the foreman, who glowered belligerently. Shorn was a mere draftsman, therefore
a fumbler and impractical. &quot;You can go back to work up above now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Before the foreman could find
words for an adequate retort, Shorn was back in the hopper. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>In the yard he found Geskamp
standing at the center of an apprehensive group. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nollinrude's gone.&quot; He
looked at the body of the trucker who had caused the original outburst.
&quot;Somebody will have to take him home.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He surveyed the group, trying to
gauge their strength, and found nothing to reassure him. Eyes shifted sullenly
from his. With an empty feeling in his stomach Shorn knew that the fact of the
killing could not be disposed of as easily as the body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn once more scanned the
surroundings. A great blank wall rose immediately to the east; to the north
were the Alban Hills, to the south the empty Swanscomba Valley. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Probably these few people were
still alone in their knowledge of the killing. He looked from face to face.
&quot;A lot of people to keep a secret. If one of us talks—even to his brother
or his friend, or his wife—then there's no more secret. You all remember
Vernisaw Knerwig?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A nervous mutter assured him that
they did; that their urgent hope was to disassociate themselves from any part
of the current episode. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp's face was working
irritably. Shorn remembered that Geskamp was nominally in charge, and was
possibly sensitive to any usurpation of his authority. &quot;Yes, Mr. Geskamp?
Did you have something to add?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp drew back his heavy lips,
grinning like a big blond dog. With an effort he restrained himself.
&quot;You're doing fine.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn turned back to the others.
&quot;You men are leaving the job now. You won't be questioned by any Teleks.
Naturally they'll know that Nollinrude has disappeared, but I hope they won't
know where. Just in case you are asked—Nollinrude came and went. That's all you
know. Another thing.&quot; He paused weightily. &quot;If any one of us becomes
wealthy and the Teleks become full of knowledge—this person will regret that he
sold his voice.&quot; And he added, as if it were an inconsequential matter, &quot;There's
a group to cope with situations of this sort.&quot; He looked at Geskamp, but
Geskamp kept stonily silent. &quot;Now, I'll get your names—for future
reference. One at a time—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Twenty minutes later a carry-all
floated off toward Tran. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well,&quot; said Geskamp
bitterly, &quot;I'm up to my neck in it now. Is that what you wanted?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I didn't want it this way.
You're in a tough spot. So am I. With luck we'll come through. But—just in
case—tonight we'll have to do what I was leading up to.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp squinted angrily. &quot;Now
I'm to be your cat's-paw. In what?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You can sign a requisition.
You can send a pair of lifts to the explosives warehouse—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp's bushy eyebrows took on
an odd reverse tilt. &quot;Explosives? How much?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A ton of mitrox.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp said in a tone of hushed
respect: &quot;That's enough to blow the stadium ten miles high!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn grinned. &quot;Exactly.
You'd better get that requisition off right now. Then you have the key to the
generator room. Tomorrow the main pile is going in. Tonight you and I will
arrange the mitrox under the piers.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp's mouth hung open.
&quot;But—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Show's dour face became almost
charming. &quot;I know. Wholesale murder. Not sporting. I agree with you. A
sneak attack. I agree. Stealth and sneak attacks and back-stabbing are our
weapons. We don't have any others. None at all.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But—why are you so confident
of bloodshed?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn suddenly exploded in anger.
&quot;Man, get your head up out of the sand. What's our chance of getting every
single one without exception?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp jumped out of the company
airboat assigned to his use, stalked with a set face around the stadium toward
the construction office. Above him rose two hundred feet of sheer concrete,
glowing in the morning sun. In his mind's eye Geskamp saw the dark cartons that
he and Shorn had carried below like moles on the night previous; he still
moving with reluctance and uncertainty, carried only by Shorn's fire and
direction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Now the trap was set. A single
coded radio signal would pulverize the new concrete, fling a molten gout miles
into the air, pound a gigantic blow at the earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp's honest face became taut
as he wrestled with his conscience. Had he been too malleable? Think what a
revenge the Teleks would take for such a disaster! Still, if the Teleks were as
terrible a threat to human freedom as Shorn had half made him believe, then the
mass killing was a deed to be resolutely carried through, like the killing of
dangerous beasts. And certainly the Teleks only paid lip-service to human laws.
His mind went to the death of Forence Nollinrude. In ordinary events there
would be an inquiry. Nollinrude had killed the trucker; Geskatnp, swept by
overwhelming rage and pity, had killed the Telek. At the worst a human court
would have found him guilty of manslaughter, and no doubt have granted
probation. But with a Telek—Geskamp's blood chilled in his veins. Maybe there
was something to Shorn's extreme methods after all; certainly the Teleks could
be controlled by no normal methods of law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He rounded the corner of the tool
room, noted an unfamiliar face within. Good. Home office had acted without
inquisitiveness; the shifting of employees had interested no one with authority
to ask questions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He looked into the expediter's
room. &quot;Where's the draftsman?&quot; he asked Cole, the steel detailer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Never showed up this
morning, Mr. Geskamp.&quot; Geskamp cursed under his breath. Just like Shorn,
getting him into trouble, then ducking out, leaving him to face it. Might be
better to come clean with the whole incident; after all it had been an
accident, a<i> </i>fit of blood-rage. The Teleks could understand so much,
surely. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He turned his head. Something
flickered at the edge of his vision. He looked sharply. Something like a big
black bug whisked up behind a shelf of books. Big cockroach, thought Geskamp. A
peculiar cockroach. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He attacked his work in a vicious
humor, and foremen around the job asked themselves wonderingly what had got
into Geskamp. Three times during the morning he looked into the office for
Shorn, but Shorn had made no appearance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>And once, as he ducked under a low
soffit on one of the upper decks, a black object darted up behind him. He
jerked his eyes around, but the thing had disappeared under the beams. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Funny bug,&quot; he said to
the new form foreman, whom he was showing around the job. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I didn't see it, Mr.
Geskamp.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp returned to the office,
obtained Shorn's home address—a hotel in the Marmion Tower—and put in a
visiphone call. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn was not in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp turned away, almost bumped
into the feet of a Telek standing in the air before him: a thin somber man with
silver hair and oil-back eyes. He wore two tones of gray, with a sapphire clasp
at the collar of his cape, and the usual Telek slippers of black velvet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp's heart started thudding;
this hands became moist. The moment he had been dreading. Where was Shorn? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You are Geskamp?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Geskamp.
&quot;I—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He was picked up, hurled through
the air. Far, fleeting below, went the stadium, Swanscomba Valley, the entire
countryside. Tran was a gray and black honeycomb, he was in the sunny upper
air, hurtling with unthinkable speed. Wind roared past in his ears, but he felt
no pressure on his skin, no tear at his clothes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The ocean spread blue below, and
something glittered ahead—a complex edifice of shiny metal, glass and bright
color. It floated high in the sunny air, with no support above or below. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp saw a glitter, a flash; he
was standing on a floor of glass threaded and drawn with strands of green and
gold. The thin gray man sat behind a table in a yellow chair. The room was
flooded with sunlight; Geskamp was too dazed to notice further details. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Telek said, &quot;Geskamp,
tell me what you know of Forence Nollinrude.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It appeared to Geskamp that the
Telek was watching him with superior knowledge, as if any lie would be
instantly known, dismissed with grim humor. He was a poor liar to begin with.
He looked around for a place to rest his big body. A chair appeared. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nollinrude?&quot; He seated
himself. &quot;I saw him yesterday. What about him?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Where is he now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp forced a painful laugh.
&quot;How would I know?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A sliver of glass darted through
the air, stung the back of Geskamp's neck. He rose to his feet, startled and
angry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sit down,&quot; said the
Telek, in a voice of unnatural coolness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp slowly sat down. A kind of
faintness dimmed his vision, his brain seemed to move away, seemed to watch
dispassionately. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Where is Nollinrude?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp held his breath. A voice
said, &quot;He's dead. Down in the concrete.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Who killed him?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Geskamp listened to hear what the
voice would say. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>III.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn sat in a quiet tavern in
that section of Tran where the old suddenly changes to the new. South were the
sword-shaped towers, the neat intervening plazas and parks; north spread the
ugly crust of three- and four-story apartments gradually blending into the
industrial district. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A young woman with straight brown
hair sat across the table from Shorn. She wore a brown cloak without ornament;
looking into her face there was little to notice but her eyes—large,
brown-black, somber; the rest of her face was without accent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn was drinking strong tea, his
thin dark face in repose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The young woman seemed to see an
indication that the surface calm was false. She put out her hand, rested it on
his, a quick exquisite gesture, the first time she had touched him in the three
months of their acquaintance. &quot;How could you have done differently?&quot;
Her voice became mildly argumentative. &quot;What could you have done?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Taken the whole half-dozen
underground. Kept Geskamp with me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How would that have helped?
There'll be a certain number of deaths, a certain amount of destruction—how
many and how much is out of our hands. Is Geskamp a valuable man?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. He's a big hard-working
likable fellow, hardly devious or many-tracked enough to be of use. And I don't
think he would have come with me. He was to the point of open rebellion as it
was—the type who resents infringement.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's not impossible that
your arrangements are effective.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not a chance. The only matter
for speculation is how many the Teleks destroy and whom.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The young woman relaxed somberly
hack in her chair, stared straight ahead. &quot;If nothing else, this episode
marks a new place in the ... in the . . . I don't know what to call it.
Struggle? Campaign? War?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Call it war.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We're almost out in the
open. Public opinion may be aroused, swung to our side.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shook his head gloomily.
&quot;The Teleks have bought most of the police, and I suspect that they own
the big newspapers, through fronts of course. No, we can't expect much public
support yet. We'll be called Nihilists, Totalitarists—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The young woman quoted Turgenev.
&quot;If you want to annoy an opponent thoroughly or even harm him, you
reproach him with every defect or vice you are conscious of in yourself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's just as well.&quot;
Shorn laughed bitterly. &quot;Perhaps it's one of our big advantages, our
freedom to merge into the masses. If everyone were anti-Telek, the Teleks would
have an easy job. Kill everybody.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Then they'd have to do all
their own work.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's right, too.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She made a fluttering gesture, her
voice was strained. &quot;It's a blood penance on our century, on
humanity—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn snorted.
&quot;Mysticism.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She went on as if she had not
heard. &quot;If men were to develop from sub-apes a thousand times—each of
those thousand rises would show the same phases, and there would be a Telek
phase in all of them. It's as much a part of humanity as hunger and fear and sex.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And when the Teleks are out
of the way—what's the next phase? Is history only a series of bloody phases?
Where's the leveling-off point?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She smiled wanly. &quot;Perhaps
when we're all Teleks.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn gave her a strange
look—calculation, curiosity, wonder. He returned to his tea as if to practical
reality. &quot;I suppose Geskamp has been trying to get hold of me all
morning.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He considered a moment, then rose
to his feet. &quot;I'll call the job and find out what's happened.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A moment later he returned.
&quot;Geskamp's nowhere around. A message just came in for me at the hotel, and
it's to be delivered by hand only.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps Geskamp went of his
own accord.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;More likely—&quot; she
paused. &quot;Anyway, the hotel is a good place to stay away from.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn clenched and unclenched his
hands. &quot;It frightens me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What?&quot; She seemed
surprised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;My own—vindictiveness. It's
not right to hate anyone. A person is bad because exterior forces have hurt his
essentially good brain. I realize this—and yet I hate.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The Teleks?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, not the Teleks.&quot; He
spoke slowly. &quot;I fear them, good healthy fear. I kill them for survival.
Those I <i>want </i>to kill, for pleasure, are the men who serve the Teleks for
money, who sell their own kind.&quot; He clenched, unclenched his hands. &quot;It's
unhealthy to think like that.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You're too much the
idealist, Will.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn mused, talking in a
monotone. &quot;Our war is the war of ants against giants. They have the power
but they loom, we see them for miles. We're among the swarm. We move a hundred feet,
into a new group of people, we're lost. Anonymity, that's our advantage. So
we're safe—until a Judas-ant identifies us, drags us forth from the swarm. Then
we're lost; the giant foot comes down, there's no escape. We—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The young woman raised her hand.
&quot;Listen.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A voice from the sound-line, here
running under the ceiling molding, said, &quot;The murder of a Telek, Forence
Nollinrude, liaison lieutenant, by subversive conspiracy has been announced.
The murderer, Ian Geskamp, superintendent of construction at the Swanscomba
Valley Stadium, has disappeared. It is expected that he will implicate a number
of confederates when captured.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn sat quietly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What will they do if they
catch him? Will they turn him over to the authorities?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn nodded. &quot;They've
announced the murder. If they want to maintain the fiction of their
subservience to Federal law, then they've got to submit to the regular courts.
Once he's out of their direct custody, then no doubt he'll die—any one of a
number of unpleasant deaths. And then there will be further acts of God.
Another meteor, into Geskamp's home town, something of the sort—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why are you smiling?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It just occurred to me that
Geskamp's home town was Cobent Village, that used to be in Swanscomba Valley.
They've already wiped that one off the map. But they'll do something
significant enough to point up the moral—that killing Teleks is a very
expensive process.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's odd that they bother
with legality at all.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It means that they want no
sudden showdown. Whatever revolution there is to be, they want it to come
gradually, with as little dislocation as possible, no sudden flood of annoying
administrative detail.&quot; He sat tapping his fingers nervously.
&quot;Geskamp was a good fellow. I'm wondering about this message at the
hotel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If he were captured,
drugged, your name and address would come out. You would be a valuable
captive.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not while I can bite down on
my back tooth. Full of cyanide. But I'm curious about that message. If it's
from Geskamp he needs help, and we should help him. He knows about the mitrox
under the stadium. The subject might not arise during the course of
questioning, especially under drugs, but we don't want to run the risk.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Suppose it's a trick?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well—we might learn
something.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I could get it,&quot; she
said doubtfully. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn frowned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I
don't mean by walking in and asking for it; that would be foolish. You write a
note authorizing delivery of the message to bearer.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The young woman said to the boy,
&quot;It's very important that you follow instructions exactly.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, miss.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The boy rode the sidewalk to the
Marmion Tower, whose seventh and eighth floors were given to the Cort Hotel. He
rode the lift to the seventh floor, went quietly to the desk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Mr. Shorn sent me to pick up
his mail.&quot; He passed the note across the desk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The clerk hesitated, looked away
in preoccupation, then without words handed the boy an envelope. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The boy returned to the ground
floor, walked out into the street, where he paused, waited. Apparently no one
followed him. He rode the sidewalk north, along the gray streets to the
Tarrogat, stepped around the corner, jumped on the high-speed East Division
sidewalk. Heavy commercial traffic growled through the street beside him,
trucks and drays, a few surface cars. The boy spied a momentary gap, stepped to
the outside band, jumped running into the street. He darted across, climbed on
the sidewalk running in the opposite direction, watching over his shoulder. No
one followed. He rode a mile, past the Flatiron Y, turned into Grant Avenue,
jumped to the stationary, crouched by the corner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>No one came hurrying after. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He crossed the street, entered the
Grand Maison Café. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The food panel made an island down
the center; to either side were tables. The boy walked around the food panel,
ignoring a table where a young woman in a brown cloak sat by herself. He ducked
out an entrance opposite to where he entered, rounded the building, entered
once more. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The young woman rose to her feet,
followed him out. At the exit they brushed together accidentally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The boy went about his business,
and the young woman turned, went back to the rest room. As she opened the door
a black beetle buzzed through with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She ducked, looked around the
ceiling, but the insect had disappeared. She went to a visiphone, paid for
sonic, dialed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I've got it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Anyone follow?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. I watched him leave
Marmion Tower. I watched behind him in—&quot; her voice broke off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She said in a strained voice,
&quot;Get out of there fast. Hurry. Don't ask questions. Get away—fast!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She hung up, pretending that she
had not noticed the black bug pressed against the glass, crystal eyes staring
at the visiphone dial. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She reached in her pouch, selected
one of the four weapons she carried, drew it forth, closed her eyes, snapped
the release. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>White glare flooded the room,
seared behind her closed lids. She ran out the door, picked up the dazed bug in
her handkerchief, stuffed it into her pouch. It was strangely heavy, like a
slug of lead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She must hurry. She ran from the
rest room, up through the café, out into the street. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Safe among the crowds she watched
six emergency vans vomit Black and Golds who rushed to the exits of the Grand
Maison Café. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Bitterly she rode the sidewalks
north. The Teleks controlled the police, it was no secret. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She wondered about the beetle in
her pouch. It evinced no movement, no sign of life. If her supposition were
correct, it would be quiet so long as she kept light from its eyes, so long as
she denied it reference points. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>For an hour she wandered the city,
intent on evading not only men, but also little black beetle-things. At last
she ducked into a narrow passageway in the hard industry quarter, ran up a
flight of wooden steps, entered a drab but neat sitting room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She went to a closet, found a
small canister with a screw top, gingerly pushed the handkerchief and the
beetle-thing inside, screwed down the lid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She removed her long brown cloak,
drew a cup of coffee from the dispenser, waited. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Half an hour passed. The door
opened. Shorn looked in. His face was haggard and pale as a dog skull; his eyes
glowed with an unhealthy yellow light. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She jumped to her feet.
&quot;What's happened?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sit still, Laurie, I'm all
right.&quot; He slumped into a seat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She drew another cup of coffee,
passed it to him. &quot;What happened?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>His eyes burned brighter. &quot;As
soon as I heard from you, I left the tavern. Twenty seconds later—no more —the
place exploded. Flame shooting out the door, out the windows—thirty or forty
people inside; I can hear them yelling now—&quot; His mouth sagged. He licked
his lips. &quot;I hear them—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie controlled her voice.
&quot;Just ants.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn assented with a ghastly
grin. &quot;The giant steps on forty ants, but the guilty ant, the marked ant,
the intended ant—he's gone.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She told him about the black bug.
He groaned ironically. &quot;It was bad enough dodging spies and Black and
Golds. Now little bugs—can it hear?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't know. I suppose so.
It's shut up tight in the can, but sound probably gets through.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We'd better move it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She wrapped the can in a towel,
tucked it in a closet, shut the door. When she returned, Shorn was eying her
with a new look in his eye. &quot;You thought very swiftly, Laurie.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She turned away to hide her
pleasure. &quot;I had to.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You still have the
message?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She handed the envelope across the
table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He read, &quot;Get in touch with
Clyborn at the Perendalia.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Do you know him?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. We'll make discreet
inquiries. I don't imagine there'll be anything good come out of it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's so much—work.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Easy for the giants. One or
two of them manage the entire project. I've heard that the one called Dominion
is in charge, and the others don't even realize there's dissatisfaction. Just
as we appoint a dogcatcher, then dismiss the problem of stray dogs from our
minds. Probably not one Telek in a hundred realizes that we're fighting for our
lives, our futures, our dignity as human beings.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>After a moment she asked, &quot;Do
you think we'll win, Will?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't know. We have
nothing to lose.&quot; He yawned, stretched. &quot;Tonight I meet Circumbright;
you remember him?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;He's the chubby little
biophysicist.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn nodded. &quot;If you'll
excuse me, I think I'll take a nap.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>IV.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At eleven o'clock Shorn descended
to the street. The sky was bright with glow from the lake-shore entertainment
strip, the luxury towers of downtown Tran. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He walked along the dark street
till he came to Bellman Boulevard, and stepped out onto the slipway. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There was a cold biting wind and
few people were abroad; the hum of the rollers below was noticeable. He turned
into Stockbridge Street, and as he approached the quarter-mile strip of night
stores, the sidewalks became crowded and Shorn felt more secure. He undertook a
few routine precautions, sliding quickly through doors, to break contact with
any spy-beetles that might have fixed on him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At midnight the fog blew thick in
from the harbor, smelling of oil, mercaptan, ammonia. Pulling up his hood,
Shorn descended a flight of stairs, pushed into a basement recreation hall,
sidled past the dull-eyed men at the mechanical games. He walked directly
toward the men's room, turned at the last minute into a short side corridor,
passed through a door marked &quot;Employees&quot; into a workshop littered
with bits and parts from the amusement machines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn waited a moment, ears alert
for sound, then went to the rear of the room, unlocked a steel door, slipped
through into a second workshop, much more elaborately fitted than the first. A
short stout man with a big head and mild blue eyes looked up. &quot;Hello,
Will.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn waved his hand. &quot;Hello,
Gorman.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He stood with his back to the
door, looking around the molding for a black, apparently innocent, beetle.
Nothing in sight. He crossed the room, scribbled on a bit of paper. &quot;We've
got to search the room. Look for a flying spy cell, like this.&quot; He
sketched the beetle he carried with him in the canister, then appended a
postscript. &quot;I'll cover the ventilator.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>An hour's search revealed nothing.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn sighed, relaxed.
&quot;Ticklish. If there was one of the things here, and it saw us searching,
the Telek at the other end would have known the jig was up. We'd have been in
trouble. A fire, an explosion. They missed me once already today, by about ten
seconds.&quot; He set the canister on a bench. &quot;I've got one of the things
in here. Laurie caught it; rare presence of mind. Her premise is, that if its
eyes and ears are made useless—in other words, if it loses its identity on a
spatial frame of reference—then it ceases to exist for the Teleks, and they can
no longer manipulate it. I think she's right; the idea seems intuitively
sound.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Gorman Circumbright picked up the
canister, jiggled it. &quot;Rather heavy. Why did you bring it down here?&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We've got to figure out a
counter to it. It must function like a miniature video transmitter. I suppose
Alvac Corporation makes them. If we can identify the band it broadcasts on, we
can build ourselves detectors, warning units.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright sat looking at the
can. &quot;If it's still in operation, if it's still broadcasting, I can find
out very swiftly.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He set the can beside an all-wave
tuner. Shorn unscrewed the lid, gingerly removed the bug, still wrapped in
cloth, set it on the bench. Circumbright pointed to a fluorescent scale,
glowing at several points. He started to speak, but Shorn motioned for silence,
pointed to the bug. Circumbright nodded, wrote, &quot;The lower lines are
possibly static, from the power source. The sharp line at the top is the broadcast
frequency—very sharp. Powerful.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn replaced the bug in the can.
Circumbright turned away from the tuner. &quot;If it's insensitive to infrared,
we can see to take it apart, disconnect the power.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn frowned doubtfully.
&quot;How could we be sure?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Give it to me.&quot;
Circumbright clipped leads from an oscillograph to the back of the tuner,
dialed to the spy-beetle's carrier frequency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The oscillograph showed a normal
sine-curve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now. Turn out the
lights.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn threw the switch. The room
was dark except for the dancing yellow-green light of the oscillograph and the
dull red murk from the infrared projector. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright's bulk cut off the
glow from the projector; Shorn watched the oscillograph face. There was no
change in the wave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good,&quot; said Circumbright.
&quot;And I think that if I strain my eyes I can ... or better, reach in the
closet and hand me the heat-conversion lenses. Top shelf.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He worked fifteen minutes, then
suddenly the carrier wave on the face of the oscillograph vanished.
&quot;Ah,&quot; sighed Circumbright. &quot;That's got it. You can turn the
lights back on now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Together they stood looking down
at the bug—a little black torpedo two inches long with two crystalline eyes
bulging at each side of the head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nice job,&quot; said
Circumbright. &quot;It's an Alvac product all right. I'll say a word to
Graythorne; maybe he can introduce a few disturbing factors.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What about that detector
unit?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright pursed his lips.
&quot;For each of the bugs there's probably a different frequency; otherwise
they'd get their signals mixed up. But the power bank probably radiates about
the same in all cases. I can fix up a jury-rig which you can use for a few
days, then Graythorne can bring us down some tailor-made jobs from Alvac, using
the design data.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He crossed the room, found a
bottle of red wine, which he sat beside Shorn. &quot;Relax a few minutes.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Half an hour passed. Shorn watched
quietly while Circumbright soldered together stock circuits, humming in a
continuous tuneless drone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There,&quot; said
Circumbright finally. &quot;If one of those bugs gets within a hundred yards,
this will vibrate, thump.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good.&quot; Shorn tucked the
device tenderly in his breast pocket, while Circumbright settled himself into
an armchair, stuffed tobacco in a pipe. Shorn watched him curiously.
Circumbright, placid and unemotional as a man could be, revealed himself to
Shorn by various small signs, such as pressing the tobacco home with a thumb
more vigorous than necessary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I hear another Telek was
killed yesterday.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes. I was there.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Who is this Geskamp?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Big blond fellow. What's the
latest on him?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;He's dead.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hum-m-m.&quot; Shorn was
silent a moment, a sick feeling at the pit of his stomach. &quot;How?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The Teleks turned him over
to the custody of the Federal Marshal at Knoll. He was shot trying to escape.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn felt as if anger were being
pumped inside him, as if he were swelling, as if the pressure against his taut
muscles were too great to bear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Take it easy,&quot; said
Circumbright mildly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'll kill Teleks from a
sense of duty,&quot; said Shorn. &quot;I don't enjoy it. But . . . and I feel
ashamed, I'll admit . . . I <i>want </i>to kill the Federal Marshal at
Knoll.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It wasn't the Federal
Marshal himself,&quot; said Circumbright. &quot;It was two of his deputies. And
it's always possible that Geskamp actually did try to escape. We'll know for
sure tomorrow.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How so?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We're moving out a little
bit. There'll be an example made of those two if they're guilty. We'll
narcotize them tonight, find out the truth. If they're working for the
Teleks—they'll go.&quot; Circumbright spat on the floor. &quot;Although I
dislike the label of a terrorist organization.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What else can we do? If we
got a confession, turned them over to the Section Attorney, they'd be
reprimanded, turned loose.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;True enough.&quot;
Circumbright puffed meditatively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn moved restlessly in his
chair. &quot;It frightens me, the imminence, the urgency of all this—and how
few, people are aware of it! Surely there's never been an emergency so
ill-publicized before. In a week, a month, three months—there'll be more dead
people on Earth than live ones, unless we get the entire shooting-match at once
in the stadium.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright puffed at his pipe.
&quot;Will, sometimes I wonder whether we're not approaching the struggle from
the wrong direction.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How so?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps instead of attacking
the Teleks, we should be learning more of the fundamental nature of
telekinetics.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn leaned back fretfully.
&quot;The Teleks don't know themselves.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A bird can't tell you much
about aerodynamics. The Teleks have a disadvantage which is not at all obvious
—the fact that action comes too easy, that they are under no necessity to
think. To build a dam, they look at a mountain, move it down into the valley.
If the dam gives way, they move down another mountain, but they never look at a
slide rule. In this respect, at least, they represent a retrogression rather
than an advance.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn slowly opened and closed his
hands, watching as if it were the first time he had ever seen them.
&quot;They're caught in the stream of life, like the rest of us. It's part of
the human tragedy that there can't be any compromise; it's them or us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright heaved a deep sigh.
&quot;I've racked my brains . . . Compromise. Why can't two kinds of people
live together? Our abilities complement each other.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;One time it was that way.
The first generation. The Teleks were still common men, perhaps a little
peculiar in that things always turned out lucky for them. Then Joffrey and his
Telekinetic Congress, and the reinforcing, the catalysis, the forcing, whatever
it was—and suddenly they're different.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If there were no
fools,&quot; said Circumbright, &quot;either among us or among them, we could
co-inhabit the earth. There's the flaw in any compromise negotiation—the fact
of fools, both among the Teleks and the common men.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't quite follow
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright gestured with his
pipe. &quot;There will always be Telek fools to antagonize common-man fools;
then the common-man fools will ambush the Teleks, and the Teleks will be very
upset, especially since for every Telek, there are forty Earth fools eager to
kill him. So they use force, terror. Inexorable, inevitable. But—they have a
choice. They can leave Earth, find a home somewhere among the planets they
claim they visit; they can impose this reign of power; or they can return to
humanity, renounce telekinesis entirely. Those are the choices open to
them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And our choices?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We submit or we challenge.
In the first instance we become slaves. In the second we either kill the
Teleks, drive them away, or we all become dead men.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn sipped at his wineglass.
&quot;We might all become Teleks ourselves.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Or we might find a
scientific means to control or cancel out telekinesis.&quot; Circumbright
poured a careful finger of wine for himself. &quot;My own instinct is to
explore the last possibility.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There's nowhere to get a
foothold in the subject.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh I don't know. We have a
number of observations. Telekinesis and teleportation have been known for
thousands of years. It took the concentration of telekinetics at Joffrey's
Congress to develop the power fully. We know that Telek children are
telekinetic—whether by contagion or by genetics we can't be sure.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Probably both. A genetic
predisposition; parental training.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright nodded.
&quot;Probably both. Although as you know, in rare instances they reward a
common man by making a Telek out of him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Evidently telekinesis is
latent in everyone.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There's a large literature
of early experiments and observations. The so-called spiritualist study of
poltergeists and house-demons might be significant.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn remained silent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I've tried to systematize
the subject,&quot; Circumbright continued, &quot;deal with it logically. The
first question seems to be, does the Law of Conservation of Energy apply or
not? When a Telek floats a ton of iron across the sky by looking at it, is he
creating energy or is he directing the use of energy from an unseen source?
There is no way of knowing offhand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn stretched, yawned, settled
back in his chair. &quot;I have heard a metaphysical opinion, to the effect
that the Telek uses nothing more than confidence. The universe that he
perceives has reality only to the backdrop of his own brain. He sees a chair;
the image of a chair exists in his mind. He orders the chair to move across the
room. His confidence and reality is so great that, in his mind, he believes he
sees the chair move, and he bases his future actions on the perception. Somehow
he is not disappointed. In other words, the chair has moved because he believes
he has moved it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright puffed placidly on
his pipe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn grinned. &quot;Go on; I'm
sorry I interrupted you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Where does the energy come
from? Is the mind a source, a valve or a remote control? There are the three
possibilities. Force is applied; the mind directs the force. But does the force
<i>originate </i>in the mind, is the force <i>collected, channeled through </i>the
mind, or does the mind act like a modulator, a grid in a vacuum tube?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn slowly shook his head.
&quot;So far we have not even defined the type of energy at work. If we knew
that, we might recognize the function of the mind.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Or vice versa. It works
either way. But if you wish, consider the force at work. In all cases, an object
moves in a single direction. That is to say, there has been no observed case of
an explosion or a compression. The object moves as a unit. How? Why? To say the
mind projects a force field is ignoring the issue, redefining at an equal level
of abstraction.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps the mind is able to
control the poltergeists —creatures like the old Persian genii.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright tapped the ash from
his pipe. &quot;I've considered the possibility. Who are the poltergeists?
Ghosts? Souls of the dead? A matter for speculation. Why are the Teleks able to
control them, and ordinary people not?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn grinned. &quot;I assume
these are rhetorical questions—because I don't have the answers.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps a form of gravity is
at work. Imagine a cup-shaped gravity screen around the object, open on the
side the Telek desires motion. I have not calculated the gravitational
acceleration generated by matter at its average universal density, from here to
infinity, but I assume it would be insignificant. A millimeter a day, perhaps.
Count the cup-shaped gravity-screen out; likewise a method for rendering the
object opaque to the passage of neutrinos in a given direction.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Poltergeists, gravity,
neutrinos—all eliminated. What have we left?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright chuckled. &quot;I
haven't eliminated the poltergeists. But I incline to the Organic Theory. That
is, the concept that all the minds and all the matter of the universe are
interconnected, much like brain cells and muscular tissue of the body. When
certain of these brain cells achieve a sufficiently close vinculum, they are
able to control certain twitchings of the corporeal frame of the universe. How?
Why? I don't know. After all, it's only an idea, a sadly anthropomorphic
idea.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn looked thoughtfully up at
the ceiling. Circumbright was a three-way scientist. He not only proposed
theories, he not only devised critical experiments to validate them, but he was
an expert laboratory technician. &quot;Does your theory suggest any practical
application?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright scratched his ear.
&quot;Not yet. I need to cross-fertilize it with a few other notions. Like the
metaphysics you brought up a few moments ago. If I only had a Telek who would
submit himself to experiments, we might get somewhere—And I think I hear Dr.
Kurgill.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He rose to his feet, padded to the
door. He opened it; Shorn saw him stiffen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A deep voice said, &quot;Hello, Circumbright;
this is my son. Cluche, meet Gorman Circumbright, one of our foremost
tacticians.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The two Kurgills came into the
laboratory. The father was short, spare, with simian length to his arms. He had
a comical simian face with a high forehead, long upper lip, flat nose. The son
resembled his father not at all: a striking young man with noble features, a
proud crest of auburn hair, an extreme mode of dress, reminiscent of Telek
style. The elder was quick of movement, talkative, warm; the younger was
careful of eye and movement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright turned toward Shorn.
&quot;Will—&quot; he stopped short. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; he said to the
Kurgills. &quot;If you'll sit down, I'll be with you at once.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He hurried into the adjoining
storeroom. Shorn stood in the shadows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What's the trouble?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn took Circumbright's hand,
held it against the warning unit in his pocket. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright jerked. &quot;The
thing's vibrating!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn looked warily into the room
beyond. &quot;How well do you know the Kurgills?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright said, &quot;The
doctor's my lifelong friend; I'd go my life for him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And his son?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I can't say.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They stared at each other, then by
common accord, looked through the crack of the door. Cluche Kurgil had seated
himself in the chair Shorn had vacated, while his father stood in front of him,
teetering comfortably on his toes, hands behind his back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'd swear that no bug
slipped past us while I stood in the doorway,&quot; muttered Circumbright. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. I don't think it
did.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That means it's on one or
the other of their persons.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It might be unintentional—a
plant. But how would the Teleks know the Kurgills intended to come down
here?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shook his head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright sighed. &quot;I guess
not.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The bug will be where it can
see, but where it can't be seen—or at least, not noticed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Their glances went to the ornate
headdress Cluche Kurgill wore on one side of his head: a soft roll of
gray-green leather, bound by a strip across his hair, trailing a dangle of
moon-opals past his ear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright said in a tight
voice, &quot;We can expect destruction at any time. Explosion—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn said slowly, &quot;I doubt
if they'll send an explosion. If they feel they are unsuspected, they'll prefer
to bide their time.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright said huskily,
&quot;Well, what do you propose then?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn hesitated a moment before
replying. &quot;We're in a devil of a ticklish position. Do you have a
narcohypnotic stinger handy?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright nodded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps then—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Two minutes later Circumbright
rejoined the Kurgilis. The old doctor was in a fine humor. &quot;Gorman,&quot;
he said to Circumbright; &quot;I'm very proud of Cluche here. He's been a
scapegrace all his life—but now he wants to make something of himself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good,&quot; said Circumbright
with hollow heartiness. &quot;If he were of our conviction, I could use him
right now —but I wouldn't want him to do anything against his—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh, no, not at all,&quot;
said Cluche. &quot;What's your problem?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well, Shorn just left for a
very important meeting—the regional chiefs—and he's forgotten his code book. I
couldn't trust an ordinary messenger, but if you will deliver the code book,
you'd be doing us a great service.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Any little thing I can do to
help,&quot; said Cluche. &quot;I'll be delighted.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>His father regarded him with
fatuous pride. &quot;Cluche has surprised me. He caught me out just the day
before yesterday, and now nothing must do but that he plunges in after me.
Needless to say I'm very pleased; glad to see that he's a chip off the old
block, nothing stands in his way.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright said, &quot;I can
count on you then? You'll have to follow instructions exactly.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Quite all right, sir, glad
to help.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good,&quot; said
Circumbright. &quot;First thing then—you'll have to change your clothes. You'd
be too conspicuous as you are.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh, now!&quot; protested
Cluche. &quot;Surely a cloak—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No!&quot; snapped
Circumbright. &quot;You'll have to dress as a dock worker from the skin out. No
cloak would hide that headgear. In the next room you'll find some clothes. Come
with me, I'll make a light.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He held open the door; reluctantly
Cluche stepped through. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The door closed. Shorn expertly
seized Cluche's neck, digging strong fingers into the motor nerves. Cluche
stiffened, trembling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright slapped the front of
his neck with a barbful of drug, then fumbled for Cluche's headdress. He felt a
smooth little object bulging with two eyes like a tadpole. He said easily.
&quot;Can't seem to find the light—&quot; He tucked the bug into his pouch.
&quot;Here it is. Now—your pouch. I'll put it into this locker; it'll be safe
till you get back.&quot; He winked at Shorn, shoved the pouch into a heavy
metal tool chest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They looked down at the sprawled
body. &quot;There's not much time,&quot; said Circumbright. &quot;I'll send Kurgill
home, and we'll have to get out ourselves.&quot; He looked regretfully around
the room. &quot;There's a lot of fine equipment here—we can get more, I
suppose.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn clicked his tongue.
&quot;What will you tell Kurgill?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Um-m-m. The truth would kill
him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Cluche was killed by the
Teleks. He died defending the code book. The Teleks have his name; he'll have
to go underground himself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;He'll have to go under
tonight. I'll warn him to lay low, say in Capistrano's, until we call him, then
we can give him the bad news. As soon as he's gone we'll take Cluche out the
back way, to Laurie's.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cluche Kurgill sat in a chair,
staring into space. Circumbright leaned back smoking his pipe. Laurie, in white
pajamas and a tan robe, lay sidewise on a couch in the corner watching; Shorn
sat beside her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How long have you been
spying for the Teleks, Cluche?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Three days.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Tell us about it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I found some writings of my
father's which led me to believe he was a member of a sub-organization. I
needed money. I reported to a police sergeant who I knew to be interested. He
wanted me to furnish him the details; I refused. I demanded to speak to a
Telek. I threatened the policeman—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What is his name?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sergeant Cagolian Loo, of
the Moxenwohl Precinct.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Go on.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Finally he arranged an
appointment with Adlari Dominion. I met Dominion at the Pequinade, out in
Vireburg. He gave me a thousand crowns and a spy cell which I was to carry with
me at all times. When anything interesting occurred I was to press an attention
button.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What were your
instructions?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I was to become a
conspirator along with my father, accompanying him as much as possible. If my
efforts resulted in the arrest of important figures, he hinted that I might be
made a Telek myself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Did he intimate how his metamorphosis
is accomplished?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>“No.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;When are you to report to
Dominion again?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I 'am to contact him by
visiphone at 2:00 P.M. tomorrow, at Glarietta Pavilion.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Is there any password or
identification code?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Silence held the room for several
minutes. Shorn stirred, rose to his feet. &quot;Gorman—suppose I were to be
metamorphosed, suppose I were to become a Telek.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright chewed placidly on
his pipestem. &quot;It would be a fine thing. I don't quite understand how
you'll manage. Unless,&quot; he added in a dry voice, &quot;you intend to turn
us all in to Adlari Dominion.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. But look at Cluche. Look
at me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright looked, grimaced,
straightened up in his seat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn watched expectantly.
&quot;Could it be done?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh. I see. Give you more
nose, a longer chin, fuller cheeks, a lot of red hair—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And Cluche's clothes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You'd pass.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Especially if I come with
information.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's what is puzzling me.
What kind of information could you give Dominion that would please him but
wouldn't hurt us?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn told him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright puffed on his pipe.
&quot;It's a big decision. But it's a good exchange. Unless he's got the same
thing already, from other sources.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Such as Geskamp? In which
case, we lose nothing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;True.&quot; Circumbright
went to the visiphone. &quot;Tino? Bring your gear over to—&quot; He looked at
Laurie: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What's the address?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;29, 24, 14 Martinvelt.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The red-haired man moved with a
taut wiriness that had not been characteristic of Cluche Kurgill. Laurie
inspected him critically. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Walk slower, Will. Don't
flail your arms so. Cluche was very languid.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Check this.&quot; Shorn
walked across the room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Better.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Very well. I'm gone. Wish me
luck. My first stop is<i> </i>the old workshop for Cluche's spy cell. He'd
hardly be likely to leave it there.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But aren't you taking a
chance, going back to the workshop?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't think so. I hope
not. If the Teleks planned to destroy it, they would have done so last
night.&quot; He waved his hand abruptly and was gone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He rode the sidewalk, aping the
languorous and lofty democracy he associated with Cluche. The morning had been
overcast and blustery, with spatters of cold rain, but at noon the clouds
broke. The sun surged through gaps in the hurrying rack, and the great gray
buildings of Tran stood forth like proud lords. Shorn tilted his head back;
this was the grandeur of simple bulk, but nevertheless impressive. He himself
preferred construction on a smaller scale, buildings to suit a lesser number of
more highly individualized people. He thought of the antique Mediterranean
temples, gaudy in their pinks and green and blues, although now the marble had
bleached white. Such idiosyncrasy was possible, even enforced, in the ancient
monarchies. Today every man, in theory his own master, was required to mesh
with his fellows, like a part in a great gear cluster. The culture-colors and
culture-tones came out at the common denominator, the melange of all colors:
gray. Buildings grew taller and wider from motives of economy—the volume
increased by the cube but the enclosing surface only by the square. The motif
was utilitarianism, mass policy, each tenant relinquishing edges and fringes of
his personality, until only the common basic core—a sound roof, hot and cold
water, good light, air-conditioning, and good elevator service—remained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>People living in masses, thought
Shorn, were like pebbles on a beach, each grinding and polishing his neighbor
until all were absolutely uniform. Color and flair were to be found only in the
wilderness and among the Teleks. Imagine a world populated by Teleks; imagine
the four thousand expanded to four hundred million, four billion! First to go
would be the cities. There would be no more concentrations, no more giant <i>gray
</i>buildings, no directed rivers of men and women. Humanity would explode like
a nova. The cities would corrode and crumble, great mournful hulks, the final
monuments to medievalism. Earth would be too small, too limited. Out to the
planets, where the Teleks claimed to roam at will. Flood Mars with blue oceans,
filter the sky of Venus. Neptune, Uranus, Pluto—call them in, bestow warm new
orbits upon them. Bring in even Saturn, so vast and yet with a surface gravity
only a trifle more than Earth's—But, these great works, suppose they exhausted
the telekinetic energy, wherever it originated? Suppose some morning the Teleks
awoke and found the power gone! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Then—the crystal sky-castles
falling! Food, shelter, warmth needed, and no secure gray cities, no ant-hill
buildings, none of the pedestrian energies of metal and heat and electricity.
Then what calamity! What wailing and cursing! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn heaved a deep sigh.
Speculation. Telekinetic energy might well be infinite. Or it might be at the
point of exhaustion at this moment. Speculation, and not germane to his present
goal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He frowned. Perhaps it was
important. Perhaps some quiet circuit in his mind was at work, aligning him
into new opinions—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ahead was the basement recreation
hall. Shorn guiltily realized that he had been swinging along at his own gait,
quite out of character with the personality of Cluche Kurgill. Best not forget
these details, he told himself guiltily; there would be opportunity for only
one mistake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He descended the stairs, strode
through the hall, past the clicking, glowing, humming game machines, where men,
rebelling at the predictability of their lives, came to buy synthetic adventure
and surprise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He walked unchallenged through the
door marked &quot;Employees&quot;; at the next door he paused, wondering
whether he had remembered to bring the key, wondering if a spy cell might be
hidden in the shadows, watching the door. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>If so, would Cluche Kurgill be
likely to possess a key? It was in the bounds of possibility, he decided, and
in any event would not he interpreted as suspicious. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn groped into his pouch. The
key was there. He opened the door, and assuming the furtive part of a spy,
entered the workshop. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It was as they had left it the
night before. Shorn went quickly to the tool chest, found Circumbright's pouch,
brought forth the bug, set it carefully into his headdress. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Now—get out as fast as possible.
He looked at his watch; Twelve noon. At two, Cluche's appointment with Adlari
Dominion, chief of the Telek Liaison Committee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn ate an uncomfortable lunch
in one corner of the Mercantile Mart Foodarium, a low-ceilinged acreage dotted
with tables precisely as a tile floor, and served by a three-tier display of
food moving slowly under a transparent case. His head itched furiously under the
red toupee, and he dared not scratch lest he disturb Tino's elaborate effort.
Secondly, he decided that the Foodarium, the noon resort of hurried
day-workers, was out of character for Cluche Kurgill. Among the grays and dull
greens and browns, his magnificent Telek-style garments made him appear like a
flamingo in a chicken-run. He felt glances of dull hostility; the Teleks were
envied but respected; one of their own kind aping the Teleks was despised with
the animosity that found no release elsewhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn ate quickly and departed. He
followed Zyke Alley into Multiflores Park, where he sauntered back and forth
among the dusty sycamores. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At two he sat himself deliberately
in a kiosk, dialed Glarietta Pavilion on the visiphone. The connection clicked
home; the screen glowed with a fanciful blackand-white drawing of Glarietta
Pavilion, and a terse man's voice spoke. &quot;Glarietta Pavilion.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I want to speak to Adlari
Dominion; Cluche Kurgill calling.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A thin face appeared, inquisitive,
impertinent, with a lumpy nose, pale-blue eyes set at a birdlike slant.
&quot;What do you want?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn frowned. He had neglected an
important item of information; it would hardly do to ask the man in the
visiphone if he were Adlari Dominion, whom he was supposed to have met three
day previously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I had an appointment for
today at two,&quot; and cautiously he watched the man in the screen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You can report to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No,&quot; said Shorn, now
confident. The man was too pushing, too authoritative. &quot;I want to speak to
Adlari Dominion. What I have to say is not for your ears.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The thin man glared. &quot;I'll be
the judge of that; Dominion can't be bothered every five minutes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If Dominion learns that you
are standing in my way, he will not be pleased.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The thin face flushed red. His
hand swept up, the screen went pale-green. Shorn waited. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The screen lit once more, showing
a bright room with high white walls. Windows opened on sun-dazzled clouds. A
man, thin as the first-to answer the screen, but somber, with gray hair and
oil-black eyes, looked quietly at him. Under the bore of the sharp eyes, Shorn
suddenly felt uneasy. Would his disguise hold up? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well, Kurgill, what do you
have to tell me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's a face-to-face
matter.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hardly wise,&quot; Dominion
commented. &quot;Don't you trust the privacy of the visiphone? I assure you
it's not tapped.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. I trust the visiphone.
But—I stumbled on something big. I want to be sure I get what's coming to
me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh.&quot; Dominion made no
play at misunderstanding. &quot;You've been working—how long?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Three days.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And already you expect the
greatest reward it's in our power to bestow?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's worth it. If I'm a
Telek, it's to my advantage to help you. If I'm not—it isn't. Simple as
that.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion frowned slightly.
&quot;You're hardly qualified to estimate the value of your information.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Suppose I knew of a brain
disease which attacks only Teleks. Suppose I knew that inside of a year half or
three-quarters of the Teleks would be dead?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion's face changed not a
flicker. &quot;Naturally I want to know about it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn made no reply. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion said slowly, &quot;If
such is your information, and we authenticate it, you will be rewarded
suitably.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shook his head. &quot;I
can't take the chance. This is my windfall. I've got to make sure I get what
I'm after; I may not have another chance.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion's mouth tightened, but he
said mildly enough, &quot;I understand your viewpoint.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I want to come up to the
Pavilion. But a word of warning to you; there's no harm in clear understanding
between friends.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;None whatever.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Don't try drugs on me. I've
got a cyanide capsule in my mouth. I'll kill myself before you get something
for nothing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion smiled grimly. &quot;Very
well, Kurgill. Don't execute yourself, swallow it by mistake.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn smiled likewise. &quot;Only
as a gesture of protest. How shall I come up to Glarietta?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hire a cab.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Openly?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why not?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You're not afraid of counter
espionage?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion's eyes narrowed; his head
tilted slightly, &quot;I thought we discussed that at our previous
meeting.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn took care not to protest his
recollection too vehemently. &quot;Very well. I'll be right up.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Glarietta Pavilion floated high
above the ocean, a fairy-book cloud-castle—shining white terraces, ranked towers
with parasol roofs, gardens verdant with foliage and vines trailing down into
the air. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The cab slid down on a landing
fiat. Shorn alighted. The driver looked at him without favor. &quot;Want me to
wait?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, you can go.&quot; Shorn
thought wryly, he'd either be leaving under his own power or not be leaving at
all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A door slid back before him; he
entered a hall walled with russet orange, purple and green prisms, glowing in
the brilliant upper air light. In a raised alcove sat a young woman, a
beautiful creature with glossy butter-colored hair, a cream-smooth face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir?&quot; she asked,
impersonally courteous. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I want to see Adlari
Dominion. I'm Cluche Kurgill.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She touched a key below her.
&quot;To your right.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He climbed a glass staircase which
spiraled up a green glass tube, came out in a waiting room walled with
gold-shot red rock that had never been quarried on Earth. Dark-green ivy veiled
one wall; white columns opposite made a graceful frame into a herbarium full of
green light and lush green growth, white and scarlet flowers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn hesitated, looked around
him. A golden light blinked in the wall, an aperture appeared. Adlari Dominion
stood in the opening. &quot;Come in, Kurgill.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn stepped into the wash of
light, and for a moment lost Dominion in the dazzle. When vision returned,
Dominion was lounging in a hammock-chair supported by a glistening rod
protruding horizontally from the wall. A red leather ottoman was the only other
article of furniture visible. Three of the walls were transparent glass, giving
on a magnificent vista: clouds bathed in sunlight, blue sky, blue sea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion pointed to the ottoman.
&quot;Have a seat.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The ottoman was only a foot high;
sitting in it Shorn would be forced to crane his neck to see Dominion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, thanks. I prefer to
stand.&quot; He put a foot on the ottoman, inspected Dominion cooly, eye to
eye. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion said evenly, &quot;What
do you have to tell me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn started to speak, but found
it impossible to look into the smoldering black eyes and think at the same
time. He turned his eyes out the window to a pinnacle of white cloud.
&quot;I've naturally considered this situation carefully. If you've done the
same . . . as I imagine you have . . . then there's no point in each of us trying
to outwit the other. I have information that's important, critically important
to a great number of Teleks. I want to trade this information for Telek
status.&quot; He glanced toward Dominion whose eyes had never faltered, looked
away once more. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm trying to arrange this
statement with absolute clarity, so there'll be complete understanding between
us. First, I want to remind you, I have poison in my mouth. I'll kill myself
before I part with what I know, and I guarantee you'll never have another chance
to learn what I can tell you.&quot; Shorn glanced earnestly sidewise at
Dominion. &quot;No hypnotic drug can act fast enough to prevent me from biting
open my cyanide—Well, enough of that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Second: I can't trust any
verbal or written contract you make; if I accepted such a contract I'd have no
means to enforce it. You are in a stronger position. If you deliver your part
of the bargain, and I fail to deliver my part, you can still arrange that I be
. . . well, penalized. Therefore, to demonstrate your good faith, you must make
delivery before I do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;In other words, make me a
Telek. Then I'll tell you what I know.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion sat staring at him a full
thirty seconds. Then he said softly, &quot;Three days ago Cluche Kurgill was
not so rigorous.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Three days ago, Cluche
Kurgill did not know what he knows now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion said abruptly, &quot;I
cannot argue with your exposition. If I were you, in your position, I would
make the same stipulation. However&quot;—he looked Shorn keenly up and
down—&quot;three days ago I would have considered you an undesirable
adjunct.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn assumed a lofty expression.
&quot;Judging from the Teleks I have known, I would not have assumed you to be
so critical.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You talk past your
understanding,&quot; said Dominion crisply. &quot;Do you think that men like
Nollinrude, for instance, who was just killed, are typical of the Teleks? Do
you think that we are all careless of our destiny?&quot; His mouth twisted
contemptuously. &quot;There are forces at work which you do not know of,
tremendous patterns laid out for the future. But enough; these are high-level
ideas.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He floated clear of his chair,
lowered to the floor. &quot;I agree to your stipulation. Come with me, we'll
get it over with. You see, we are not inflexible; we can move swiftly and
decisively when we wish.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He led Shorn back into the green
glass tube, jerked himself to the upper landing, watched impatiently while
Shorn circled up the steps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Come.&quot; He stepped out
on a wide white terrace bathed in afternoon sunlight, went directly to a low
table on which rested a cubical block of marble. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He reached into a cabinet under
the table, pulled out a small speaker, spoke into the mesh. &quot;The top two
hundred to Glarietta Pavilion.&quot; He turned back to Shorn. &quot;Naturally
there'll be certain matters you must familiarize yourself with.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;In order to become a Telek,
you mean?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, no,&quot; snapped
Dominion. &quot;That's a simple mechanical matter. Your perspective must be
adjusted; you'll be living with a new orientation toward life.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I had no idea it was quite
so involved.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There's a great deal you
don't understand.&quot; He motioned brusquely. &quot;Now to business. Watch
that marble block on the table. Think of it as part yourself, controlled by
your own nervous impulses. No, don't look around; fix on the marble block. I'll
stand here.&quot; He took a place near the table. &quot;When I point to the
left, move it to the left; when I point to the right, move it to the right.
Mind now, the cube is part of your organism, part of your flesh, like your
hands and feet.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There was murmuring and a rustle
behind Shorn; obedient to Dominion he fastened his eyes on the cube.
&quot;Now.&quot; Dominion pointed to the left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn willed the cube to the left.
&quot;The cube is part of you,&quot; said Dominion. &quot;Your own body.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn felt a cool tremor at his
skin. The cube moved to the left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion pointed to right. Shorn
willed the cube to the right. The tingling increased. It was as if he were
gradually finding himself immersed in cool carbonated water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Left. Right. Left. Right. The cube
seemed to be nearer to him, though be had not moved. As near as his own hand.
His mind seemed to break through a tough sphincter into a new medium, cool and
wide; he saw the world in a sudden new identity, something part of himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion stepped away from the
table; Shorn was hardly conscious that he no longer made directive gestures. He
moved the cube right, left, raised it six feet into the air, twenty feet, sent
it circling high around the sky. As he followed it with his eyes, he became
aware of Teleks standing silently behind him, watching expressionlessly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He brought the cube back to the
table. Now he knew how to do it. He lifted himself into the air, moved across
the terrace, set himself down. When he looked around the Teleks had gone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion wore a cool smile.
&quot;You take hold with great ease.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It seems natural enough.
What is the function of the others, the Teleks behind on the terrace?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion shrugged. &quot;We know
little of the actual mechanism. At the beginning, of course, I helped you move
the cube, as did the others. Gradually we let our minds rest, and you did it
all.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn stretched. &quot;I feel
myself the center, the hub, of everything—as far as I can see.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion nodded without interest.
&quot;Now—come with me.&quot; He sped through the air. Shorn followed, exulting
in his new power and freedom. Dominion paused by the corner of the terrace,
glanced over his shoulder. Shorn saw his face in the foreshortened angle:
white, rather pinched features, eyes subtly tilted, brows drawn down, mouth
subtly down-curving. Shorn's elation gave way to sudden wariness. Dominion had
arranged the telekinetic indoctrination with a peculiar facility. The easiest
way to get the desired information, certainly; but was Dominion sufficiently
free from vindictiveness to accept defeat? Shorn considered the expression he
had surprised on Dominion's face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It was a mistake to assume that
any man, Telek or not, would accept with good grace the terms dictated by a
paid turncoat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion would restrain himself
until he learned what Shorn could tell him, then—And then? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn slowed his motion. How could
Dominion arrange a moment of gloating before he finally administered the <i>coup
de grace? </i>Poison seemed most likely. Shorn grinned. Dominion would consider
it beautifully just if Shorn could be killed with his own poison. A sharp blow
or pressure under the jaw would break the capsule in his tooth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Somehow Dominion would manage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They entered a great echoing hall,
suffused with green-yellow light that entered through panes in the high-vaulted
dome. The floor was silver-shot marble; dark-green foliage grew in formal raised
boxes. The air was fresh and odorous with the scent of leaves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion crossed without pause.
Shorn halted halfway across. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion-turned his head.
&quot;Come.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Where?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion's mouth slowly bent into
a grimace that was unmistakably dangerous. &quot;Where we can talk.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We can talk here. I can tell
you what I want to tell you in ten seconds. Or if you like, I'll take you to
the source of the danger.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Very well,&quot; said
Dominion. &quot;Suppose you reveal the nature of the threat against the Teleks.
A brain disease, you said?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. I used the idea as a
figure of speech. The danger I refer to is more cataclysmic than a disease.
Let's go out in the open air. I feel constricted.&quot; He grinned at Dominion.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion drew in a deep breath. It
must infuriate him, thought Shorn, to be commanded and forced to obey a common
man and a traitor to boot. Shorn made a careless gesture. &quot;I intend to
keep my part of the bargain; let's have no misunderstanding there. However —I
want to escape with my winnings, if you understand me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I understand you,&quot; said
Dominion. &quot;I understand you very well.&quot; He made an internal
adjustment, managed to appear almost congenial. &quot;However, perhaps you
misjudge my motives. You are a Telek now; we conduct ourselves by a strict code
of behavior which you must learn.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn put on a face as gracious as
Dominion's. &quot;I suggest, then, that we hold our conference down on
Earth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion pursed his lips.
&quot;You must acclimate yourself to Telek surroundings—think, act, like a
Telek.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;In due time,&quot; said
Shorn. &quot;At the moment I'm rather confused; the sense of power comes as a
great intoxication.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It apparently has not
affected your capacity for caution,&quot; Dominion observed dryly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I suggest that we at least
go out into the open, where we can talk at leisure.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion sighed. &quot;Very
well.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>VI.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie went restlessly to the
dispenser, drew tea for herself, coffee for Circumbright. &quot;I just can't
seem to sit still—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright inspected the pale
face with scientific objectivity. If Laurie condescended to even the slightest
artifice or coquetry, he thought, she would become a creature of tremendous
charm. He watched her appreciatively as she went to the window, looked up into
the sky. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Nothing to see but reflected glow;
nothing to hear but the hum of far traffic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She returned to the couch.
&quot;Have you told Dr. Kurgill —of Cluche?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright stirred his tea.
&quot;Naturally I couldn't tell him the truth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No.&quot; Laurie looked off
into space. She shuddered. &quot;I've never been so nervous before.
Suppose—&quot; Her forebodings could find no words. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You're very fond of Shorn,
aren't you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The quick look, the upward flash
of her eyes, was enough. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They sat in silence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i>&quot;Shh,&quot; </i>said
Laurie. &quot;I think he's coming.&quot; Circumbright heard nothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie rose to her feet. They both
watched the door latch. It moved. The door slid back. The hall was empty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie gasped in something like
terror. There came a tapping at the window. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They wheeled. Shorn was outside,
floating in the air. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>For a moment they stood paralyzed.
Shorn rapped with his knuckles; they saw his mouth form the words, &quot;Let me
in.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie walked stiffly to the
window, swung it open. Shorn jumped down into the room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why did you scare us like
that?&quot; she asked indignantly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm proud of myself. I
wanted to demonstrate my new abilities.&quot; He drew himself a cup of coffee.
&quot;I guess you'll want to know my adventures.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Of course!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He sat down at the table and
described his visit to Glarietta Pavilion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright listened placidly.
&quot;And now what?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And now—you've got a Telek
to experiment on. Unless Dominion conceives a long-distance method of killing
me. He's spending a restless night, I should imagine.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright grunted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;First,&quot; said Shorn,
&quot;they put a bug on me. I expected it. They knew I expected it. I got rid
of it in the Beaux-Arts Museum. Then I began thinking, since they would expect
me to dodge the bug, and feel secure after I'd done so, no doubt they had a way
to locate me again. Tracker material sprayed on my clothes, fluorescent in a
nonvisual frequency. I threw away Cluche's clothes, which I didn't like in the
first place, washed in three changes of solvicine and water, disposed of the
red wig. Cluche Kurgill had disappeared. By the way, where is Cluche's
body?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Safe.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We can let it be found tomorrow
morning. With a sign on him reading, 'I am a Telek spy.' Dominion will
certainly hear of it; he'll think I'm dead, and that will be one problem the
less.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good idea.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But poor old Dr.
Kurgill,&quot; remonstrated Laurie. &quot;He'll never believe such a note.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No ... I suppose not.&quot;
She looked Shorn over from head to feet. &quot;Do you feel different from
before?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I feel as if all of creation
were part of me. Identification with the cosmos, I guess you'd call it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But how does it work?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn deliberated. &quot;I'm
really not sure. I can move the chair the same way I move my arm, with about
the same effort.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Evidently,&quot; said
Circumbright, &quot;Geskamp had told them nothing of the mitrox under the
stadium.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They never asked him. It was
beyond their imagination that we could conceive such an atrocity.&quot; Shorn
laughed. &quot;Dominion was completely flabbergasted. Bowled over. For a few
minutes I think he was grateful to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And then.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And then, I suppose he remembered
his resentment, and began plotting how best to kill me. But I told him nothing
until we were in the open air; any weapon he held I could protect myself from.
A bullet I could think aside, even back at him; a heat-gun I could
deflect.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Suppose his will on the gun
and your will clashed?&quot; Circumbright asked mildly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't know what would
happen. Perhaps nothing. Like a man vacillating between two impulses. Or
perhaps the clash and the subsequent lack of reaction would invalidate both our
confidences, and down we'd fall into the ocean. Because now we were standing on
nothing, a thousand feet over the ocean.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Weren't you afraid,
Will?&quot; asked Laurie. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;At first—yes. But a person
becomes accustomed to the sensation very quickly. It's a thing we've all
experienced in our dreams. Perhaps it's only a trifling aberration that stands
in the way of telekinesis for everyone.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright grunted, loaded his
pipe. &quot;Perhaps we'll find that out, along with the other things.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps. Already I begin to
look at life and existence from another viewpoint.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie looked worried. &quot;I
thought things were just the same.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Fundamentally, yes. But this
feeling of power—of not being tied down—&quot; Shorn laughed. &quot;Don't look
at each other like that. I'm not dangerous. I'm only a Telek by courtesy. And
now, where can we get three pressure suits?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;At this time of night? I
don't know.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No matter. I'm a Telek.
We'll get them. Provided of course you'd like to visit the Moon. All expense
tour, courtesy of Adlari Dominion. Laurie, would you like to fly up, fast as
light, fast as thought, stand in the Earthshine, on the lip of Eratosthenes,
looking out over the Mare Imbrium—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She laughed uneasily. &quot;I'd
love it, Will. But—I'm scared.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What about you,
Gorman?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. You two go. There'll be
other chances for me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie jumped to her feet. Her
cheeks were pink, her mouth was red and half-open in excitement. Shorn looked
at her with a sudden new vision. &quot;Very well, Gorman. Tomorrow you can
start your experiments. Tonight—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie found herself picked up,
carried out through the window. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Tonight,&quot; said Shorn by
her side, &quot;we'll pretend that we're souls—happy souls—exploring the
universe.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright lived in a
near-abandoned suburb to the north of Tran. His house was a roomy old antique,
rearing like a balky horse over the Meyne River. Big industrial plants blocked
the sky in all directions; the air reeked with foundry fumes, sulfur, chlorine,
tar, burnt-earth smells. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Within, the house was cheerful and
untidy. Circumbright's wife was a tall strange woman who worked ten hours a day
in her studio, sculpturing dogs and horses. Shorn had met her only once; so far
as he knew she had no interest or even awareness of Circumbright's anti-Telek
activities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He found Circumbright basking in
the sun watching the brown river water roll past. He sat on a little porch he
had built apparently for no other purpose but this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn dropped a small cloth sack
in his lap. &quot;Souvenirs.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright opened the bag
unhurriedly, pulled out a handful of stones, each tagged with a card label. He
looked at the first, hefted it. &quot;Agate.&quot; He read the label.
&quot;Mars. Well, well.&quot; A bit of black rock was next. &quot;Gabbro? From
. . . let's see. Ganymede. My word, you wandered far afield.&quot; He shot a
bland blue glance up at Shorn. &quot;Telekinesis seems to have agreed with you.
You've lost that haggard hunted expression. Perhaps I'll have to become a Telek
myself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You don't look haggard and
hunted. Quite the reverse.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright returned to the
rocks. &quot;Pumice. From the Moon, I suppose.&quot; He read the label.
&quot;No—Venus. You made quite a trip.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn looked up into the sky.
&quot;Rather hard to describe. There's naturally a feeling of loneliness.
Darkness. Something like a dream. Out on Ganymede we were standing on a ridge,
obsidian, sharp as a razor. Jupiter filled a third of the sky, the red spot
right in the middle, looking at us. There was a pink and blue dimness.
Peculiar. Black rock, the big bright planet. It was—weird. I thought, suppose
the power fails me now, suppose we can't get home? It gave me quite a
chill.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You seem to have made
it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, we made it.&quot; Shorn
seated himself, thrust out his legs. &quot;I'm not hunted and haggard, but I’m
confused. Two days ago I thought I had a good grasp on my convictions—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And now?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now—I don't know.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;About what?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;About—our efforts. Their
ultimate effect, assuming we're successful.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hm-m-m.&quot; Circumbright
rubbed his chin. &quot;Do you still want to submit to experiments?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Of course. I want to know
why and how telekinesis works.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;When will you be
ready?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Whenever you wish.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why not? Let's get started.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;As soon as you're ready,
we'll try encephalographs as a starting point.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright was tired. His face,
normally pink and cherubic, sagged; filling his pipe, his fingers trembled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn leaned back in the leather
chaise longue, regarded Circumbright with mild curiosity. &quot;Why are you so
upset?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright gave the litter of
paper on the workbench a contemptuous flick of the fingers. &quot;It's the
cursed inadequacy of the technique, the instruments. Trying to paint miniatures
with a whisk broom, fix a watch with a pipe wrench. There&quot;—he
pointed—&quot;encephalograms. Every lobe of your brain. Photographs—by x-ray,
by planar section, by metabolism triggering. We've measured your energy flow so
closely that if you tossed me a tennis ball I'd find it on paper
somewhere.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And there's what?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing suggestive. Wavy
lines on the encephalograms. Increased oxygen absorption. Pineal tumescence.
All gross by-products of whatever is happening.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn yawned and stretched.
&quot;About as we expected.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright nodded heavily.
&quot;As we expected. Although I hoped for—something. Some indication where the
energy came from—whether through the brain, from the object itself, or
from—nowhere.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn caused water to leap from a
glass, form a wet glistening hoop in the air. He set it around Circumbright's
neck, started it contracting slowly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hey,&quot; cried
Circumbright reproachfully. &quot;This is serious business.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn snaked the water back in the
glass. Circumbright leaned forward. &quot;Where do <i>you </i>feel the energy
comes from?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn reflected. &quot;It seems to
be in matter itself—just as motion seems to be part of your hand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright sighed in
dissatisfaction. He continued half-querulously. &quot;And at what speed does
telekinesis work? If it's light-speed, then the action presumably occurs in our
own space-time. If it's faster, then it's some other medium, and the whole
thing's unknowable.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn rose to his feet. &quot;We
can check the last with comparative facility.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright shook his head.
&quot;We'd need instruments of a precision I don't have on hand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. Just a stop watch
and—let's see. A flare, a<i> </i>timer, a couple of spacesuits.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What's your idea?&quot;
Circumbright asked suspiciously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm taking you
space-walking.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright rose uncertainly.
&quot;I'm afraid I'll be frightened.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If you're an agoraphobe
don't try it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright blew out his cheeks.
&quot;I'm not that.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You wait here,&quot; said
Shorn. &quot;I'll be back in ten minutes with the spacesuits.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Half an hour later, they stumped
out on Circumbright's little sun porch. Circumbright's outfit had been intended
for a larger man; his head projected only half up into the head-bubble, to
Shorn's amusement. &quot;Ready?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright, his blue eyes wide
and solemn, nodded. &quot;Up we go.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Earth dwindled below, as if
snatched out from under their feet. Speed without acceleration. To all sides
was blackness, the black of vacancy, continuing emptiness. The moon rolled over
their shoulders, a pretty pocked ball, black and silver. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The sun dwindled, became a disk of
glare which seemed to cast no light, no heat. &quot;We're seeing it by its high
frequencies,&quot; Shorn observed. &quot;A kind of reverse Doppler
effect—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Suppose we run into an
asteroid or a<i> </i>meteorite?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Don't worry, we won't.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How do you know? You
couldn't stop in time.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn ruminated. &quot;No. It's
something to think about. I'm not sure whether or not we have momentum. Another
experiment for you to worry about. But after today I'll send some kind of
shield out ahead of us, just in case.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Where are we going?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Out to one of Jupiter's
satellites. Look, there goes Mars.&quot; He dropped the telescopic lens in
front of his eyes. &quot;There's Io. We'll land on Io.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They stood on a dim gray table, a
few feet above a tortured jumble of black scoriae. Frozen white stuff, like
rock salt, lay in the crevices. The horizon was near, very sharp. Jupiter
filled a quadrant of the sky to the left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn arranged the flare and the
timer on a flat area. &quot;I'll set it for ten minutes. Now—on the count of
five I'll start the timer and you start your stop watch.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ready.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;One . . . two . . . three .
. . four ... five.&quot; He looked at Circumbright. Circumbright nodded.
&quot;Good. Now, we take ourselves out into space where we can watch.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Io dwindled to a tarnished metal
disk, a bright spot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We're far enough, I think.
Now we watch for the flare, and check the time by your stop watch. The
increment over ten minutes will give us the light-distance from Io to where
we're—&quot; Shorn considered. &quot;What are we doing? Standing?
Floating?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Waiting.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Waiting. After knowing the
light distance, we can make our tests.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Are we sure that we're not
moving now? If we're moving, our observations will be inaccurate.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shook his head. &quot;We're
not moving. It's the way telekinesis works. I stop us dead, in relation to Io,
the same way a man on roller skates stops by grabbing a post. He just—stops
himself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You know more about it than
I do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's more intuition than
knowledge—which is suggestive in itself. How's the time?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nine minutes. Ten . . .
Twenty seconds. Thirty seconds. Forty. Fifty—one—two—three—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They looked toward lo through the
telescopic visors. Circumbright counted on in the same cadence. &quot;Four—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten
minutes. One—two—three—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A brief flicker appeared from the
dull disk. Circumbright clamped down on the stem of his stop watch. &quot;Three
point six seconds. Allow two tenths of a second reaction time. That gives three
point four seconds. Over six hundred thousand miles. Now what?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Let me have your stop watch.
I'll set it to zero. Now.&quot; Shorn squared himself toward Io. &quot;Now
we'll try telekinesis on a whole world.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright blinked.
&quot;Suppose there's not enough energy available?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We'll soon know.&quot; He
looked at Io, pressed the stop watch starter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>One second—two seconds—three
seconds—Io jerked ahead in its orbit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn looked at the stop watch.
&quot;Three point seven. A tenth of a second, which might be error. Apparently
telekinesis works almost instantaneously.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright looked glumly out
toward incandescent Sirius. &quot;We'll play merry hell trying to get any
significant results with my lab equipment. Somebody's got to invent some new
tools—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn followed his gaze out toward
Sirius. &quot;I wonder what the limit of action is.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright asked doubtfully,
&quot;You're not going to try this ... knack of yours on Sirius?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. We'd have to wait eight
years for the light to reach us. But—&quot; He contemplated the massive form of
Jupiter. &quot;There's a challenging subject right there.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright said uneasily,
&quot;Suppose the effort drains the source of telekinetic energy—like a short
circuit drains a battery? We might be left out here helpless—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shook his head. &quot;It
wouldn't work that way. My mind is the critical factor. Size doesn't mean much,
so long as I can grasp it, take hold of all of it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He stared at Jupiter. Seconds
passed. &quot;About now, if it's going to happen.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Jupiter quivered, floated up
across twenty degrees of sky, dropped back into its former orbit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright looked almost
fearfully at Shorn. Shorn laughed shakily. &quot;Don't worry, Gorman. I'm not
out of my mind. But think of the future! All these wasted worlds moved in
close, bathing in sunlight. Wonderful new planets for men to live on—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They turned their faces toward the
sun. Earth was a mist-white ball, growing larger. &quot;Think,&quot; said
Circumbright, &quot;think of what a mad Telek could do. He could come out here
as we did, pick up the Moon, toss it into North America or Europe as easily as
dropping a rock into the mud. Or he could look at Earth, and it would start to
move toward the sun—through the corona, and Earth would be singed, seared
clean; he could drop it into a sunspot.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn kept his eyes turned away
from Earth. &quot;Don't put ideas into my mind.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's a real problem,&quot;
insisted Circumbright. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I imagine that eventually
there will be an alarm system of some kind; and as soon as it sounds, every
mind will grab on to conditions as they are, and hold tight. Or maybe a corps
of guardians—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>VII.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Back on Earth, in Laurie's
apartment on upper Martinvelt, Shorn and Circumbright sat drinking coffee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright was unaccustomedly
nervous and consulted his watch at five-minute intervals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn watched quizzically.
&quot;Who are you expecting?&quot; Circumbright glanced quickly, guiltily,
round the room. &quot;I suppose there's no spy beetle anywhere close.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not according to the
detector cell.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm waiting for the
messenger. A man called Luby, from East Shore.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't think I know
him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You'd remember him if you
did.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie said, &quot;I think I hear
him now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She went to the door, slid it
back. Luby came into the room, quiet as a cat. He was a man of forty who looked
no more than seventeen. His skin was clear gold, his features chiseled and
handsome, his hair a close cap of tight bronze curls. Shorn thought of the
Renaissance Italians—Cesare Borgia, Lorenzo Medici. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright made introductions
which Luby acknowledged with a nod of the head and a lambent look; then he took
Circumbright aside, muttered in a rapid flow of syllables. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright raised his eyebrows,
asked a question; Luby shook his head, responded impatiently. Circumbright
nodded, and without another word Luby left the room, as quietly as he had
entered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There's a high-level
meeting—policy makers—out at Portinari Gate. We're wanted.&quot; He rose to his
feet, stood indecisively a moment. &quot;I suppose we had better be
going.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn went to the door, looked out
into the corridor. &quot;Luby moves quietly. Isn't it unusual to concentrate
top minds in a single meeting?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Unprecedented. I suppose it's
something important.&quot; Shorn thought a moment. &quot;Perhaps it would be
better to say nothing of my new—achievements.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Very well.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They flew north through the night,
into the foothills, and Lake Paienza spread like a dark blot below, rimmed by
the lights of Portinari. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Portinari Gate was a rambling inn
six hundred years old, high on a hillside, overlooking lake and town. They
dropped to the soft turf in the shadow of great pines, walked to the back
entrance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright knocked, and they
felt a quiet scrutiny. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The door opened, an iron-faced
woman with a halo of iron-gray hair stood facing them. &quot;What do you
want?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright muttered a password;
silently she stepped back. Shorn felt her wary scrutiny as he and Laurie
entered the room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A brown-skinned man with black
eyes and gold rings in his ears flipped up a hand. &quot;Hello,
Circumbright.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hello . . . Thursby, this is
Will Shorn, Laurita Chelmsford.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn inspected the brown man with
interest. The Great Thursby, rumored co-ordinator of the world-wide anti-Telek
underground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There were others in the room,
sitting quietly, watchfully. Circumbright nodded to one or two, then took Shorn
and Laurie to the side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm surprised,&quot; he
said. &quot;The brains of the entire movement are here.&quot; He shook his
head. &quot;Rather ticklish.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn felt of the detector.
&quot;No spy cells.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>More people entered, until
possibly fifty men and women occupied the room. Among the last group was the
young-old Luby. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A stocky dark-skinned man rose to
his feet. &quot;This meeting is a departure from our previous methods, and I
hope it won't be necessary again for a long time.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright whispered to Shorn,
&quot;That's Kasselbarg, European Post.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Kasselbarg swung a slow glance
around the room. &quot;We're starting a new phase of the campaign. Our first
was organizational; we built a world-wide underground, a communication system,
set up a ladder of command. Now—the second stage: preparation for our eventual
action . . . which, of course, will constitute the third stage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We all know the difficulties
under which we work: since we can't hold up a clear and present danger, our government
is not sympathetic to us, and in many cases actively hostile—especially in the
persons of suborned police officials. Furthermore we're under the compulsion of
striking an absolutely decisive blow on our first sally. There won't be a
second chance for us. The Teleks must be&quot;—he paused—&quot;they must be
killed. It's a course toward which we all feel an instinctive revulsion, but
any other course bares us to the incalculable power of the Teleks. Now, any
questions, any comments?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn, compelled by a sudden
pressure he only dimly understood, rose to his feet. &quot;I don't want to turn
the movement into a debating society—but there's another course where killing
is unnecessary. It erases the need of the decisive blow, it gives us a greater
chance of success.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Naturally,&quot; said
Kasselbarg mildly, &quot;I'd like to hear your plan.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No operation, plan it as
carefully as you will, can guarantee the death of every Telek. And those who
aren't killed may go crazy in anger and fear; I can picture a hundred million
deaths, five hundred million, a billion deaths in the first few seconds after
the operation starts—but does not quite succeed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Kasselbarg nodded. &quot;The need
for a hundred per cent <i>coup </i>is emphatic. The formulation of such a plan
will constitute Phase Two, of which I just now spoke. We certainly can't
proceed on any basis other than a ninety-nine per cent probability of
fulfillment.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The iron-faced woman spoke.
&quot;There are four thousand Teleks, more or less. Here on Earth ten thousand
people die every day. Killing the Teleks seems a small price to pay for
security against absolute tyranny. It's either act now, while we have limited
freedom of choice, or dedicate the human race to slavery for as long into the
future as we can imagine.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn looked around the faces in
the room. Laurie was sympathetic; Circumbright looked away uncomfortably;
Thursby frowned thoughtfully; Kasselbarg waited with courteous deference. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Everything you say is
true,&quot; Shorn said. &quot;I would be the most ruthless of us all, if these
four thousand deaths did not rob the human race of the most precious gift it
possesses. Telekinesis to date has been misused; the Teleks have been
remarkable for their selfishness and egotism. But in reacting to the Teleks'
mistakes, we should not make mistakes of our own.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby said in a cool clear
voice, &quot;What is your concrete proposal, Mr. Shorn?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I believe we<i> </i>should
dedicate ourselves, not to killing Teleks, but to giving telekinesis to every
sane man and woman.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A small red-haired man sneered,
&quot;The ancient fallacy, privilege for the chosen ones—in this case, the
sane. And who, pray, determines their sanity?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn smiled. &quot;Your fallacy
is at least an ancient; surely there's nothing occult about sanity. But let me
return to my fundamental proposition—that taking telekinesis out of monopoly
and broadcasting it is a better solution to the problem than killing Teleks.
One way is up, the other down; building versus destruction. In one direction we
put mankind at its highest potential for achievement; in the other we have four
thousand dead Teleks, if our plan succeeds. Always latent is the possibility of
a devastated world.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby said, &quot;You're
convincing, Mr. Shorn. But aren't you operating on the unproved premise that
universal telekinesis is a possibility? Killing the Teleks seems to be easier
than persuading them to share their power; we've got to do one or the
other.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shook his head. &quot;There
are at least two methods to create Teleks. The first is slow and a long-range
job: that is, duplicating the conditions which produced the first Teleks. The
second is much easier, quicker, and, I believe, safer. I have good reason
for—&quot; he stopped short. A faint buzzing, a vibration in his pocket. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The detector. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He turned to Luby, who stood by
the door. &quot;Turn out the lights! There's a Telek spy cell nearby! Out with
the lights, or we're all done for.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Luby hesitated. Shorn cursed under
his breath. Thursby rose to his feet, startled and tense. &quot;What's going
on?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There was a pounding at the door.
&quot;Open up, in the name of the law.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn looked at the windows; the
tough vitripane burst out; the windows were wide open. &quot;Quick, out the
window!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright said in a voice of
deadly passion, &quot;Somewhere there's a traitor—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A man in black and gold appeared
at the window with a heat gun. &quot;Out the door,&quot; he bellowed. &quot;You
can't get away, the place is surrounded. Move out the door in an orderly
fashion; move out the door. You're all under arrest. Don't try to break for it,
our orders are shoot to kill.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright sidled close to
Shorn. &quot;Can't you do something?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not here. Wait till we're
all outside; we don't want anyone shot.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Two burly troopers appeared in the
doorway, gestured with pistols. &quot;Outside, everybody. Keep your hands
up.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby led the way, his face
thoughtful. Shorn followed; behind came the others. They marched into the
parking area, now flooded with light from police lamps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Stop right there,&quot;
barked a new voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby halted. Shorn squinted
against the searchlight; he saw a dozen men standing in a circle around them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;This is a catch and no
mistake,&quot; muttered Thursby. &quot;Quiet! No talking.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Better search them for
weapons,&quot; came another new voice. Shorn recognized the dry phrasing, the
overtones of careless contempt. Adlari Dominion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Two Black and Golds walked through
the group, making a quick search. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A mocking voice came from behind the
searchlights. &quot;Isn't that Colonel Thursby, the people's hero? What's he
doing in this nasty little conspiracy?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby stared ahead with an
immobile face. The red-haired man who had challenged Shorn cried, &quot;You
Telek boot-licker, may the money they pay rot the hands off your wrists!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Easy, Walter,&quot; said
Circumbright. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby spoke toward the lights.
&quot;Are we under arrest?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There was no answer—a contemptuous
silence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby repeated in a sharper
tone. &quot;Are we under arrest? I want to see your warrant; I want to know
what we're charged with.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You're being taken to
headquarters for questioning,&quot; came the reply. &quot;Behave yourselves; if
you've committed no crime, there'll be no charge.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We'll never reach
headquarters,&quot; Circumbright muttered to Shorn. Shorn nodded grimly,
staring into the lights, seeking Dominion. Would he recognize the Cluche
Kurgill whom he had invested with Telek power? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The voice called out, &quot;Were
you contemplating resistance to arrest? Go ahead. Make it easy on us—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There was motion in the group, a
swaying as if from the wind which moved the tops of the dark pine trees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The voice said, &quot;Very well
then, march forward, one at a time. You first, Thursby.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby turned slowly, like a
bull, followed the trooper who walked ahead waving a flashlight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright muttered to Shorn,
&quot;Can't you do something?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not while Dominion is out
there—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Silence!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>One by one, the group followed
Thursby. An air barge loomed ahead, the rear hatch gaping like the mouth of a
cave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Up the ramp; inside.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The hold was a bare, metal-walled
cargo space. The door clanged shut, and the fifty captives stood in sweating
silence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby's voice came from near the
wall. &quot;A clean sweep. Did they get everybody?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright answered in a
carefully toneless voice. &quot;So far as I know.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;This will set the movement
back ten years,&quot; said another voice, controlled but tremulous. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;More likely destroy it
entirely.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But—what can they convict us
of? We're guilty of nothing they can prove.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby snorted. &quot;We'll never
get to Tran. My guess is gas.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Gas?&quot;—a horrified
whisper. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Poison gas pumped through
the ventilator. Then out to sea, drop us, and no one's the wiser. Not even
`killed while escaping.' Nothing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The aircraft vibrated, rose into
the air; under their feet was the soft feeling of air-borne flight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn called out softly.
&quot;Circumbright?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Right here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Make a light.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A paper torch ignited by a
cigarette lighter cast a yellow flicker around the hold; faces glowed pale and
damp as toad-bellies; eyes glared and reflected, in the flare of the torch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The row of ports was well
shuttered, the hand-keys were replaced by bolts. Shorn turned his attention to
the door. He had moved the planet Jupiter; he should be able to break open a
door. But the problem was different; in a sense this bulging open of a door was
a concept several times more advanced than movement of a single object, no
matter how large. There was also a psychological deterrent in the fact that the
door was locked. What would happen if he attempted to telekinecize and nothing
happened? Would he retain his power? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby was standing with his ear
to the ventilator. He turned, nodded. &quot;Here it comes. I can hear the
hiss—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The paper torch was guttering; in
darkness Shorn was as helpless as the others. Desperately he plunged his mind
at the door; the door burst open, out into the night. Shorn caught it before it
fluttered away into the dark air, brought it edgewise back through the door
opening. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The wind had blown out the torch;
Shorn could only vaguely feel the black bulk of the door. He yelled, to be
heard over the roar of the wind rushing past the door, &quot;Stand back, stand
back—&quot; He could wait no longer; he felt reality slipping in the darkness;
the door was only a vague blot. He concentrated on it, strained his eyes to
see, hurled it against the metal hull, stove out a great rent. Air swept
through the hold, whisked out any gas which might have entered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn took himself out the door,
rose above the cabin, looked through the sky dome. A dozen Black and Gold
troopers sat in the forward compartment looking uneasily back toward the cargo
hold whence had come the rending jar. Adlari Dominion was not visible. Luby,
the bronze-haired courier with the medallion face, sat statue-quiet in a
corner. Luby was to be preserved, thought Shorn. Luby was the traitor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He had neither time nor
inclination for half-measures. He tore a strip off the top of the ship; the
troopers and Luby looked up in terror. If they saw him at all, he was a
white-faced demon of the night, riding the wind above them. They were shucked
out of the cabin like peas from a pod, flung out into the night, and their
cries came thinly back to Shorn over the roar of the wind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He jumped down into the cabin, cut
off the motors, jerked the cylinder of gas away from the ventilation system,
then whisked the craft east, toward the Monaghill Mountains. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Clouds fell away from the moon; he
saw a field below. Here was as good a spot as any to land and reorganize. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The aircraft settled to the field.
Dazed, trembling, buffeted, fifty men and women crept from the hold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn found Thursby leaning
against the hull. Thursby looked at him through the moonlight as a child might
watch a unicorn. Shorn grinned. &quot;I know you must be puzzled; I'll tell you
all about it as soon as we're settled. But now—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby squinted. &quot;It's
hardly practical our going home, acting as if nothing had happened. The Black
and Golds took photographs; and there's a number of us that—are not unknown to
them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright appeared out of the
darkness like a pink and brown owl. &quot;There'll be a great deal of
excitement at the Black and Gold headquarters when there's no news of this
hulk.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There'll be a great deal of
irritation at Glarietta Pavilion.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn counted the days on his
fingers. &quot;Today is the twenty-third. Nine days to the first of the
month.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What happens on the first of
the month?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The First Annual Telekinetic
Olympiad, at the new stadium in Swanscomba Valley. In the meantime, there's an
old mine back of Mount Mathias. The bunkhouses should hold two or three
hundred.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But there're only fifty of
us,&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We'll want others. Two
hundred more. Two hundred good people. And to avoid any confusion&quot;—he
looked around to find the red-haired man who thought that sanity was no more
than a function of individual outlook—&quot;we will equate goodness to will to
survival for self, the family group, human culture and tradition.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's broad enough,&quot;
said Thursby equably, &quot;to suit almost anyone. As a practical
standard—&quot; In the moonlight Shorn saw him cock his eyebrows humorously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Practically,&quot; said
Shorn, &quot;we'll pick out people we like.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Sunday morning, June the first,
was dull and overcast. Mist hung along the banks of the Swanscomba River as it
wound in its new looping course down the verdant valley; the trees dripped with
clammy condensations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At eight o'clock a man in rich
garments of purple, black and white dropped from the sky to the rim of the
stadium. He glanced up at the overcast, the cloud-rack broke open like a scum,
slid across the sky. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Horizon to horizon the heavens
showed pure and serene blue; the sun poured warmth into Swanscomba Valley. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The man looked carefully around
the stadium, his black eyes keen, restless. At the far end stood a man in a black
and gold police uniform; he brought the man through the air to the rim of the
stadium beside him. &quot;Good morning, sergeant. Any disturbance?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;None at all, Mr.
Dominion.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How about below?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I couldn't say, sir. I'm
only responsible for the interior, and I've had the lights on all night. Not a
fly has showed itself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good.&quot; Dominion glanced
around the great bowl. &quot;If there are no trespassers now, there won't be
any, since there's no ground-level entrance.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He took himself and the trooper to
the ground. Two other men in uniform appeared. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good morning,&quot; said
Dominion. &quot;Any disturbance?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No sir. Not a sound.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Curious.&quot; Dominion
rubbed his pale peaked chin. &quot;Nothing below the stadium?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing, sir. Not a nail.
We've searched every nook and cranny, down to bedrock, inch by inch.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing on the
detectors?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, sir. If a gopher had
tunneled under the stadium, we'd have known it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion nodded. &quot;Perhaps
there won't be any demonstration after all.&quot; He stroked his chin. &quot;My
intuition is seldom at fault. But never mind. Take all your men, station them
at the upper and lower ends of the valley. Allow no one to enter. No one, on
any pretext whatever. Understand me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion returned to the rim of
the stadium, gazed around the sunny bowl. The grass was green and well-cropped;
the colored upholstery of the chairs made circular bands of pastel around the
stadium. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He took himself through the air to
the director's cupola, an enclosed booth hanging in a vantage point over the
field on a long transparent spar. He entered, seated himself at the table,
switched on the microphone. &quot;One—two—three.&quot; He stopped, listened.
His voice, channeled to speakers in the arms of each of the seats, came back to
him as a husky murmur. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Other Teleks began to arrive,
dropping like brilliant birds from the sky, settling to bask in the sunlight.
Refreshment trays floated past; they sipped fruit juice, tea, and ate
mintcakes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion left the high cupola,
drifted low over the stadium. There was no expectation of filling it; thirty
thousand seats would allow room for future increase. Thirty thousand Teleks was
the theoretical limit that the economy of Earth could maintain at the present
standard of living. And after thirty thousand? Dominion shrugged aside the
question; the problem had no contemporary meaning. The solution should prove
simple enough; there had been talk of swinging Venus out into a cooler orbit,
moving in Neptune, and creating two habitable worlds by transferring half of
Neptune's mantle of ice to dusty Venus. A problem for tomorrow. Today's concern
was the creation of the Telek Earth State, the inculcation of religious awe
into the common folk of Earth—the only means, as it had been decided, to
protect Teleks from witless assassination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He dropped into a group of
friends, seated himself. His work was done for the day; now, with security
achieved, he could relax, enjoy himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Teleks came in greater numbers.
Here was a large group—fifty together. They settled into a section rather high
up on the shady side, somewhat apart from the others. A few minutes later
another group of fifty joined them, and later there were other similar groups. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At nine o'clock the program of
events got under way. A whirlpool of jewel colors glinted high in the sky. A
dozen great ice prisms appeared, each frozen from water of a different color. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They commenced to revolve in a
circle, rotating at the same time; shafts of colored light—red, gold-yellow,
emerald, blue—played around the stadium. Then each of the prisms broke into
twenty sections, and the pieces swung, swirled like a swarm of polychrome
fireflies. With a great swoop, they disappeared into the sky. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The voice of Lemand De Troller,
Program Director, sounded from the speakers: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sixty years ago, at the
original Telekinetic Congress, our race was born. Today is the first annual
convention of the issue of these early giants, and I hope the custom will
persist down the stream of history, down the million years that is our destined
future, ten million times a million years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now—the program for the day.
Immediately following will be a game of bump-ball, for the world championship,
between the Crimean Blues and the Oslandic Vikings. Then there will be a
water-sculpture contest and display, and next—arrow dueling, followed by an
address by Miss Gloriana Hallen, on the Future of Telekinesis, and then lunch
will be served on the turf—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright and Shorn listened
with mounting dissatisfaction. The program director finished. &quot;—the final
valediction by Graycham Gray, our chairman for the year.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright said to Shorn,
&quot;There's nothing there, no mass telekinesis in the entire program.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn said nothing. He leaned back
in his seat, looked up to the director's cupola. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ample opportunity for mass
exercise,&quot; complained Circumbright &quot;and they overlook it
entirely.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn brought his attention back
down from the cupola. &quot;It's an obvious stunt—perhaps too obvious for such
a sophisticated people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright scanned the two
hundred and sixty-five men and women in radiant Telek costumes that Shorn had
brought into the stadium, fifty at a time. &quot;Do you suppose that the
program as it stands will do the trick?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shook his head fretfully.
&quot;Doesn't seem possible. Not enough mass participation.&quot; He looked
over his shoulder to Thursby, in the seat behind him. &quot;Any ideas?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby in brown and yellow said
tentatively, &quot;We can't very well force them to indoctrinate us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Laurie, beside Shorn, laughed
nervously. &quot;Let's send Circumbright out to plead with them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn moved restlessly in his
seat. Two hundred and sixty-five precious lives, dependent for continued
existence on his skill and vigilance. &quot;Maybe something will turn up.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The game of bump-ball was under
way. Five men lying prone in eight-foot red torpedoes competed against five men
in blue torpedoes, each team trying to bump a floating three-foot ball into the
opposition goal. The game was lightning swift, apparently dangerous. The ten
little boats moved so fast as to be mere flickers; the ball slammed back and
forth like a ping-pong ball. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn began to notice curious
glances cast up toward his group. There was no suspicion, only interest;
somehow they were attracting attention. He looked around, and saw his group
sitting straight and tense as vestrymen at a funeral—obviously, uneasy and
uncomfortable. He rose to his feet, spoke in an angry undertone, &quot;Show a
little life; act as if you're enjoying yourselves!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He turned back to the field,
noticed a service wagon not in use, pulled it up, moved it past his charges.
Gingerly they took tea, rum punch, cakes, fruit. Shorn set the case back on the
turf. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The bump-bail game ended; now
began the water sculpture. Columns of water reared into the air: thousands of
gallons, working into glistening soft forms. Quivering pliant water caught the
sunlight, glowed deep from within the nonobjectives, the human figures, the
heads, the interlocking geometric patterns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Event followed event: competitions
and displays in color, skill, ingenuity, swift reaction; arrows were pitted
against arrows each trying to pierce the bladder trailed by the other. Colored
spheres were raced through an obstacle course; there was an exhibition in which
sparrows were released and after an interval herded into a basket by a small
white tambourine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The air over the stadium swam with
fascinating colors, shapes, tapes, screens, and so passed the morning. At
twelve laden buffet tables dropped from sky to the stadium turf. And now Shorn
found himself on the horns of a dilemma. By remaining aloof from the tables his
group made themselves conspicuous; but they risked quick detection by mingling
with the Teleks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby resolved the problem. He
leaned forward. &quot;Don't you think we'd better go down to lunch? Maybe a few
at a time. We stick out like a sore thumb sitting up here hungry.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn nodded acquiescently. By
ones and twos he sent the members of his company down to the sward. Laurie
nudged him. &quot;Look. There's Dominion. He's talking to old Poole.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright in unusual agitation
said: &quot;I hope Poole keeps his wits about him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn smiled grimly. &quot;If
Dominion makes one move—&quot; Circumbright saw one of the dueling arrows lift
easily into the air. Dominion turned away. Shorn sighed. The arrow returned to
the turf. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A moment later he brought Poole
back to his seat. &quot;What did Dominion want?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Poole was a scholarly-looking man
of middle age, mild and myopic. &quot;Dominion? Oh, the gentleman who spoke to
me. He was very pleasant. Asked if I were enjoying the spectacles, and said
that he didn't think he recognized me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And what did you say?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I said I didn't get out very
much, and that there were many here I hardly knew.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And then?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;He just moved away.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn sighed. &quot;Dominion is
very sharp.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thursby wore a worried frown. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Things haven't gone so well
this morning.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. But there's still the
afternoon.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The afternoon program began with a
score of young Telek girls performing an air ballet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>IX.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Three o'clock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There's not much more,&quot;
said Circumbright. Shorn sat hunched forward. &quot;No.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Circumbright clenched the arms of
his seat. &quot;We've got to do something—and I know what to do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Drop me down to the field.
I'll pick up the arrows, and you start picking off Teleks. Dominion first. Then
they'll all—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn shook his head. &quot;It
wouldn't work. You'd be throwing away your life for nothing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why wouldn't it work?&quot;
Circumbright demanded belligerently. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn gestured to the two hundred
and sixty-five. &quot;Do you think we could arouse a real rapport in the
business of pulverizing you? No.&quot; He looked up to the director's cupola.
&quot;It's got to come from there. And I've got to arrange it.&quot; He reached
over, clasped Laurie's hand, nodded to Thursby, rose to his feet, took himself
by an inconspicuous route along the back wall, up to the transparent spar
supporting the cupola. Inside he glimpsed the shapes of two men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He slid back the door, entered
quietly, froze in his footprints. Adlari Dominion, lounging back in an elastic
chair, smiled up at him, ominous as a cobra. &quot;Come in. I've been expecting
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn looked quickly to Lemand De
Troller, the program director, a bulky blond man with lines of self-indulgence
clamping his mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How so?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I have a pretty fair idea of
your intentions, and I admit their ingenuity. Unluckily for you, I inspected
the body of Cluche Kurgill, assassinated a short time ago, and it occurred to
me that this was not the man whom I entertained at Glarietta; I have since
reprimanded myself for not scrutinizing the catch at Portinari Gate more
carefully. In any event, today will be a complete debacle, from your
standpoint. I have excised from the program any sort of business which might
have helped you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn said thickly, &quot;You
showed a great deal of forbearance in allowing us to enjoy your program.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion made a lazy gesture.
&quot;It is as well not to bring our problems too sharply to the attention of
the spectators; it might lay a macabre overtone upon the festival, for them to
observe at close hand two hundred and sixty-five condemned anarchists and
provocateurs.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You should have been made
very uncomfortable if I had not come up here to the cupola.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion shook his head
indulgently. &quot;I asked myself, what would I do in your position? I
answered, I would proceed to the cupola and myself direct such an event to suit
my purposes. So—I preceded you.&quot; He smiled. &quot;And now—the sorry
rebellion is at its end. The entire nucleus of your gang is within reach,
helpless; if you recall, there is no exit, they have no means to scale the
walls.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn felt thick bile rising in
his throat; his voice sounded strange to his ears. &quot;It's not necessary to
revenge yourself on all these people; they're merely decent individuals, trying
to cope with—&quot; He spoke on, pleading half-angrily for the two hundred and
sixty-five. Meanwhile his mind worked at a survival sub-level. Dominion, no matter
how lazy-seeming and catlike, was keyed up, on his guard; there would be no
surprising him. In any struggle Lemand De Troller, the program director, would
supply the decisive force. Shorn might be able to parry the weapons of one man,
but two cores of thought would be too much for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Decision and action came to him
simultaneously. He gave the cupola a great shake; startled, De Troller seized
the desk. Shorn threw a coffee mug at his head. Instantly, before the mug had
even struck, he flung himself to the floor. Dominion, seizing the instant of
Shorn's distraction, had aimed a gun at him, fired an explosive pellet. Shorn
hit the floor, saw De Troller slump, snatched the weapon from Dominion's hand,
all at once. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The gun clattered to the deck, and
Shorn found himself looking into Dominion's pale glowing eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion spoke in a low voice.
&quot;You're very quick. You've effectively reduced the odds against
yourself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn smiled tightly. &quot;What
odds do you give me now?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Roughly, a thousand to one.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Seems to me they're even.
You against me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. I can hold you helpless,
at the very least, until the program property man returns.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn slowly rose to his feet.
Careful. Let no movement escape his eye. Without moving his eyes from Dominion's,
he lifted the coffee mug, hurled it at Dominion's head. Dominion diverted it,
accelerated it, toward Shorn. Shorn bounced it back, into Dominion's face. It
stopped only an inch short, then sprang back at Shorn's head with tremendous
speed. Shorn flicked it with a thought, he felt the breath of its passage and
it shattered against the wall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You're fast,&quot; said
Dominion lightly. &quot;Very fast indeed. In theory, your reactions should have
missed that.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn stared at him thoughtfully.
&quot;I've got a theory of my own.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'd like to hear it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What happens when two minds
try to teleport an object in opposing directions?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion frowned slightly. &quot;A
very exhausting matter, if carried to the limit. The mind with the greater
certainty wins, the other mind—sometimes—lapses.&quot; Shorn stared at
Dominion. &quot;My mind is stronger than yours.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion's eyes lit up with a
peculiar inner glow, then filmed over. &quot;Very well, suppose it is? What do
I gain in proving otherwise?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn said, &quot;If you want to
save your life—you'll have to.&quot; With his eyes still on Dominion, he took a
knife from his pocket, flicked open the blade. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It leaped from his hand at his
eyes. He frantically diverted it, and in the instant his defense was
distracted, the gun darted to Dominion's hand. Shorn twisted up the muzzle by a
hair's-breath; the pellet sang past his ear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Fragments of the coffee mug pelted
the back of his head, blinding him with pain. Dominion, smiling and easy,
raised the gun. It was all over, Shorn thought. His mind, wilted and spent,
stood naked and bare of defense—for the flash of an instant. Before Dominion
could pull the trigger, Shorn flung the knife at his throat. Dominion turned
his attention away from the gun to divert the knife; Shorn reached out, grabbed
the gun with his bare hands, tossed it under the table out of sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion and Shorn glared eye to
eye. Both of them thought of the knife. It lay on the table, and now under the
impulse of both minds, slowly trembled, rose quivering into the air, hilt up,
blade down, swinging as if hung by a short string. Gradually it drifted to a
position midway between their eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The issue was joined. Sweating,
breathing hard, they glared at the knife, and it vibrated, sang to the induced
quiver from the opposing efforts. Eye to eye stared Dominion and Shorn, faces
red, mouths open, distorted. No opportunity now for diversionary tactics; relax
an instant and the knife would stab; blunt force strained against force. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion said slowly, &quot;You
can't win, you who have only known telekinesis a few days; your certainty is as
nothing compared to mine. I've lived my lifetime in certainty; it's part of my
living will, and now see—your reality is weakening, the knife is aiming at you,
to slash your neck.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn watched the knife in
fascination, and indeed it slowly turned toward him like the clock-hand of
Fate. Sweat streamed into his eyes; he was aware of Dominion's grimace of
triumph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>No. Allow no words to distract
you; permit no suggestion; bend down Dominion's own resolution. His vocal
chords were like rusty wire, his voice was a croak. &quot;My certainty is
stronger than yours, because&quot;—as he said the words the knife halted its
sinister motion toward his throat—&quot;time has no effect upon telekinesis!
Because I've got the will of all humanity behind me, and you've got only
yourself!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The knife trembled, twisted, as if
it were a live thing, tortured by indecision. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm stronger than you are,
because—I've <i>got to be!&quot; </i>He sank the words into Dominion's mind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dominion said quickly, &quot;Your
neck hurts, your mind hurts, you cannot see.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn's neck hurt indeed, his head
ached, sweat stung his eyes, and the knife made a sudden lurch toward him. This
can't go on, thought Shorn. &quot;I don't need tricks, Dominion; you need them
only because your confidence is going and you're desperate.&quot; He took a
deep breath, reached out, seized the knife, plunged it into Dominion's breast. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn stood looking down at the
body. &quot;I won—and by a trick. He was so obsessed by the need for defeating
me mentally that he forgot the knife had a handle.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Panting he looked out over the
stadium. Events had come to a halt. The spectators restively waited for word
from the program director. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn picked up the microphone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Men and women of the
future—&quot; as he spoke he watched the little huddle of two hundred and
sixty-five. He saw Laurie stir, look up; he saw Circumbright turn, clap
Thursby's knee. He felt the wave of thankfulness, of hero-worship, almost
insane in its fervor that welled up from their minds. At that moment he could
have commanded any of them to their death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>An intoxicated elation came to
him; he fought to control his voice. &quot;This is an event improvised to thank
Lemand De Troller, our program director, for his work in arranging the events.
All of us will join our telekinetic powers together; we will act as one mind. I
will guide this little white ball&quot;—he lifted a small ball used in the
obstacle race—&quot;through the words 'Thank you, Lemand De Troller.' You, with
your united wills, will follow with the large bump-ball.&quot; He rolled it out
into the center of the stadium. &quot;With more preparation we would have
achieved something more elaborate, but I know Lemand will be just as pleased if
he feels all of us are concentrating on the big ball, putting our hearts into
the thanks. So—now. Follow the little white ball.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Slowly he guided the white ball
along imaginary block letters in the air; faithfully the big bump-ball
followed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It was finished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn looked anxiously toward
Circumbright. No signal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Once again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now—there is one other to
whom we owe a vote of thanks: Adlari Dominion, the capable liaison officer.
This time we will spell out, 'Thank you and good luck, Adlari Dominion.' &quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The white ball moved. The big ball
followed. Four thousand minds impelled, two hundred and sixty-five minds sought
to merge into the pattern: each a new prometheus trying to steal a secret more
precious than fire from a race more potent than the Titans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn finished the last N, glanced
toward Circumbright. Still no signal. Anxiety beset him; was this the right
indoctrination technique? Suppose it was only effective under special
conditions, suppose he had been operating on a misapprehension the entire time?
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well,&quot; said Shorn
doggedly, &quot;once again.&quot; But the spectators would be growing restless.
Who to thank this time? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The ball was moving of its own
volition. Shorn, fascinated, followed its path. It was spelling a word. W-I-L-L—then
a space—S-H-O-R-N—another space—T-H-A-N-K-S. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn sank back into the elastic
seat, his eyes brimming with tears of release and thankfulness. &quot;Someone
is thanking Will Shorn,&quot; he said into the microphone. &quot;It's time for
them to leave.&quot; He paused. Two hundred and sixty-five new telekinetics
lifted themselves from the stadium, flew west toward Tran, disappeared into the
afternoon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shorn returned to the microphone.
&quot;There're a few more words I want to say; please be patient a moment or two
longer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You have just been
witnesses—unwitting witnesses —to an event as important as Joffrey's original
congress. The future will consider the sixty-year interval only a transition,
humanity's final separation from the beast. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We have completely subdued
the material world; we know the laws governing all the phenomena that our
senses can detect. Now we turn ourselves Ito a new direction; humanity enters a
new stage, and wonderful things lie before us.&quot; He noticed a ripple of
uneasiness running along the ranks of the Teleks. &quot;This new world is on
us, we can't evade it. For sixty years the Teleks have rejoiced in a state of
special privilege, and this is the last shackle humanity throws off: the idea
that one man may dominate or control another man.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He paused; the uneasiness was ever
more marked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There are trying times to
come—a period of severe readjustment. At the moment you are not quite certain
to what I am referring, and that is just as well. Thank you for your attention
and good-by. I hope you enjoyed the program as much as I did.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He rose to his feet, stepped over
Dominion's body, slid back the door, stepped out of the cupola. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Teleks leaving the stadium rose up
past him like mayflies, some turning him curious glances as they flew. Shorn,
smiling, watched them flit past, toward their glittering pavilions, their
cloud-castles, their sea-bubbles. The last one was gone; he waved an arm after
them as if in valediction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Then he himself rose, plunged
westward toward the sword-shaped towers of Tran, where two hundred and
sixty-five men and women were already starting to spread telekinesis through
all of mankind. </p>
