<P>The war party from Faide Keep moved eastward
across the downs: a column of a hundred armored knights, five hundred
foot soldiers, a train of wagons. In the lead rode Lord Faide, a tall
man in his early maturity, spare and catlike, with a sallow dyspeptic
face. He sat in the ancestral car of the Faides, a boat-shaped
vehicle floating two feet above the moss, and carried, in addition to
his sword and dagger, his ancestral side weapons.</P>
<P>An hour before sunset a pair of scouts came racing
back to the column, their club-headed horses loping like dogs. Lord
Faide braked the motion of his car. Behind him the Faide kinsmen, the
lesser knights, and the leather-capped foot soldiers halted; to the
rear the baggage train and the high-wheeled wagons of the jinxmen
creaked to a stop.</P>
<P>The scouts approached at breakneck speed, at the
last instant flinging their horses sidewise. Long shaggy legs kicked
out, padlike hooves plowed through the moss. The scouts jumped to the
ground, ran forward. &quot;The way to Ballant Keep is blocked!&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide rose in his seat, stood staring
eastward over the gray-green downs. &quot;How many knights? How many
men?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No knights, no men, Lord Faide. The First
Folk have planted a forest between North and South Wildwood.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide stood a moment in reflection, then
seated himself and pushed the control knob. The car wheezed, jerked,
moved forward. The knights touched up their horses; the foot soldiers
resumed their slouching gait. At the rear the baggage train creaked
into motion, together with the six wagons of the jinxmen.</P>
<P>The sun, large, pale, and faintly pink, sank in
the west. North Wildwood loomed down from the left, separated from
South Wildwood by an area of stony ground, only sparsely patched with
moss. As the sun passed behind the horizon, the new planting became
visible: a frail new growth connecting the tracts of woodland like a
canal between two seas.</P>
<P>Lord Faide halted his car, stepped down to the
moss. He appraised the landscape, then gave the signal to make camp.
The wagons were ranged in a circle, the gear unloaded. Lord Faide
watched the activity for a moment, eyes sharp and critical, then
turned and walked out across the downs through the lavender and green
twilight. Fifteen miles to the east his last enemy awaited him: Lord
Ballant of Ballant Keep. Contemplating the next day's battle, Lord
Faide felt reasonably confident of the outcome. His troops had been
tempered by a dozen campaigns; his kinsmen were loyal and
singlehearted. Head Jinxman to Faide Keep was Hein Huss, and
associated with him were three of the most powerful jinxmen of
Pangborn: Isak Comandore, Adam McAdam, and the remarkable Enterlin,
together with their separate troupes of cabalmen, spellbinders, and
apprentices. Altogether, an impressive assemblage. Certainly there
were obstacles to be overcome: Ballant Keep was strong; Lord Ballant
would fight obstinately; Anderson Grimes, the Ballant Head Jinxman,
was efficient and highly respected. There was also this nuisance of
the First Folk and the new planting which closed the gap between
North and South Wildwood. The First Folk were a pale and feeble race,
no match for human beings in single combat, but they guarded their
forests with traps and deadfalls. Lord Faide cursed softly under his
breath. To circle either North or South Wildwood meant a delay of
three days, which could not be tolerated.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Lord Faide returned to the camp. Fires were
alight, pots bubbled, orderly rows of sleep holes had been dug into
the moss. The knights groomed their horses within the corral of
wagons; Lord Faide's own tent had been erected on a hummock, beside
the ancient car.</P>
<P>Lord Faide made a quick round of inspection,
noting every detail, speaking no word. The jinxmen were encamped a
little distance apart from the troops. The apprentices and lesser
spellbinders prepared food, while the jinxmen and cabal-men worked
inside their tents, arranging cabinets and cases, correcting whatever
disorder had been caused by the jolting of the wagons.</P>
<P>Lord Faide entered the tent of his Head Jinxman.
Hein Huss was an enormous man, with arms and legs heavy as tree
trunks, a torso like a barrel. His face was pink and placid, his eyes
were water-clear; a stiff gray brush rose from his head, which was
innocent of the cap jinxmen customarily wore against the loss of
hair. Hein Huss disdained such precautions; it was his habit, showing
his teeth in a face-splitting grin, to rumble, &quot;Why should any
hoodoo me, old Hein Huss? I am so inoffensive. Whoever tried would
surely die of shame and remorse.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide found Huss busy at his cabinet. The
doors stood wide, revealing hundreds of manikins, each tied with a
lock of hair, a bit of cloth, a fingernail clipping, daubed with
grease, sputum, excrement, blood. Lord Faide knew well that one of
these manikins represented himself. He also knew that should he
request it Hein Huss would deliver it without hesitation. Part of
Huss's <I>mana </I>derived from his enormous confidence, the
effortless ease of his power. He glanced at Lord Faide and read the
question in his mind. &quot;Lord Ballant did not know of the new
planting. Anderson Grimes has now informed him, and Lord Ballant
expects that you will be delayed. Grimes has communicated with
Gisborne Keep and Castle Cloud. Three hundred men march tonight to
reinforce Ballant Keep. They will arrive in two days. Lord Ballant is
much elated.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide paced back and forth across the tent.
&quot;Can we cross this planting?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss made a heavy sound of disapproval.
&quot;There are many futures. In certain of these futures you pass.
In others you do not pass. I cannot ordain these futures.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide had long learned to control his
impatience at what sometimes seemed to be pedantic obfuscation. He
grumbled, &quot;They are either very stupid or very bold planting
across the downs in this fashion. I cannot imagine what they intend.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss considered, then grudgingly volunteered
an idea. &quot;What if they plant west from North Wildwood to Sarrow
Copse? What if they plant west from South Wildwood to Old Forest?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then Faide Keep is almost ringed by forest.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what if they join Sarrow Copse to Old
Forest?&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide stood stock-still, his eyes narrow and
thoughtful. &quot;Faide Keep would be surrounded by forest. We would
be imprisoned. . . . These plantings, do they proceed?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They proceed, so I have been told.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do they hope to gain?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not know. Perhaps they hope to isolate
the keeps, to rid the planet of men. Perhaps they merely want secure
avenues between the forests.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide considered. Huss's final suggestion was
reasonable enough. During the first centuries of human settlement,
sportive young men had hunted the First Folk with clubs and lances,
eventually had driven them from their native downs into the forests.
&quot;Evidently they are more clever than we realize. Adam McAdam
asserts that they do not think, but it seems that he is mistaken.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss shrugged. &quot;Adam McAdam equates
thought to the human cerebral process. He cannot telepathize with the
First Folk, hence he deduces that they do not 'think.' But I have
watched them at Forest Market, and they trade intelligently enough.&quot;
He raised his head, appeared to listen, then reached into his cabinet
and delicately tightened a noose around the neck of one of the
manikins. From outside the tent came a sudden cough and a whooping
gasp for air. Huss grinned, twitched open the noose. &quot;That is
Isak Comandore's apprentice. He hopes to complete a Hein Huss
manikin. I must say he works diligently, going so far as to touch its
feet into my footprints whenever possible.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide went to the flap of the tent. &quot;We
break camp early. Be alert, I may require your help.&quot; He
departed the tent.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Hein Huss continued the ordering of his cabinet.
Presently he sensed the approach of his rival, Jinxman Isak
Comandore, who coveted the office of Head Jinxman with all-consuming
passion. Huss closed the cabinet and hoisted himself to his feet.</P>
<P>Comandore entered the tent, a man tall, crooked,
and spindly. His wedge-shaped head was covered with coarse russet
ringlets; hot red-brown eyes peered from under his red eyebrows. &quot;I
offer my complete rights to Keyril, and will include the masks, the
headdress, the amulets. Of all the demons ever contrived he has won
the widest public acceptance. To utter the name Keyril is to complete
half the work of a possession. Keyril is a valuable property. I can
give no more.&quot;</P>
<P>But Huss shook his head. Comandore's desire was
the full simulacrum of Tharon Faide, Lord Faide's oldest son,
complete with clothes, hair, skin, eyelashes, tears, excrement, sweat
and sputum&mdash;the only one in existence, for Lord Faide guarded
his son much more jealously than he did himself. &quot;You offer
convincingly,&quot; said Huss, &quot;but my own demons suffice. The
name Dant conveys fully as much terror as Keyril.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will add five hairs from the head of
Jinxman Clarence Sears; they are the last, for he is now stark bald.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us drop the matter; I will keep the
simulacrum.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As you please,&quot; said Comandore with
asperity. He glanced out the flap of the tent. &quot;That blundering
apprentice. He puts the feet of the manikin backwards into your
prints.&quot;</P>
<P>Huss opened his cabinet, thumped a manikin with
his finger. From outside the tent came a grunt of surprise. Huss
grinned. &quot;He is young and earnest, and perhaps he is clever, who
knows?&quot; He went to the flap of the tent, called outside. &quot;Hey,
Sam Salazar, what do you do? Come inside.&quot;</P>
<P>Apprentice Sam Salazar came blinking into the
tent, a thickset youth with a round florid face, overhung with a
rather untidy mass of straw-colored hair. In one hand he carried a
crude pot-bellied manikin, evidently intended to represent Hein Huss.</P>
<P>&quot;You puzzle both your master and myself,&quot;
said Huss. &quot;There must be method in your folly, but we fail to
perceive it. For instance, this moment you place my simulacrum
backwards into my track. I feel a tug on my foot, and you pay for
your clumsiness.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar showed small evidence of abashment.
&quot;Jinxman Comandore has warned that we must expect to suffer for
our ambitions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If your ambition is jinxmanship,&quot;
Comandore declared sharply, &quot;you had best mend your ways.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The lad is craftier than you know,&quot;
said Hein Huss. &quot;Look now.&quot; He took the manikin from the
youth, spit into its mouth, plucked a hair front his head, thrust it
into a convenient crevice. &quot;He has a Hein Huss manikin, achieved
at very small cost. Now, Apprentice Salazar, how will you hoodoo me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Naturally, I would never dare. I merely want
to fill the bare spaces in my cabinet.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss nodded his approval. &quot;As good a
reason as any. Of course you own a simulacrum of Isak Comandore?&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar glanced uneasily at Isak Comandore.
&quot;He leaves none of his traces. If there is so much as an open
bottle in the room, he breathes behind his hand.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ridiculous!&quot; exclaimed Hein Huss.
&quot;Comandore, what do you fear?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am conservative,&quot; said Comandore,
dryly. &quot;You make a fine gesture, but some day an enemy may own
that simulacrum; then you will regret your bravado.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bah. My enemies are all dead, save one or
two who dare not reveal themselves.&quot; He clapped Sam Salazar a
great buffet on the shoulder. &quot;Tomorrow, Apprentice Salazar,
great things are in store for you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What manner of great things?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Honor, noble self-sacrifice. Lord Faide must
beg permission from the First Folk to pass Wildwood, which galls him.
But beg he must. Tomorrow, Sam Salazar, I will elect you to lead the
way to the parley, to deflect deadfalls, scythes, and nettletraps
from the more important person who follows.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar shook his head and drew back. &quot;There
must be others more worthy; I prefer to ride in the rear with the
wagons.&quot;</P>
<P>Comandore waved him from the tent. &quot;You will
do as ordered. Leave us; we have had enough apprentice talk.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar departed. Comandore turned back to
Hein Huss. &quot;In connection with tomorrow's battle, Anderson
Grimes is especially adept with demons. As I recall, he has developed
and successfully publicized Pont, who spreads sleep; Everid, a being
of wrath; Deigne, a force of fear. We must take care that in
countering these effects we do not neutralize each other.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;True,&quot; rumbled Huss. &quot;I have long
maintained to Lord Faide that a single jinxman&mdash;the Head Jinxman
in fact&mdash;is more effective than a group at cross-purposes. But
he is consumed by ambition and does not listen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps he wants to be sure that should
advancing years overtake the Head Jinxman other equally effective
jinxmen are at hand.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The future has many paths,&quot; agreed Hein
Huss. &quot;Lord Faide is well advised to seek early for my
successor, so that I may train him over the years. I plan to access
all the subsidiary jinxmen, and select the most promising. Tomorrow I
relegate to you the demons of Anderson Grimes.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore nodded politely. &quot;You are wise
to give over responsibility. When I feel the weight of my years I
hope I may act with similar forethought. Good night, Hein Huss. I go
to arrange my demon masks. Tomorrow Keyril must walk like a giant.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good night, Isak Comandore.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Comandore swept from the tent, and Huss settled
himself on his stool. Sam Salazar scratched at the flap. &quot;Well,
lad?&quot; growled Huss. &quot;Why do you loiter?&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar placed the Hein Huss manikin on the
table. &quot;I have no wish to keep this doll.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Throw it in a ditch, then.&quot; Hein Huss
spoke gruffly. &quot;You must stop annoying me with stupid tricks.
You efficiently obtrude yourself upon my attention, but you cannot
transfer from Comandore's troupe without his express consent.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If I gain his consent?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will incur his enmity; he will open his
cabinet against you. Unlike myself, you are vulnerable to a hoodoo. I
advise you to be content. Isak Comandore is highly skilled and can
teach you much.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar still hesitated. &quot;Jinxman
Comandore, though skilled, is intolerant of new thoughts.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss shifted ponderously on his stool,
examined Sam Salazar with his water-clear eyes. &quot;What new
thoughts are these? Your own?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The thoughts are new to me, and for all I
know new to Isak Comandore. But he will say neither yes nor no.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss sighed, settled his monumental bulk more
comfortably. &quot;Speak then, describe these thoughts, and I will
assess their novelty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;First, I have wondered about trees. They are
sensitive to light, to moisture, to wind, to pressure. Sensitivity
implies sensation. Might a man feel into the soul of a tree for these
sensations? If a tree were capable of awareness, this faculty might
prove useful. A man might select trees as sentinels in strategic
sites, and enter into them as he chose.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss was skeptical. &quot;An amusing notion,
but practically not feasible. The reading of minds, the act of
possession, televoyance, all similar interplay, require psychic
congruence as a basic condition. The minds must be able to become
identities at some particular stratum. Unless there is sympathy,
there is no linkage. A tree is at opposite poles from a man; the
images of tree and man are incommensurable. Hence, anything more than
the most trifling flicker of comprehension must be a true miracle of
jinxmanship.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar nodded mournfully. &quot;I realized
this, and at one time hoped to equip myself with the necessary
identification.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To do this you must become a vegetable.
Certainly the tree will never become a man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So I reasoned,&quot; said Sam Salazar. &quot;I
went alone into a grove of trees, where I chose a tall conifer. I
buried my feet in the mold, I stood silent and naked&mdash;in the
sunlight, in the rain; at dawn, noon, dusk, midnight. I closed my
mind to manthoughts, I closed my eyes to vision, my ears to sound. I
took no nourishment except from rain and sun. I sent roots forth from
my feet and branches from my torso. Thirty hours I stood, and two
days later another thirty hours, and after two days another thirty
hours. I made myself a tree, as nearly as possible to one of flesh
and blood.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss gave the great inward gurgle that
signalized his amusement. &quot;And you achieved sympathy?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing useful,&quot; Sam Salazar admitted.
&quot;I felt something of the tree's sensations&mdash;the activity of
light, the peace of dark, the coolness of rain. But visual and
auditory experience &mdash;nothing. However, I do not regret the
trial. It was a useful discipline.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An interesting effort, even if inconclusive.
The idea is by no means of startling originality, but the
empiricism&mdash;to use an archaic word&mdash;of your method is bold,
and no doubt antagonized Isak Comandore, who has no patience with the
superstitions of our ancestors. I suspect that he harangued you
against frivolity, metaphysics, and inspirationalism.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;True,&quot; said Sam Salazar. &quot;He spoke
at length.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You should take the lesson to heart. Isak
Comandore is sometimes unable to make the most obvious truth seem
credible. However, I cite you the example of Lord Faide who considers
himself an enlightened man, free from superstition. Still, he rides
in his feeble car, he carries a pistol sixteen hundred years old, he
relies on Hellmouth to protect Faide Keep.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps&mdash;unconsciously&mdash;he longs
for the old magical times,&quot; suggested Sam Salazar thoughtfully.</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; agreed Hein Huss. &quot;And
you do likewise?&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar hesitated. &quot;There is an aura of
romance, a kind of wild grandeur to the old days&mdash;but of
course,&quot; he added quickly, &quot;mysticism is no substitute for
orthodox logic.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Naturally not,&quot; agreed Hein Huss. &quot;Now
go; I must consider the events of tomorrow.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar departed, and Hein Huss, rumbling and
groaning, hoisted himself to his feet. He went to the flap of his
tent, surveyed the camp. All now was quiet. The fires were embers,
the warriors lay in the pits they had cut into the moss. To the north
and south spread the woodlands. Among the trees and out on the downs
were faint flickering luminosities, where the First Folk gathered
spore-pods from the moss.</P>
<P>Hein Huss became aware of a nearby personality. He
turned his head and saw approaching the shrouded form of Jinxman
Enterlin, who concealed his face, who spoke only in whispers, who
disguised his natural gait with a stiff stiltlike motion. By this
means he hoped to reduce his vulnerability to hostile jinxmanship.
The admission carelessly let fall of failing eyesight, of stiff
joints, forgetfulness, melancholy, nausea might be of critical
significance in controversy by hoodoo. Jinxmen therefore maintained
the pose of absolute health and virility, even though they must grope
blindly or limp doubled up from cramps.</P>
<P>Hein Huss called out to Enterlin, lifted back the
flap to the tent. Enterlin entered; Huss went to the cabinet, brought
forth a flask, poured liquor into a pair of stone cups. &quot;A
cordial only, free of overt significance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good,&quot; whispered Enterlin, selecting
the cup farthest from him. &quot;After all, we jinxmen must relax
into the guise of men from time to time.&quot; Turning his back on
Huss, he introduced the cup through the folds of his hood, drank.
&quot;Refreshing,&quot; he whispered. &quot;We need refreshment;
tomorrow we must work.&quot;</P>
<P>Huss issued his reverberating chuckle. &quot;Tomorrow
Isak Comandore matches demons with Anderson Grimes. We others perform
only subsidiary duties.&quot;</P>
<P>Enterlin seemed to make a quizzical inspection of
Hein Huss through the black gauze before his eyes. &quot;Comandore
will relish this opportunity. His vehemence oppresses me, and his is
a power which feeds on success. He is a man of fire, you are a man of
ice.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ice quenches fire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fire sometimes melts ice.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss shrugged. &quot;No matter. I grow weary.
Time has passed all of us by. Only a moment ago a young apprentice
showed me to myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As a powerful jinxman, as Head Jinxman to
the Faides, you have cause for pride.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss drained the stone cup, set it aside.
&quot;No. I see myself at the top of my profession, with nowhere else
to go. Only Sam Salazar the apprentice thinks to search for more
universal lore; he comes to me for counsel, and I do not know what to
tell him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Strange talk, strange talk!&quot; whispered
Enterlin. He moved to the flap of the tent. &quot;I go now,&quot; he
whispered. &quot;I go to walk on the downs. Perhaps I will see the
future.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There are many futures.&quot;</P>
<P>Enterlin rustled away and was lost in the dark.
Hein Huss groaned and grumbled, then took himself to his couch, where
he instantly fell asleep.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>II</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The night passed. The sun, flickering with films
of pink and green, lifted over the horizon. The new planting of the
First Folk was silhouetted, a sparse stubble of saplings, against the
green and lavender sky. The troops broke camp with practiced
efficiency. Lord Faide marched to his car, leaped within; the machine
sagged under his weight. He pushed a button, the car drifted forward,
heavy as a waterlogged timber.</P>
<P>A mile from the new planting he halted, sent a
messenger back to the wagons of the jinxmen. Hein Huss walked
ponderously forward, followed by Isak Comandore, Adam McAdam, and
Enterlin. Lord Faide spoke to Hein Huss. &quot;Send someone to speak
to the First Folk. Inform them we wish to pass, offering them no
harm, but that we will react savagely to any hostility.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will go myself,&quot; said Hein Huss. He
turned to Comandore, &quot;Lend me, if you will, your brash young
apprentice. I can put him to good use.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If he unmasks a nettle trap by blundering
into it, his first useful deed will be done,&quot; said Comandore. He
signaled to Sam Salazar, who came reluctantly forward. &quot;Walk in
front of Head Jinxman Hein Huss that he may encounter no traps or
scythes. Take a staff to probe the moss.&quot;</P>
<P>Without enthusiasm Sam Salazar borrowed a lance
from one of the foot soldiers. He and Huss set forth, along the low
rise that previously had separated North from South Wildwood.
Occasionally outcroppings of stone penetrated the cover of moss; here
and there grew bayberry trees, clumps of tarplant, ginger-tea, and
rosewort.</P>
<P>A half mile from the planting Huss halted. &quot;Now
take care, for here the traps will begin. Walk clear of hummocks,
these often conceal swing-scythes; avoid moss which shows a pale
blue; it is dying or sickly and may cover a deadfall or a nettle
trap.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why cannot you locate the traps by
clairvoyance?&quot; asked Sam Salazar in a rather sullen voice. &quot;It
appears an excellent occasion for the use of these faculties.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The question is natural,&quot; said Hein
Huss with composure. &quot;However you must know that when a
jinxman's own profit or security is at stake his emotions play tricks
on him. I would see traps everywhere and would never know whether
clairvoyance or fear prompted me. In this case, that lance is a more
reliable instrument than my mind.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar made a salute of understanding and set
forth, with Hein Huss stumping behind him. At first he prodded with
care, uncovering two traps, then advanced more jauntily; so swiftly
indeed that Huss called out in exasperation, &quot;Caution, unless
you court death!&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar obligingly slowed his pace. &quot;There
are traps all around us, but I detect the pattern, or so I believe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, ha, you do? Reveal it to me, if you
will. I am only Head Jinxman, and ignorant.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Notice. If we walk where the spore-pods have
recently been harvested, then we are secure.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss grunted. &quot;Forward then. Why do you
dally? We must do battle at Ballant Keep today.&quot;</P>
<P>Two hundred yards farther, Sam Salazar stopped
short. &quot;Go on, boy, go on!&quot; grumbled Hein Huss.</P>
<P>&quot;The savages threaten us. You can see them
just inside the planting. They hold tubes which they point toward
us.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss peered, then raised his head and called
out in the sibilant language of the First Folk.</P>
<P>A moment or two passed, then one of the creatures
came forth, a naked humanoid figure, ugly as a demonmask. Foam-sacs
bulged under its arms, orange-lipped foam-vents pointed forward. Its
back was wrinkled and loose, the skin serving as a bellows to blow
air through the foam-sacs. The fingers of the enormous hands ended in
chisel-shaped blades, the head was sheathed in chitin.
Billion-faceted eyes swelled from either side of the head, glowing
like black opals, merging without definite limit into the chitin.
This was a representative of the original inhabitants of the planet,
who until the coming of man had inhabited the downs, burrowing in the
moss, protecting themselves behind masses of foam exuded from the
underarm sacs.</P>
<P>The creature wandered close, halted. &quot;I speak
for Lord Faide of Faide Keep,&quot; said Huss. &quot;Your planting
bars his way. He wishes that you guide him through, so that his men
do not damage the trees, or spring the traps you have set against
your enemies.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Men are our enemies,&quot; responded the
autochthon. &quot;You may spring as many traps as you care to; that
is their purpose.&quot; It backed away.</P>
<P>&quot;One moment,&quot; said Hein Huss sternly.
&quot;Lord Faide must pass. He goes to battle Lord Ballant. He does
not wish to battle the First Folk. Therefore it is wise to guide him
across the planting without hindrance.&quot;</P>
<P>The creature considered a second or two. &quot;I
will guide him.&quot; He stalked across the moss toward the war
party.</P>
<P>Behind followed Hein Huss and Sam Salazar. The
autochthon, legs articulated more flexibly than a man's, seemed to
weave and wander, occasionally pausing to study the ground ahead.</P>
<P>&quot;I am puzzled,&quot; Sam Salazar told Hein
Huss. &quot;I cannot understand the creature's actions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Small wonder,&quot; grunted Hein Huss. &quot;He
is one of the First Folk, you are human. There is no basis for
understanding.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I disagree,&quot; said Sam Salazar
seriously.</P>
<P>&quot;Eh?&quot; Hein Huss inspected the apprentice
with vast disapproval. &quot;You engage in contention with me, Head
Jinxman Hein Huss?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Only in a limited sense,&quot; said Sam
Salazar. &quot;I see a basis for understanding with the First Folk in
our common ambition to survive.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A truism,&quot; grumbled Hein Huss.
&quot;Granting this community of interests with the First Folk, what
is your perplexity?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The fact that it first refused, then agreed
to conduct us across the planting.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss nodded. &quot;Evidently the information
which intervened, that we go to fight at Ballant Keep, occasioned the
change.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This is clear,&quot; said Sam Salazar. &quot;But
think<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You exhort me to think?&quot; roared Hein
Huss.</P>
<P>&quot;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>here
is one of the First Folk, apparently without distinction, who makes
an important decision instantly. Is he one of their leaders? Do they
live in anarchy?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is easy to put questions,&quot; Hein Huss
said gruffly. &quot;It is not as easy to answer them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In short<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In short, I do not know. In any event, they
are pleased to see us killing one another.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>III</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The passage through the planting was made without
incident. A mile to the east the autochthon stepped aside and without
formality returned to the forest. The war party, which had been
marching in single file, regrouped into its usual formation. Lord
Faide called Hein Huss and made the unusual gesture of inviting him
up into the seat beside him. The ancient car dipped and sagged; the
power-mechanism whined and chattered. Lord Faide, in high good
spirits, ignored the noise. &quot;I feared that we might be forced
into a time-consuming wrangle. What of Lord Ballant? Can you read his
thoughts?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss cast his mind forth. &quot;Not clearly.
He knows of our passage. He is disturbed.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide laughed sardonically. &quot;For
excellent reason! Listen now, I will explain the plan of battle so
that all may coordinate their efforts.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We approach in a wide line. Ballant's great
weapon is of course Volcano. A decoy must wear my armor and ride in
the lead. The yellow-haired apprentice is perhaps the most expendable
member of the party. In this way we will learn the potentialities of
Volcano. Like our own Hellmouth, it was built to repel vessels from
space and cannot command the ground immediately under the keep.
Therefore we will advance in dispersed formation, to regroup two
hundred yards from the keep. At this point the jinxmen will impel
Lord Ballant forth from the keep. You no doubt have made plans to
this end.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss gruffly admitted that such was the case.
Like other jinxmen, he enjoyed the pose that his power sufficed for
extemporaneous control of any situation.</P>
<P>Lord Faide was in no mood for niceties and pressed
for further information. Grudging each word, Hein Huss disclosed his
arrangements. &quot;I have prepared certain influences to discomfit
the Ballant defenders and drive them forth. Jinxman Enterlin will sit
at his cabinet, ready to retaliate if Lord Ballant orders a spell
against you. Anderson Grimes undoubtedly will cast a demon&mdash;probably
Everid&mdash;into the Ballant warriors; in return, Jinxman Comandore
will possess an equal or a greater number of Faide warriors with the
demon Keyril, who is even more ghastly and horrifying.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good. What more?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is need for no more, if your men fight
well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can you see the future? How does today end?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There are many futures. Certain
jinxmen&mdash;Enterlin for instance&mdash;profess to see the thread
which leads through the maze; they are seldom correct.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Call Enterlin here.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss rumbled his disapproval. &quot;Unwise,
if you desire victory over Ballant Keep.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide inspected the massive jinxman from
under his black saturnine brows. &quot;Why do you say this?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If Enterlin foretells defeat, you will be
dispirited and fight poorly. If he predicts victory, you become
overconfident and likewise fight poorly.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide made a petulant gesture. &quot;The
jinxmen are loud in their boasts until the test is made. Then they
always find reasons to retract, to qualify.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ha, ha!&quot; barked Hein Huss. &quot;You
expect miracles, not honest jinxmanship. I spit&mdash;&quot; he spat.
&quot;I predict that the spittle will strike the moss. The
probabilities are high. But an insect might fly in the way. One of
the First Folk might raise through the moss. The chances are slight.
In the next instant there is only one future. A minute hence there
are four futures. Five minutes hence, twenty futures. A billion
futures could not express all the possibilities of tomorrow. Of these
billion, certain are more probable than others. It is true that these
probable futures sometimes send a delicate influence into the
jinxman's brain. But unless he is completely impersonal and
disinterested, his own desires overwhelm this influence. Enterlin is
a strange man. He hides himself, he has no appetites. Occasionally
his auguries are exact. Nevertheless, I advise against consulting
him. You do better to rely on the practical and real vises of
jinxmanship.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide said nothing. The column had been
marching along the bottom of a low swale; the car had been sliding
easily downslope. Now they came to a rise, and the power-mechanism
complained so vigorously that Lord Faide was compelled to stop the
car. He considered. &quot;Once over the crest we will be in view of
Ballant Keep. Now we must disperse. Send the least valuable man in
your troupe forward&mdash; the apprentice who tested out the moss. He
must wear my helmet and corselet and ride in the car.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss alighted, returned to the wagons, and
presently Sam Salazar came forward. Lord Faide eyed the round, florid
face with distaste. &quot;Come close,&quot; he said crisply. Sam
Salazar obeyed. &quot;You will now ride in my place,&quot; said Lord
Faide. &quot;Notice carefully. This rod impels a forward motion. This
arm steers&mdash;to right, to left. To stop, return the rod to its
first position.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar pointed to some of the other arms,
toggles, switches, and buttons. &quot;What of these?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They are never used.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And these dials, what is their meaning?&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide curled his lip, on the brink of one of
his quick furies. &quot;Since their use is unimportant to me, it is
twenty times unimportant to you. Now. Put this cap on your head, and
this helmet. See to it that you do not sweat.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar gingerly settled the magnificent black
and green crest of Faide on his head, with a cloth cap underneath.</P>
<P>&quot;Now this corselet.&quot;</P>
<P>The corselet was constructed of green and black
metal sequins, with a pair of scarlet dragon-heads at either side of
the breast.</P>
<P>&quot;Now the cloak.&quot; Lord Faide flung the
black cloak over Sam Salazar's shoulders. &quot;Do not venture too
close to Ballant Keep. Your purpose is to attract the fire of
Volcano. Maintain a lateral motion around the keep, outside of dart
range. If you are killed by a dart, the whole purpose of the
deception is thwarted.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You prefer me to be killed by Volcano?&quot;
inquired Sam Salazar.</P>
<P>&quot;No. I wish to preserve the car and the
crest. These are relics of great value. Evade destruction by all
means possible. The ruse probably will deceive no one; but if it
does, and if it draws the fire of Volcano, I must sacrifice the Faide
car. Now&mdash;sit in my place.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar climbed into the car, settled himself
on the seat.</P>
<P>&quot;Sit straight,&quot; roared Lord Faide. &quot;Hold
your head up!</P>
<P>You are simulating Lord Faide! You must not appear
to slink!&quot; Sam Salazar heaved himself erect in the seat. 
</P>
<P>&quot;To simulate Lord Faide most effectively, I
should walk among the warriors, with someone else riding in the car.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide glared, then grinned sourly. &quot;No
matter. Do as I have commanded.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>IV</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Sixteen hundred years before, with war raging
through space, a group of space captains, their home bases destroyed,
had taken refuge on Pangborn. To protect themselves against vengeful
enemies, they built great forts armed with weapons from the
dismantled spaceships.</P>
<P>The wars receded, Pangborn was forgotten. The
newcomers drove the First Folk into the forests, planted and
harvested the river valleys. Ballant Keep, like Faide Keep, Castle
Cloud, Boghoten, and the rest, overlooked one of these valleys. Four
squat towers of a dense black substance supported an enormous parasol
roof, and were joined by walls two-thirds as high as the towers. At
the peak of the roof a cupola housed Volcano, the weapon
corresponding to Faide's Hellmouth.</P>
<P>The Faide war party advancing over the rise found
the great gates already secure, the parapets between the towers
thronged with bowmen. According to Lord Faide's strategy, the war
party advanced on a broad front. At the center rode Sam Salazar,
resplendent in Lord Faide's armor. He made, however, small effort to
simulate Lord Faide. Rather than sitting proudly erect, he crouched
at the side of the seat, the crest canted at an angle. Lord Faide
watched with disgust. Apprentice Salazar's reluctance to be
demolished was understandable; if his impersonation failed to
convince Lord Ballant, at least the Faide ancestral car might be
spared. For a certainty Volcano was being manned; the Ballant
weapon-tender could be seen in the cupola, and the snout protruded at
a menacing angle.</P>
<P>Apparently the tactic of dispersal, offering no
single tempting target, was effective. The Faide war party advanced
quickly to a point two hundred yards from the keep, below Volcano's
effective field, without drawing fire; first the knights, then the
foot soldiers, then the rumbling wagons of the magicians. The
slow-moving Faide car was far outdistanced; any doubt as to the
nature of the ruse must now be extinguished.</P>
<P>Apprentice Salazar, disliking the isolation, and
hoping to increase the speed of the car, twisted one of the other
switches, then another. From under the floor came a thin screeching
sound; the car quivered and began to rise. Sam Salazar peered over
the side, threw out a leg to jump. Lord Faide ran forward, gesturing
and shouting. Sam Salazar hastily drew back his leg, returned the
switches to their previous condition. The car dropped like a rock. He
snapped the switches up again, cushioning the fall.</P>
<P>&quot;Get out of that car!&quot; roared Lord
Faide. He snatched away the helmet, dealt Sam Salazar a buffet which
toppled him head over heels. &quot;Out of the armor; back to your
duties!&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar hurried to the jinxmen's wagons where
he helped erect Isak Comandore's black tent. Inside the tent a black
carpet with red and yellow patterns was laid; Comandore's cabinet,
his chair, and his chest were carried in, and incense set burning in
a censer. Directly in front of the main gate Hein Huss superintended
the assembly of a rolling stage, forty feet tall and sixty feet long,
the surface concealed from Ballant Keep by a tarpaulin.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Lord Faide had dispatched an emissary,
enjoining Lord Ballant to surrender. Lord Ballant delayed his
response, hoping to delay the attack as long as possible. If he could
maintain himself a day and a half, reinforcements from Gisborne Keep
and Castle Cloud might force Lord Faide to retreat.</P>
<P>Lord Faide waited only until the jinxmen had
completed their preparations, then sent another messenger, offering
two more minutes in which to surrender.</P>
<P>One minute passed, two minutes. The envoys turned
on their heels, marched back to the camp.</P>
<P>Lord Faide spoke to Hein Huss. &quot;You are
prepared?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am prepared,&quot; rumbled Hein Huss.</P>
<P>&quot;Drive them forth.&quot;</P>
<P>Huss raised his arm; the tarpaulin dropped from
the face of his great display, to reveal a painted representation of
Ballant Keep.</P>
<P>Huss retired to his tent, and pulled the flaps
together. Braziers burnt fiercely, illuminating the faces of Adam
McAdam, eight cabalmen, and six of the most advanced spellbinders.
Each worked at a bench supporting several dozen dolls and a small
glowing brazier. The cabalmen and spellbinders worked with dolls
representing Ballant men-at-arms; Huss and Adam McAdam employed
simulacra of the Ballant knights. Lord Ballant would not be hoodooed
unless he ordered a jinx against Lord Faide&mdash;a courtesy the
keep-lords extended each other.</P>
<P>Huss called out: &quot;Sebastian!&quot;</P>
<P>Sebastian, one of Huss's spellbinders, waiting at
the flap to the tent, replied, &quot;Ready, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Begin the display.&quot;</P>
<P>Sebastian ran to the stage, struck fire to a fuse.
Watchers inside Ballant Keep saw the depicted keep take fire. Flame
erupted from the windows, the roof glowed and crumbled. Inside the
tent the two jinxmen, the cabalmen, and the spellbinders methodically
took dolls, dipped them into the heat of the braziers, concentrating,
reaching out for the mind of the man whose doll they burnt. Within
the keep men became uneasy. Many began to imagine burning sensations,
which became more severe as their minds grew more sensitive to the
idea of fire. Lord Ballant noted the uneasiness. He signaled to his
chief jinxman Anderson Grimes. &quot;Begin the counterspell.&quot;</P>
<P>Down the front of the keep unrolled a display even
larger than Hein Huss's, depicting a hideous beast. It stood on four
legs and was shown picking up two men in a pair of hands, biting off
their heads. Grimes's cabalmen meanwhile took up dolls representing
the Faide warriors, inserted them into models of the depicted beast,
and closed the hinged jaws, all the while projecting ideas of fear
and disgust. And the Faide warriors, staring at the depicted monster,
felt a sense of horror and weakness.</P>
<P>Inside Huss's tent the braziers reeked and dolls
smoked. Eyes stared, brows glistened. From time to time one of the
workers gasped&mdash;signaling the entry of his projection into an
enemy mind. Within the keep warriors began to mutter, to slap at
burning skin, to eye each other fearfully, noting each other's
symptoms. Finally one cried out, and tore at his armor. &quot;I burn!
The cursed witches burn me!&quot; His pain aggravated the discomfort
of the others; there was a growing sound throughout the keep.</P>
<P>Lord Ballant's oldest son, his mind penetrated by
Hein Huss himself, struck his shield with his mailed fist. &quot;They
burn me! They burn us all! Better to fight than burn!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fight! Fight!&quot; came the voices of the
tormented men.</P>
<P>Lord Ballant looked around at the twisted faces,
some displaying blisters, scaldmarks. &quot;Our own spell terrifies
them; wait yet a moment!&quot; he pleaded.</P>
<P>His brother called hoarsely, &quot;It is not your
belly that Hein Huss toasts in the flames, it is mine! We cannot win
a battle of hoodoos; we must win a battle of arms!&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Ballant cried desperately, &quot;Wait, our
own effects are working! They will flee in terror; wait, wait!&quot;</P>
<P>His cousin tore off his corselet. &quot;It's Hein
Huss! I feel him! My leg's in the fire, the devil laughs at me. Next
my head, he says. Fight, or I go forth to fight alone!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Lord Ballant in a
fateful voice. &quot;We go forth to fight. First&mdash;the beast goes
forth. Then we follow and smite them in their terror.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The gates to the keep swung suddenly wide. Out
sprang what appeared to be the depicted monster: legs moving, arms
waving, eyes rolling, issuing evil sounds. Normally the Faide
warriors would have seen the monster for what it was: a model carried
on the backs of three horses. But their minds had been influenced;
they had been infected with horror; they drew back with arms hanging
flaccid. From behind the monster the Ballant knights galloped,
followed by the Ballant foot soldiers. The charge gathered momentum,
tore into the Faide center. Lord Faide bellowed orders; discipline
asserted itself. The Faide knights disengaged, divided into three
platoons, and engulfed the Ballant charge, while the foot soldiers
poured darts into the advancing ranks.</P>
<P>There was the clatter and surge of battle; Lord
Ballant, seeing that his sally had failed to overwhelm the Faide
forces, and thinking to conserve his own forces, ordered a retreat.
In good order the Ballant warriors began to back up toward the keep.
The Faide knights held close contact, hoping to win to the courtyard.
Close behind came a heavily loaded wagon pushed by armored horses, to
be wedged against the gate.</P>
<P>Lord Faide called an order; a reserve platoon of
ten knights charged from the side, thrust behind the main body of
Ballant horsemen, rode through the footsoldiers, fought into the
keep, cut down the gate-tenders.</P>
<P>Lord Ballant bellowed to Anderson Grimes, &quot;They
have won inside; quick with your cursed demon! If he can help us, let
him do so now!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Demon-possession is not a matter of an
instant,&quot; muttered the jinxman. &quot;I need time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have no time! Ten minutes and we're all
dead!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will do my best. Everid, Everid, come
swift!&quot;</P>
<P>He hastened into his workroom, donned his
demonmask, tossed handful after handful of incense into the brazier.
Against one wall stood a great form: black, slit-eyed, noseless.
Great white fangs hung from its upper palate; it stood on heavy bent
legs, arms reached forward to grasp. Anderson Grimes swallowed a cup
of syrup, paced slowly back and forth. A moment passed.</P>
<P>&quot;Grimes!&quot; came Ballant's call from
outside. &quot;Grimes!&quot;</P>
<P>A voice spoke. &quot;Enter without fear.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Ballant, carrying his ancestral side arm,
entered. He drew back with an involuntary sound. &quot;Grimes!&quot;
he whispered.</P>
<P>&quot;Grimes is not here,&quot; said the voice. &quot;I
am here. Enter.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Ballant came forward stiff-legged. The room
was dark except for the feeble glimmer of the brazier. Anderson
Grimes crouched in a corner, head bowed under his demon-mask. The
shadows twisted and pulsed with shapes and faces, forms struggling to
become solid. The black image seemed to vibrate with life.</P>
<P>&quot;Bring in your warriors,&quot; said the
voice. &quot;Bring them in five at a time, bid them look only at the
floor until commanded to raise their eyes.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Ballant retreated; there was no sound in the
room.</P>
<P>A moment passed; then five limp and exhausted
warriors filed into the room, eyes low.</P>
<P>&quot;Look slowly up,&quot; said the voice. &quot;Look
at the orange fire. Breathe deeply. Then look at me. I am Everid,
Demon of Hate. Look at me. Who am I?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are Everid, Demon of Hate,&quot;
quavered the warriors.</P>
<P>&quot;I stand all around you, in a dozen forms.
... I come closer. Where am I?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are close.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now I am you. We are together.&quot;</P>
<P>There was a sudden quiver of motion. The warriors
stood straighter, their faces distorted.</P>
<P>&quot;Go forth,&quot; said the voice. &quot;Go
quietly into the court. In a few minutes we march forth to slay.&quot;</P>
<P>The five stalked forth. Five more entered.</P>
<P>Outside the wall the Ballant knights had retreated
as far as the gate; within, seven Faide knights still survived, and
with their backs to the wall held the Ballant warriors away from the
gate mechanism.</P>
<P>In the Faide camp Huss called to Comandore,
&quot;Everid is walking. Bring forth Keyril.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Send the men,&quot; came Comandore's voice,
low and harsh. &quot;Send the men to me. I am Keyril.&quot;</P>
<P>Within the keep twenty warriors came marching into
the courtyard. Their steps were cautious, tentative, slow. Their
faces had lost individuality, they were twisted and distorted,
curiously alike.</P>
<P>&quot;Bewitched!&quot; whispered the Ballant
soldiers, drawing back. The seven Faide knights watched with sudden
fright. But the twenty warriors, paying them no heed, marched out the
gate.</P>
<P>The Ballant knights parted; for an instant there
was a lull in the fighting. The twenty sprang like tigers. Their
swords glistened, twinkling in water-bright arcs. They crouched,
jerked, jumped; Faide arms, legs, heads were hewed off. The twenty
were cut and battered, but the blows seemed to have no effect.</P>
<P>The Faide attack faltered, collapsed. The knights,
whose armor was no protection against the demoniac swords, retreated.
The twenty possessed warriors raced out into the open toward the foot
soldiers, running with great strides, slashing and rending. The Faide
foot soldiers fought for a moment, then they too gave way and turned
to flee.</P>
<P>From behind Comandore's tent appeared thirty Faide
warriors, marching stiffly, slowly. Like the Ballant twenty their
faces were alike&mdash;but between the Everid-possessed and the
Keyril-possessed was the difference between the face of Everid and
the face of Keyril.</P>
<P>Keyril and Everid fought, using the men as
weapons, without fear, retreat, or mercy. Hack, chop, cut. Arms,
legs, sundered torsos. Bodies fought headless for moments before
collapsing. Only when a body was minced, hacked to bits, did the
demoniac vitality depart. Presently there were no more men of Everid,
and only fifteen men of Keyril. These hopped and limped and tumbled
toward the keep where Faide knights still held the gate. The Ballant
knights met them in despair, knowing that now was the decisive
moment. Leaping, leering from chopped faces, slashing from tireless
arms, the warriors cut a hole into the iron. The Faide knights,
roaring victory cries, plunged after. Into the courtyard surged the
battle, and now there was no longer doubt of the outcome. Ballant
Keep was taken.</P>
<P>Back in his tent Isak Comandore took a deep
breath, shuddered, flung down his demonmask. In the courtyard the
twelve remaining warriors dropped in their tracks, twitched, gasped,
gushed blood and died.</P>
<P>Lord Ballant, in the last gallant act of a gallant
life, marched forth brandishing his ancestral side arm. He aimed
across the bloody field at Lord Faide, pulled the trigger. The weapon
spewed a brief gout of light; Lord Faide's skin prickled and hair
rose from his head. The weapon crackled, turned cherry red and
melted. Lord Ballant threw down the weapon, drew his sword, marched
forth to challenge Lord Faide.</P>
<P>Lord Faide, disinclined to unnecessary combat,
signaled his soldiers. A flight of darts ended Lord Ballant's life,
saving him the discomfort of formal execution.</P>
<P>There was no further resistance. The Ballant
defenders threw down their arms and marched grimly out to kneel
before Lord Faide, while inside the keep the Ballant women gave
themselves to mourning and grief.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>V</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Lord Faide had no wish to linger at Ballant Keep,
for he took no relish in his victories. Inevitably, a thousand
decisions had to be made. Six of the closest Ballant kinsmen were
summarily stabbed and the title declared defunct. Others of the clan
were offered a choice: an oath of lifelong fealty together with a
moderate ransom, or death. Only two, eyes blazing hate, chose death
and were instantly stabbed.</P>
<P>Lord Faide had now achieved his ambition. For over
a thousand years the keep-lords had struggled for power; now one, now
another gaining ascendancy. None before had ever extended his
authority across the entire continent&mdash; which meant control of
the planet, since all other land was either sun-parched rock or
eternal ice. Ballant Keep had long thwarted Lord Faide's drive to
power; now&mdash;success, total and absolute. It still remained to
chastise the lords of Castle Cloud and Gisborne, both of whom, seeing
opportunity to overwhelm Lord Faide, had ranged themselves behind
Lord Ballant. But these were matters that might well be assigned to
Hein Huss.</P>
<P>Lord Faide, for the first time in his life, felt a
trace of uncertainty. Now what? No real adversaries remained. The
First Folk must be whipped back, but here was no great problem; they
were numerous, but no more than savages.</P>
<P>He knew that dissatisfaction and controversy would
ultimately arise among his kinsmen and allies. Inaction and boredom
would breed irritability; idle minds would calculate the pros and
cons of mischief. Even the most loyal would remember the campaigns
with nostalgia and long for the excitement, the release, the license,
of warfare. Somehow he must find means to absorb the energy of so
many active and keyed-up men. How and where, this was the problem.
The construction of roads? New farmland claimed from the downs?
Yearly tournaments-at-arms? Lord Faide frowned at the inadequacy of
his solutions, but his imagination was impoverished by the lack of
tradition. The original settlers of Pangborn had been warriors, and
had brought with them a certain amount of practical rule-of-thumb
knowledge, but little else. The tales they passed down the
generations described the great spaceships which moved with magic
speed and certainty, the miraculous weapons, the wars in the void,
but told nothing of human history or civilized achievement. And so
Lord Faide, full of power and success, but with no goal toward which
to turn his strength, felt more morose and saturnine than ever.</P>
<P>He gloomily inspected the spoils from Ballant
Keep. They were of no great interest to him. Ballant's ancestral car
was no longer used, but displayed behind a glass case. He inspected
the weapon Volcano, but this could not be moved. In any event it was
useless, its magic lost forever. Lord Faide now knew that Lord
Ballant had ordered it turned against the Faide car, but that it had
refused to spew its vaunted fire. Lord Faide saw with disdainful
amusement that Volcano had been sadly neglected. Corrosion had pitted
the metal, careless cleaning had twisted the exterior tubing,
undoubtedly diminishing the potency of the magic. No such neglect at
Faide Keep! Jambart the weapon-tender cherished Hellmouth with
absolute devotion. Elsewhere were other ancient devices, interesting
but useless&mdash;the same sort of curios that cluttered shelves and
cases at Faide Keep. (Peculiar, these ancient men! thought Lord
Faide: at once so clever, yet so primitive and impractical.
Conditions had changed; there had been enormous advances since the
dark ages sixteen hundred years ago. For instance, the ancients had
used intricate fetishes of metal and glass to communicate with each
other. Lord Faide need merely voice his needs; Hein Huss could
project his mind a hundred miles to see, to hear, to relay Lord
Faide's words.) The ancients had contrived dozens of such objects,
but the old magic had worn away and they never seemed to function.
Lord Ballant's side arm had melted, after merely stinging Lord Faide.
Imagine a troop armed thus trying to cope with a platoon of
demon-possessed warriors! Slaughter of the innocents!</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Among the Ballant trove Lord Faide noted a dozen
old books and several reels of microfilm. The books were worthless,
page after page of incomprehensible jargon; the microfilm was equally
undecipherable. Again Lord Faide wondered skeptically about the
ancients. Clever of course, but to look at the hard facts, they were
little more advanced than the First Folk: neither had facility with
telepathy or voyance or demon-command. And the magic of the ancients:
might there not be a great deal of exaggeration in the legends?
Volcano, for instance. A joke. Lord Faide wondered about his own
Hellmouth. But no&mdash;surely Hellmouth was more trustworthy;
Jambart cleaned and polished the weapon daily and washed the entire
cupola with vintage wine every month. If human care could induce
faithfulness, then Hellmouth was ready to defend Faide Keep!</P>
<P>Now there was no longer need for defense. Faide
was supreme. Considering the future, Lord Faide made a decision.
There should no longer be keep-lords on Pangborn; he would abolish
the appellation. Habitancy of the keeps would gradually be
transferred to trusted bailiffs on a yearly basis. The former lords
would be moved to comfortable but indefensible manor houses, with the
maintenance of private troops forbidden. Naturally they must be
allowed jinxmen, but these would be made accountable to
himself&mdash;perhaps through some sort of licensing provision. He
must discuss the matter with Hein Huss. A matter for the future,
however. Now he merely wished to settle affairs and return to Faide
Keep.</P>
<P>There was little more to be done. The surviving
Ballant kinsmen he sent to their homes after Hein Huss had
impregnated fresh dolls with their essences. Should they default on
their ransoms, a twinge of fire, a few stomach cramps would more than
set them right. Ballant Keep itself Lord Faide would have liked to
burn&mdash;but the material of the ancients was proof to fire. But in
order to discourage any new pretenders to the Ballant heritage Lord
Faide ordered all the heirlooms and relics brought forth into the
courtyard, and then, one at a time, in order of rank, he bade his men
choose. Thus the Ballant wealth was distributed. Even the jinxmen
were invited to choose, but they despised the ancient trinkets as
works of witless superstition. The lesser spellbinders and
apprentices rummaged through the leavings, occasionally finding an
overlooked bauble or some anomalous implement. Isak Comandore was
irritated to find Sam Salazar staggering under a load of the ancient
books. &quot;And what is your purpose with these?&quot; he barked.
&quot;Why do you burden yourself with rubbish?&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar hung his head. &quot;I have no
definite purpose. Undoubtedly there was wisdom&mdash;or at least
knowledge&mdash;among the ancients; perhaps I can use these symbols
of knowledge to sharpen my own understanding.&quot;</P>
<P>Comandore threw up his hands in disgust. He turned
to Hein Huss who stood nearby. &quot;First he fancies himself a tree
and stands in the mud; now he thinks to learn jinxmanship through a
study of ancient symbols.&quot;</P>
<P>Huss shrugged. &quot;They were men like ourselves,
and, though limited, they were not entirely obtuse. A certain simian
cleverness is required to fabricate these objects.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Simian cleverness is no substitute for sound
jinxmanship,&quot; retorted Isak Comandore. &quot;This is a point
hard to overemphasize; I have drummed it into Salazar's head a
hundred times. And now, look at him.&quot;</P>
<P>Huss grunted noncommittally. &quot;I fail to
understand what he hopes to achieve.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar tried to explain, fumbling for words
to express an idea that did not exist. &quot;I thought perhaps to
decipher the writing, if only to understand what the ancients
thought, and perhaps to learn how to perform one or two of their
tricks.&quot;</P>
<P>Comandore rolled up his eyes. &quot;What enemy
bewitched me when I consented to take you as apprentice? I can cast
twenty hoodoos in an hour, more than any of the ancients could
achieve in a lifetime.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; said Sam Salazar, &quot;I
notice that Lord Faide rides in his ancestral car, and that Lord
Ballant sought to kill us all with Volcano.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I notice,&quot; said Comandore with feral
softness, &quot;that my demon Keyril conquered Lord Ballant's
Volcano, and that riding on my wagon I can outdistance Lord Faide in
his car.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar thought better of arguing further.
&quot;True, Jinxman Comandore, very true. I stand corrected.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then discard that rubbish and make yourself
useful. We return to Faide Keep in the morning.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As you wish, Jinxman Comandore.&quot; Sam
Salazar threw the books back into the trash.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>VI</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The Ballant clan had been dispersed, Ballant Keep
was despoiled. Lord Faide and his men banqueted somberly in the great
hall, tended by silent Ballant servitors.</P>
<P>Ballant Keep had been built on the same splendid
scale as Faide Keep. The great hall was a hundred feet long, fifty
feet wide, fifty feet high, paneled in planks sawn from pale native
hardwood, rubbed and waxed to a rich honey color. Enormous black
beams supported the ceiling; from these hung candelabra, intricate
contrivances of green, purple, and blue glass, knotted with ancient
but still bright light-motes. On the far wall hung portraits of all
the lords of Ballant Keep&mdash;105 grave faces in a variety of
costumes. Below, a genealogical chart ten feet high detailed the
descent of the Ballants and their connections with the other noble
clans. Now there was a desolate air to the hall, and the 105 dead
faces were meaningless and empty.</P>
<P>Lord Faide dined without joy, and cast dour side
glances at those of his kinsmen who reveled too gladly. Lord Ballant,
he thought, had conducted himself only as he himself might have done
under the same circumstances; coarse exultation seemed in poor taste,
almost as if it were disrespect for Lord Faide himself. His followers
were quick to catch his mood, and the banquet proceeded with greater
decorum. The jinxmen sat apart in a smaller room to the side.
Anderson Grimes, erstwhile Ballant Head Jinxman, sat beside Hein
Huss, trying to put a good face on his defeat. After all, he had
performed creditably against four powerful adversaries, and there was
no cause to feel a diminution of <I>mana. </I>The five jinxmen
discussed the battle, while the cabalmen and spellbinders listened
respectfully. The conduct of the demon-possessed troops occasioned
the most discussion. Anderson Grimes readily admitted that his
conception of Everid was a force absolutely brutal and blunt,
terrifying in its indomitable vigor. The other jinxmen agreed that he
undoubtedly succeeded in projecting these qualities; Hein Huss
however pointed out that Isak Comandore's Keyril, as cruel and
vigorous as Everid, also combined a measure of crafty malice, which
tended to make the possessed soldier a more effective weapon.</P>
<P>Anderson Grimes allowed that this might well be
the case, and that in fact he had been considering such an
augmentation of Everid's characteristics.</P>
<P>&quot;To my mind,&quot; said Huss, &quot;the most
effective demon should be swift enough to avoid the strokes of the
brute demons, such as Keyril and Everid. I cite my own Dant as
example. A Dant-possessed warrior can easily destroy a Keyril or an
Everid, simply through his agility. In an encounter of this sort the
Keyrils and Everids presently lose their capacity to terrify, and
thus half the effect is lost.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore pierced Huss with a hot russet
glance. &quot;You state a presumption as if it were fact. I have
formulated Keyril with sufficient craft to counter any such displays
of speed. I firmly believe Keyril to be the most fearsome of all
demons.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It may well be,&quot; rumbled Hein Huss
thoughtfully. He beckoned to a steward, gave instructions. The
steward reduced the light a trifle. &quot;Behold,&quot; said Hein
Huss. &quot;There is Dant. He comes to join the banquet.&quot; To the
side of the room loomed the tiger-striped Dant, a creature
constructed of resilient metal, with four terrible arms, and a squat
black head which seemed all gaping jaw.</P>
<P>&quot;Look,&quot; came the husky voice of Isak
Comandore. &quot;There is Keyril.&quot; Keyril was rather more
humanoid and armed with a cutlass. Dant spied Keyril. The jaws gaped
wider, it sprang to the attack.</P>
<P>The battle was a thing of horror; the two demons
rolled, twisted, bit, frothed, uttered soundless shrieks, tore each
other apart. Suddenly Dant sprang away, circled Keyril with dizzying
speed, faster, faster; became a blur, a wild coruscation of colors
that seemed to give off a high-pitched wailing sound, rising higher
and higher in pitch. Keyril hacked brutally with his cutlass, then
seemed to grow feeble and wan. The light that once had been Dant
blazed white, exploded in a mental shriek; Keyril was gone and Isak
Comandore lay moaning.</P>
<P>Hein Huss drew a deep breath, wiped his face,
looked about him with a complacent grin. The entire company sat rigid
as stones, staring, all except the apprentice Sam Salazar, who met
Hein Huss's glance with a cheerful smile.</P>
<P>&quot;So,&quot; growled Huss, panting from his
exertion, &quot;you consider yourself superior to the illusion; you
sit and smirk at one of Hein Huss's best efforts.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no,&quot; cried Sam Salazar, &quot;I
mean no disrespect! I want to learn, so I watched you rather than the
demons. What could they teach me? Nothing!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Huss, mollified. &quot;And
what did you learn?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Likewise, nothing,&quot; said Sam Salazar,
&quot;but at least I do not sit like a fish.&quot;</P>
<P>Comandore's voice came soft but crackling with
wrath. &quot;You see in me the resemblance to a fish?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I except you, Jinxman Comandore, naturally,&quot;
Sam Salazar explained.</P>
<P>&quot;Please go to my cabinet, Apprentice Salazar,
and fetch me the doll that is your likeness. The steward will bring a
basin of water, and we shall have some sport. With your knowledge of
fish you perhaps can breathe under water. If not&mdash; you may
suffocate.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I prefer not, Jinxman Comandore,&quot; said
Sam Salazar. &quot;In fact, with your permission, I now resign your
service.&quot;</P>
<P>Comandore motioned to one of his cabalmen. &quot;Fetch
me the Salazar doll. Since he is no longer my apprentice, it is
likely indeed that he will suffocate.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come now, Comandore,&quot; said Hein Huss
gruffly. &quot;Do not torment the lad. He is innocent and a trifle
addled. Let this be an occasion of placidity and ease.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, Hein Huss,&quot; said Comandore.
&quot;Why not? There is ample time in which to discipline this
upstart.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Jinxman Huss,&quot; said Sam Salazar, &quot;since
I am now relieved of my duties to Jinxman Comandore, perhaps you will
accept me into your service.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss made a noise of vast distaste. &quot;You
are not my responsibility.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There are many futures, Hein Huss,&quot;
said Sam Salazar. &quot;You have said as much yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss looked at Sam Salazar with his
water-clear eyes. &quot;Yes, there are many futures. And I think that
tonight sees the full amplitude of jinxmanship. ... I think that
never again will such power and skill gather at the same table. We
shall die one by one and there shall be none to fill our shoes. . . .
Yes, Sam Salazar. I will take you as apprentice. Isak Comandore, do
you hear? This youth is now of my company.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I must be compensated,&quot; growled
Comandore. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You have coveted my doll of Tharon Faide,
the only one in existence. It is yours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, ha!&quot; cried Isak Comandore leaping
to his feet. &quot;Hein Huss, I salute you! You are generous indeed!
I thank you and accept!&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss motioned to Sam Salazar. &quot;Move your
effects to my wagon. Do not show your face again tonight.&quot; Sam
Salazar bowed with dignity and departed the hall. The banquet
continued, but now something of melancholy filled the room. Presently
a messenger from Lord Faide came to warn all to bed, for the party
returned to Faide Keep at dawn.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>VII</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The victorious Faide troops gathered on the heath
before Ballant Keep. As a parting gesture Lord Faide ordered the
great gate torn off the hinges, so that ingress could never again be
denied him. But even after sixteen hundred years the hinges were
proof to all the force the horses could muster, and the gates
remained in place.</P>
<P>Lord Faide accepted the fact with good grace and
bade farewell to his cousin Renfroy, whom he had appointed bailiff.
He climbed into his car, settled himself, snapped the switch. The car
groaned and moved forward. Behind came the knights and the foot
soldiers, then the baggage train, laden with booty, and finally the
wagons of the jinxmen.</P>
<P>Three hours the column marched across the mossy
downs. Ballant Keep dwindled behind; ahead appeared North and South
Wildwood, darkening all the sweep of the western horizon. Where once
the break had existed, the First Folk's new planting showed a smudge
lower and less intense than the old woodlands.</P>
<P>Two miles from the woodlands Lord Faide called a
halt and signaled up his knights. Hein Huss laboriously dismounted
from his wagon, came forward.</P>
<P>&quot;In the event of resistance,&quot; Lord Faide
told the knights, &quot;do not be tempted into the forest. Stay with
the column and at all times be on your guard against traps.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss spoke. &quot;You wish me to parley with
the First Folk once more?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; said Lord Faide. &quot;It is
ridiculous that I must ask permission of savages to ride over my own
land. We return as we came; if they interfere, so much the worse for
them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are rash,&quot; said Huss with simple
candor.</P>
<P>Lord Faide glanced down at him with black eyebrows
raised. &quot;What damage can they do if we avoid their traps? Blow
foam at us?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is not my place to advise or to warn,&quot;
said Hein Huss. &quot;However, I point out that they exhibit a
confidence which does not come from conscious weakness; also, that
they carried tubes, apparently hollow grasswood shoots, which imply
missiles.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide nodded. &quot;No doubt. However, the
knights wear armor, the soldiers carry bucklers. It is not fit that
I, Lord Faide of Faide Keep, choose my path to suit the whims of the
First Folk. This must be made clear, even if the exercise involves a
dozen or so First Folk corpses.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Since I am not a fighting man,&quot;
remarked Hein Huss, &quot;I will keep well to the rear, and pass only
when the way is secure.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As you wish.&quot; Lord Faide pulled down
the visor of his helmet. &quot;Forward.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The column moved toward the forest, along the
previous track, which showed plain across the moss. Lord Faide rode
in the lead, flanked by his brother, Gethwin Faide, and his cousin,
Mauve Dermont-Faide.</P>
<P>A half mile passed, and another. The forest was
only a mile distant. Overhead the great sun rode at zenith;
brightness and heat poured down; the air carried the oily scent of
thorn and tarbush. The column moved on, more slowly; the only sound
the clanking of armor, the muffled thud of hooves in the moss, the
squeal of wagon wheels.</P>
<P>Lord Faide rose up in his car, watching for any
sign of hostile preparation. A half mile from the planting the forms
of the First Folk, waiting in the shade along the forest's verge,
became visible. Lord Faide ignored them, held a steady pace along the
track they had traveled before.</P>
<P>The half-mile became a quarter-mile. Lord Faide
turned to order the troops into single file and was just in time to
see a hole suddenly open into the moss and his brother, Gethwin
Faide, drop from sight. There was a rattle, a thud, the howling of
the impaled horse; Gethwin's wild calls as the horse kicked and
crushed him into the stakes. Mauve Dermont-Faide, riding beside
Gethwin, could not control his own horse, which leaped aside from the
pit and blundered upon a trigger. Up from the moss burst a tree trunk
studded with foot-long thorns. It snapped, quick as a scorpion's
tail; the thorns punctured Mauve Dermont-Faide's armor, his chest,
and whisked him from his horse to carry him suspended, writhing and
screaming. The tip of the scythe pounded into Lord Faide's car,
splintered against the hull. The car swung groaning through the air.
Lord Faide clutched at the windscreen to prevent himself from
falling.</P>
<P>The column halted; several men ran to the pit, but
Gethwin Faide lay twenty feet below, crushed under his horse. Others
took Mauve Dermont-Faide down from the swaying scythe, but he, too,
was dead.</P>
<P>Lord Faide's skin tingled with a gooseflesh of
hate and rage. He looked toward the forest. The First Folk stood
motionless. He beckoned to Bernard, sergeant of the foot soldiers.
&quot;Two men with lances to try out the ground ahead. All others
ready with darts. At my signal spit the devils.&quot;</P>
<P>Two men came forward, and marching before Lord
Faide's car, probed at the ground. Lord Faide settled in his seat.
&quot;Forward.&quot;</P>
<P>The column moved slowly toward the forest, every
man tense and ready. The lances of the two men in the vanguard
presently broke through the moss, to disclose a nettle trap&mdash; a
pit lined with nettles, each frond ripe with globes of acid.
Carefully they probed out a path to the side, and the column filed
around, each man walking in the other's tracks.</P>
<P>At Lord Faide's side now rode his two nephews,
Scolford and Edwin. &quot;Notice,&quot; said Lord Faide in a voice
harsh and tight. &quot;These traps were laid since our last passage;
an act of malice.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But why did they guide us through before?&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide smiled bitterly. &quot;They were
willing that we should die at Ballant Keep. But we have disappointed
them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Notice, they carry tubes,&quot; said
Scolford.</P>
<P>&quot;Blowguns possibly,&quot; suggested Edwin.</P>
<P>Scolford disagreed. &quot;They cannot blow through
their foam-vents.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No doubt we shall soon learn,&quot; said
Lord Faide. He rose in his seat, called to the rear. &quot;Ready with
the darts!&quot;</P>
<P>The soldiers raised their crossbows. The column
advanced slowly, now only a hundred yards from the planting. The
white shapes of the First Folk moved uneasily at the forest's edges.
Several of them raised their tubes, seemed to sight along the length.
They twitched their great hands.</P>
<P>One of the tubes was pointed toward Lord Faide. He
saw a small black object leave the opening, flit forward, gathering
speed. He heard a hum, waxing to a rasping, clicking flutter. He
ducked behind the windscreen; the projectile swooped in pursuit,
struck the windscreen like a thrown stone. It fell crippled upon the
forward deck of the car&mdash;a heavy black insect like a wasp, its
broken proboscis oozing ocher liquid, horny wings beating feebly,
eyes like dumbbells fixed on Lord Faide. With his mailed fist, he
crushed the creature.</P>
<P>Behind him other wasps struck knights and men;
Corex Faide-Battaro took the prong through his visor into the eye,
but the armor of the other knights defeated the wasps. The foot
soldiers, however, lacked protection; the wasps half buried
themselves in flesh. The soldiers called out in pain, clawed away the
wasps, squeezed the wounds. Corex Faide-Battaro toppled from his
horse, ran blindly out over the heath, and after fifty feet fell into
a trap. The stricken soldiers began to twitch, then fell on the moss,
thrashed, leaped up to run with flapping arms, threw themselves in
wild somersaults, forward, backward, foaming and thrashing.</P>
<P>In the forest, the First Folk raised their tubes
again. Lord Faide bellowed, &quot;Spit the creatures! Bowmen, launch
your darts!&quot;</P>
<P>There came the twang of crossbows, darts snapped
at the quiet white shapes. A few staggered and wandered aimlessly
away; most, however, plucked out the darts or ignored them. They took
capsules from small sacks, put them to the end of their tubes.</P>
<P>&quot;Beware the wasps!&quot; cried Lord Faide.
&quot;Strike with your bucklers! Kill the cursed things in flight!&quot;</P>
<P>The rasp of horny wings came again; certain of the
soldiers found courage enough to follow Lord Faide's orders, and
battered down the wasps. Others struck home as before; behind came
another flight. The column became a tangle of struggling, crouching
men.</P>
<P>&quot;Footmen, retreat!&quot; called Lord Faide
furiously. &quot;Footmen back! Knights to me!&quot;</P>
<P>The soldiers fled back along the track, taking
refuge behind the baggage wagons. Thirty of their number lay dying,
or dead, on the moss.</P>
<P>Lord Faide cried out to his knights in a voice
like a bugle. &quot;Dismount, follow slow after me! Turn your
helmets, keep the wasps from your eyes! One step at a time, behind
the car! Edwin, into the car beside me, test the footing with your
lance. Once in the forest there are no traps! Then attack!&quot;</P>
<P>The knights formed themselves into a line behind
the car. Lord Faide drove slowly forward, his kinsman Edwin prodding
the ground ahead. The First Folk sent out a dozen more wasps, which
dashed themselves vainly against the armor. Then there was silence .
. . cessation of sound, activity. The First Folk watched impassively
as the knights approached, step by step.</P>
<P>Edwin's lance found a trap, the column moved to
the side. Another trap&mdash;and the column was diverted from the
planting toward the forest. Step by step, yard by yard&mdash;another
trap, another detour, and now the column was only a hundred feet from
the forest. A trap to the left, a trap to the right: the safe path
led directly toward an enormous heavy-branched tree. Seventy feet,
fifty feet, then Lord Faide drew his sword.</P>
<P>&quot;Prepare to charge, kill till your arms
tire!&quot;</P>
<P>From the forest came a crackling sound. The
branches of the great tree trembled and swayed. The knights stared,
for a moment frozen into place. The tree toppled forward, the knights
madly tried to flee&mdash;to the rear, to the sides. Traps opened;
the knights dropped upon sharp stakes. The tree fell; boughs cracked
armored bodies like nuts; there was the hoarse yelling of pinned men,
screams from the traps, the crackling subsidence of breaking
branches. Lord Faide had been battered down into the car, and the car
had been pressed groaning into the moss. His first instinctive act
was to press the switch to rest position; then he staggered erect,
clambered up through the boughs. A pale unhuman face peered at him;
he swung his fist, crushed the faceted eye-bulge, and roaring with
rage scrambled through the branches. Others of his knights were
working themselves free, although almost a third were either crushed
or impaled.</P>
<P>The First Folk came scrambling forward, armed with
enormous thorns, long as swords. But now Lord Faide could reach them
at close quarters. Hissing with vindictive joy he sprang into their
midst, swinging his sword with both hands, as if demon-possessed. The
surviving knights joined him and the ground became littered with
dismembered First Folk. They drew back slowly, without excitement.
Lord Faide reluctantly called back his knights. &quot;We must succor
those still pinned, as many as still are alive.&quot;</P>
<P>As well as possible branches were cut away,
injured knights drawn forth. In some cases the soft moss had
cushioned the impact of the tree. Six knights were dead, another four
crushed beyond hope of recovery. To these Lord Faide himself gave the
<I>coup de grace. </I>Ten minutes further hacking and chopping freed
Lord Faide's car, while the First Folk watched incuriously from the
forest. The knights wished to charge once more, but Lord Faide
ordered retreat. Without interference they returned the way they had
come, back to the baggage train.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Lord Faide ordered a muster. Of the original war
party, less than two-thirds remained. Lord Faide shook his head
bitterly. Galling to think how easily he had been led into a trap! He
swung on his heel, strode to the rear of the column, to the wagons of
the magicians. The jinxmen sat around a small fire, drinking tea.
&quot;Which of you will hoodoo these white forest vermin? I want them
dead&mdash;stricken with sickness, cramps, blindness, the most
painful afflictions you can contrive!&quot;</P>
<P>There was general silence. The jinxmen sipped
their tea.</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot; demanded Lord Faide. &quot;Have
you no answer? Do I not make myself plain?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss cleared his throat, spat into the blaze.
&quot;Your wishes are plain. Unfortunately we cannot hoodoo the First
Folk.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And why?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There are technical reasons.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide knew the futility of argument. &quot;Must
we slink home around the forest? If you cannot hoodoo the First Folk,
then bring out your demons! I will march on the forest and chop out a
path with my sword!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is not for me to suggest tactics,&quot;
grumbled Hein Huss.</P>
<P>&quot;Go on, speak! I will listen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A suggestion has been put to me, which I
will pass to you. Neither I nor the other jinxmen associate ourselves
with it, since it recommends the crudest of physical principles.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I await the suggestion,&quot; said Lord
Faide.</P>
<P>&quot;It is merely this. One of my apprentices
tampered with your car, as you may remember.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and I will see he gets the hiding he
deserves.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By some freak he caused the car to rise high
into the air. The suggestion is this: that we load the car with as
much oil as the baggage train affords, that we send the car aloft and
let it drift over the planting. At a suitable moment, the occupant of
the car will pour the oil over the trees, then hurl down a torch. The
forest will burn. The First Folk will be at least discomfited; at
best a large number will be destroyed.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide slapped his hands together. &quot;Excellent!
Quickly, to work!&quot; He called a dozen soldiers, gave them orders;
four kegs of cooking oil, three buckets of pitch, six demijohns of
spirit were brought and lifted into the car. The engines grated and
protested, and the car sagged almost to the moss.</P>
<P>Lord Faide shook his head sadly. &quot;A rude use
of the relic, but all in good purpose. Now, where is that apprentice?
He must indicate which switches and which buttons he turned.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I suggest,&quot; said Hein Huss, &quot;that
Sam Salazar be sent up with the car.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide looked sidewise at Sam Salazar's round,
bland countenance. &quot;An efficient hand is needed, a seasoned
judgment. I wonder if he can be trusted?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I would think so,&quot; said Hein Huss,
&quot;inasmuch as it was Sam Salazar who evolved the scheme in the
first place.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well. In with you, Apprentice! Treat my
car with reverence! The wind blows away from us; fire this edge of
the forest, in as long a strip as you can manage. The torch, where is
the torch?&quot;</P>
<P>The torch was brought and secured to the side of
the car.</P>
<P>&quot;One more matter,&quot; said Sam Salazar. &quot;I
would like to borrow the armor of some obliging knight, to protect
myself from the wasps. Otherwise<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Armor!&quot; bawled Lord Faide. &quot;Bring
armor!&quot;</P>
<P>At last, fully accoutered and with visor down, Sam
Salazar climbed into the car. He seated himself, peered intently at
the buttons and switches. In truth <I>he </I>was not precisely
certain as to which he had manipulated before. . . . He considered,
reached forward, pushed, turned. The motors roared and screamed; the
car shuddered, sluggishly rose into the air. Higher, higher, twenty
feet, forty feet, sixty feet&mdash;a hundred, two hundred. The wind
eased the car toward the forest; in the shade the First Folk watched.
Several of them raised tubes, opened the shutters. The onlookers saw
the wasps dart through the air to dash against Sam Salazar's armor.</P>
<P>The car drifted over the trees; Sam Salazar began
ladling out the oil. Below, the First Folk stirred uneasily. The wind
carried the car too far over the forest; Sam Salazar worked the
controls, succeeded in guiding himself back. One keg was empty, and
another; he tossed them out, presently emptied the remaining two, and
the buckets of pitch. He soaked a rag in spirit, ignited it, threw it
over the side, poured the spirit after. The flaming rag fell into
leaves. A crackle, fire blazed and sprang. The car now floated at a
height of five hundred feet. Salazar poured over the remaining
spirits, dropped the demijohns, guided the car back over the heath,
and fumbling nervously with the controls dropped the car in a series
of swoops back to the moss.</P>
<P>Lord Faide sprang forward, clapped him on the
shoulder. &quot;Excellently done! The forest blazes like tinder!&quot;</P>
<P>The men of Faide Keep stood back, rejoicing to see
the flames soar and lick. The First Folk scurried back from the heat,
waving their arms; foam of a peculiar purple color issued from their
vents as they ran, small useless puffs discharged as if by accident
or through excitement. The flames ate through first the forest, then
spread into the new planting, leaping through the leaves.</P>
<P>&quot;Prepare to march!&quot; called Lord Faide.
&quot;We pass directly behind the flames, before the First Folk
return.&quot;</P>
<P>Off in the forest the First Folk perched in the
trees, blowing out foam in great puffs and billows, building a wall
of insulation. The flames had eaten half across the new planting,
leaving behind smoldering saplings.</P>
<P>&quot;Forward! Briskly!&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The column moved ahead. Coughing in the smoke,
eyes smarting, they passed under still blazing trees and came out on
the western downs.</P>
<P>Slowly the column moved forward, led by a pair of
soldiers prodding the moss with lances. Behind followed Lord Faide
with the knights, then came the foot soldiers, then the rumbling
baggage train, and finally the six wagons of the jinxmen.</P>
<P>A thump, a creak, a snap. A scythe had broken up
from the moss; the soldiers in the lead dropped flat; the scythe
whipped past, a foot from Lord Faide's face. At the same time a
plaintive cry came from the rear guard. &quot;They pursue! The First
Folk come!&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide turned to inspect the new threat. A
clot of First Folk, two hundred or more, came across the moss, moving
without haste of urgency. Some carried wasp tubes, others
thorn-rapiers.</P>
<P>Lord Faid looked ahead. Another hundred yards
should bring the army out upon safe ground; then he could deploy and
maneuver. &quot;Forward!&quot;</P>
<P>The column proceeded, the baggage train and the
jinx-men's wagons pressing close up against the soldiers. Behind and
to the side came the First Folk, moving casually and easily.</P>
<P>At last Lord Faide judged they had reached secure
ground. &quot;Forward, now! Bring the wagons out, hurry now!&quot;</P>
<P>The troops needed no urging; they trotted out over
the heath, the wagons trundling after. Lord Faide ordered the wagons
into a close double line, stationed the soldiers between, with the
horses behind and protected from the wasps. The knights, now
dismounted, waited in front.</P>
<P>The First Folk came listlessly, formlessly
forward. Blank white faces stared; huge hands grasped tubes and
thorns; traces of the purplish foam showed at the lips of their
underarm orifices.</P>
<P>Lord Faide walked along the line of knights.
&quot;Swords ready. Allow them as close as they care to come. Then a
quick charge.&quot; He motioned to the foot soldiers. &quot;Choose a
target. . . !&quot; A volley of darts whistled overhead, to plunge
into white bodies. With chisel-bladed fingers the First Folk plucked
them out, discarded them with no evidence of vexation. One or two
staggered, wandered confusedly across the line of approach. Others
raised their tubes, withdrew the shutter. Out flew the insects, horny
wings rasping, prongs thrust forward. Across the moss they flickered,
to crush themselves against the armor of the knights, to drop to the
ground, to be stamped upon. The soldiers cranked their crossbows back
into tension, discharged another flight of darts, caused several more
First Folk casualties.</P>
<P>The First Folk spread into a long line,
surrounding the Faide troops. Lord Faide shifted half his knights to
the other side of the wagons.</P>
<P>The First Folk wandered closer. Lord Faide called
for a charge. The knights stepped smartly forward, swords swinging.
The First Folk advanced a few more steps, then stopped short. The
flaps of skin at their backs swelled, pulsed; white foam gushed
through their vents; clouds and billows rose up around them. The
knights halted uncertainly, prodding and slashing into the foam but
finding nothing. The foam piled higher, rolling in and forward,
pushing the knights back toward the wagons. They looked questioningly
toward Lord Faide.</P>
<P>Lord Faide waved his sword. &quot;Cut through to
the other side! Forward!&quot; Slashing two-handed with his sword, he
sprang into the foam. He struck something solid, hacked blindly at
it, pushed forward. Then his legs were seized; he was upended and
fell with a spine-rattling jar. Now he felt the grate of a thorn
searching his armor. It found a crevice under his corselet and
pierced him. Cursing he raised on his hands and knees, and plunged
blindly forward. Enormous hard hands grasped him, heavy forms fell on
his shoulders. He tried to breathe, but the foam clogged his visor;
he began to smother. Staggering to his feet he half ran, half fell
out into the open air, carrying two of the First Folk with him. He
had lost his sword, but managed to draw his dagger. The First Folk
released him and stepped back into the foam. Lord Faide sprang to his
feet. Inside the foam came the sounds of combat; some of his knights
burst into the open; others called for help. Lord Faide motioned to
the knights. &quot;Back within; the devils slaughter our kinsmen! In
and on to the center!&quot;</P>
<P>He took a deep breath. Seizing his dagger he
thrust himself back into the foam. A flurry of shapes came at him: he
pounded with his fists, cut with his dagger, stumbled over a mass of
living tissue. He kicked the softness, and stepped on metal. Bending,
he grasped a leg but found it limp and dead. First Folk were on his
back, another thorn found its mark; he groaned and thrust himself
forward, and once again fell out into the open air.</P>
<P>A scant fifty of his knights had won back into the
central clearing. Lord Faide cried out, &quot;To the center; mount
your horses!&quot; Abandoning his car, he himself vaulted into a
saddle. The foam boiled and billowed closer. Lord Faide waved his
arm. &quot;Forward, all; at a gallop! After us the wagons&mdash;out
into the open!&quot;</P>
<P>They charged, thrusting the frightened horses into
the foam. There was white blindness, the feel of forms underneath,
then the open air once again. Behind came the wagons, and the foot
soldiers, running along the channel cut by the wagons. All won
free&mdash;all but the knights who had fallen under the foam.</P>
<P>Two hundred yards from the great white clot of
foam, Lord Faide halted, turned, looked back. He raised his fist,
shook it in a passion. &quot;My knights, my car, my honor! I'll burn
your forests, I'll drive you into the sea, there'll be no peace till
all are dead!&quot; He swung around. &quot;Come,&quot; he called
bitterly to the remnants of his war party. &quot;We have been
defeated. We retreat to Faide Keep.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>VIII</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Faide Keep, like Ballant Keep, was constructed of
a black, glossy substance, half metal, half stone, impervious to
heat, force, and radiation. A parasol roof, designed to ward off
hostile energy, rested on five squat outer towers, connected by walls
almost as high as the lip of the overhanging roof.</P>
<P>The homecoming banquet was quiet and morose. The
soldiers and knights ate lightly and drank much, but instead of
becoming merry, lapsed into gloom. Lord Faide, overcome by emotion,
jumped to his feet. &quot;Everyone sits silent, aching with rage. I
feel no differently. We shall take revenge. We shall put the forests
to the torch. The cursed white savages will smother and burn. Drink
now with good cheer; not a moment will be wasted. But we must be
ready. It is no more than idiocy to attack as before. Tonight I take
council with the jinxmen, and we will start a program of affliction.&quot;</P>
<P>The soldiers and knights rose to their feet,
raised their cups and drank a somber toast. Lord Faide bowed and left
the hall.</P>
<P>He went to his private trophy room. On the walls
hung escutcheons, memorials, deathmasks, clusters of swords like
many-petaled flowers; a rack of side arms, energy pistols, electric
stilettos; a portrait of the original Faide, in ancient spacefarer's
uniform, and a treasured, almost unique, photograph of the great ship
that had brought the first Faide to Pangborn.</P>
<P>Lord Faide studied the ancient face for several
moments, then summoned a servant. &quot;Ask the Head Jinxman to
attend me.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss presently stumped into the room. Lord
Faide turned away from the portrait, seated himself, motioned to Hein
Huss to do likewise. &quot;What of the keep-lords?&quot; he asked.
&quot;How do they regard the setback at the hands of the First Folk?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There are various reactions,&quot; said Hein
Huss. &quot;At Boghoten, Candelwade, and Havve there is distress and
anger.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide nodded. &quot;These are my kinsmen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At Gisborne, Graymar, Castle Cloud, and
Alder there is satisfaction, veiled calculation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To be expected,&quot; muttered Lord Faide.
&quot;These lords must be humbled; in spite of oaths and
undertakings, they still think rebellion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At Star Home, Julian-Douray, and Oak Hall I
read surprise at the abilities of the First Folk, but in the main
disinterest.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide nodded sourly. &quot;Well enough. There
is no actual rebellion in prospect; we are free to concentrate on the
First Folk. I will tell you what is in my mind. You report that new
plantings are in progress between Wildwood, Old Forest, Sarrow Copse,
and elsewhere&mdash;possibly with the intent of surrounding Faide
Keep.&quot; He looked inquiringly at Hein Huss, but no comment was
forthcoming. Lord Faide continued. &quot;Possibly we have
underestimated the cunning of the savages. They seem capable of
forming plans and acting with almost human persistence. Or, I should
say, more than human persistence, for it appears that after sixteen
hundred years they still consider us invaders and hope to exterminate
us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is my own conclusion,&quot; said Hein
Huss.</P>
<P>&quot;We must take steps to strike first. I
consider this a matter for the jinxmen. We gain no honor dodging
wasps, falling into traps, or groping through foam. It is a needless
waste of lives. Therefore, I want you to assemble your jinxmen,
cabalmen, and spellbinders; I want you to formulate your most potent
hoodoos<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide's black eyebrows rose high. &quot;
'Impossible'?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss seemed vaguely uncomfortable. &quot;I
read the wonder in your mind. You suspect me of disinterest,
irresponsibility. Not true. If the First Folk defeat you, we suffer
likewise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Lord Faide dryly. &quot;You
will starve.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nevertheless, the jinxmen cannot help you.&quot;
He hoisted himself to his feet, started for the door.</P>
<P>&quot;Sit,&quot; said Lord Faide. &quot;It is
necessary to pursue this matter.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss looked around with his bland,
water-clear eyes. Lord Faide met his gaze. Hein Huss sighed deeply.
&quot;I see I must ignore the precepts of my trade, break the habits
of a lifetime. I must explain.&quot; He took his bulk to the wall,
fingered the side arms in the rack, studied the portrait of the
ancestral Faide. &quot;These miracle workers of the old times&mdash;
unfortunately we cannot use their magic! Notice the bulk of the
spaceship! As heavy as Faide Keep.&quot; He turned his gaze on the
table, teleported a candelabra two or three inches. &quot;With
considerably less effort they gave that spaceship enormous velocity,
using ideas and forces they knew to be imaginary and irrational. We
have advanced since then, of course. We no longer employ mysteries,
arcane constructions, wild nonhuman forces. We are rational and
practical&mdash;but we cannot achieve the effects of the ancient
magicians.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide watched Hein Huss with saturnine eyes.
Hein Huss gave his deep rumbling laugh. &quot;You think that I wish
to distract you with talk? No, this is not the case. I am preparing
to enlighten you.&quot; He returned to his seat, lowered his bulk
with a groan. &quot;Now I must talk at length, to which I am not
accustomed. But you must be given to understand what we jinxmen can
do and what we cannot do.</P>
<P>&quot;First, unlike the ancient magicians, we are
practical men. Naturally there is difference in our abilities. The
best jinxman combines great telepathic facility, implacable personal
force, and intimate knowledge of his fellow humans. He knows their
acts, motives, desires, and fears; he understands the symbols that
most vigorously represent these qualities. Jinxmanship in the main is
drudgery&mdash;dangerous, difficult, and unromantic&mdash;with no
mystery except that which we employ to confuse our enemies.&quot;
Hein Huss glanced at Lord Faide to encounter the same saturnine gaze.
&quot;Ha! I still have told you nothing; I still have spent many
words talking around my inability to confound the First Folk.
Patience.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak on,&quot; said Lord Faide.</P>
<P>&quot;Listen then. What happens when I hoodoo a
man? First I must enter into his mind telepathically. There are three
operational levels: the conscious, the unconscious, the cellular. The
most effective jinxing is done if all three levels are influenced. I
feel into my victim, I learn as much as possible, supplementing my
previous knowledge of him, which is part of my stock in trade. I take
up his doll, which carries his traces. The doll is highly useful but
not indispensable. It serves as a focus for my attention; it acts as
a pattern, or a guide, as I fix upon the mind of the victim, and he
is bound by his own telepathic capacity to the doll which bears his
traces.</P>
<P>&quot;So! Now! Man and doll are identified in my
mind, and at one or more levels in the victim's mind. Whatever
happens to the doll the victim feels to be happening to himself.
There is no more to simple hoodooing than that, from the standpoint
of the jinxman. But naturally the victims differ greatly.
Susceptibility is the key idea here. Some men are more susceptible
than others. Fear and conviction breed susceptibility. As a jinxman
succeeds he becomes ever more feared, and consequently the more
efficacious he becomes. The process is self-generative.</P>
<P>&quot;Demon-possession is a similar technique.
Susceptibility is again essential; again conviction creates
susceptibility. It is easiest and most dramatic when the
characteristics of the demon are well known, as in the case of
Comandore's Keyril. For this reason, demons can be exchanged or
traded among jinxmen. The commodity actually traded is public
acceptance and familiarity with the demon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Demons then do not actually exist?&quot;
inquired Lord Faide half-incredulously.</P>
<P>Hein Huss grinned vastly, showing enormous yellow
teeth. &quot;Telepathy works through a superstratum. Who knows what
is created in this superstratum? Maybe the demons live on after they
have been conceived; maybe they now are real. This of course is
speculation, which we jinxmen shun.</P>
<P>&quot;So much for demons, so much for the lesser
techniques of jinxmanship. I have explained sufficient to serve as
background to the present situation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Excellent,&quot; said Lord Faide.
&quot;Continue.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The question, then, is: How does one cast a
hoodoo into a creature of an alien race?&quot; He looked inquiringly
at Lord Faide. &quot;Can you tell me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I?&quot; asked Lord Faide surprised. &quot;No.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The method is basically the same as in the
hoodooing of men. It is necessary to make the creature believe, in
every cell of his being, that he suffers or dies. This is where the
problems begin to arise. Does the creature think&mdash;that is to
say, does he arrange the processes of his life in the same manner as
men? This is a very important distinction. Certain creatures of the
universe use methods other than the human nerve-node system to
control their environments. We call the human system 'intelligence'&mdash;a
word which properly should be restricted to human activity. Other
creatures use different agencies, different systems, arriving
sometimes at similar ends. To bring home these generalities, I cannot
hope to merge my mind with the corresponding capacity in the First
Folk. The key will not fit the lock. At least, not altogether. Once
or twice when I watched the First Folk trading with men at Forest
Market, I felt occasional weak significances. This implies that the
First Folk mentality creates something similar to human telepathic
impulses. Nevertheless, there is no real sympathy between the two
races.</P>
<P>&quot;This is the first and the least difficulty.
If I were able to make complete telepathic contact&mdash;what then?
The creatures are different from us. They have no words for 'fear,'
'hate,' 'rage,' 'pain,' 'bravery,' 'cowardice.' One may deduce that
they do not feel these emotions. Undoubtedly they know other
sensations, possibly as meaningful. Whatever these may be, they are
unknown to me, and therefore I cannot either form or project symbols
for these sensations.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide stirred impatiently. &quot;In short,
you tell me that you cannot efficiently enter these creatures' minds;
and that if you could, you do not know what influences you could
plant there to do them harm.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Succinct,&quot; agreed Hein Huss.
&quot;Substantially accurate.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide rose to his feet. &quot;In that case
you must repair these deficiencies. You must learn to telepathize
with the First Folk; you must find what influences will harm them. As
quickly as possible.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss stared reproachfully at Lord Faide. &quot;But
I have gone to great lengths to explain the difficulties involved! To
hoodoo the First Folk is a monumental task! It would be necessary to
enter Wildwood, to live with the First Folk, to become one of them,
as my apprentice thought to become a tree. Even then an effective
hoodoo is improbable! The First Folk must be susceptible to
conviction! Otherwise there would be no bite to the hoodoo! I could
guarantee no success. I would predict failure. No other jinxman would
dare tell you this, no other would risk his <I>mana. </I>I dare
because I am Hein Huss, with life behind me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nevertheless we must attempt every weapon at
hand,&quot; said Lord Faide in a dry voice. &quot;I cannot risk my
knights, my kinsmen, my soldiers against these pallid half-creatures.
What a waste of good flesh and blood to be stuck by a poison insect!
You must go to Wildwood; you must learn how to hoodoo the First
Folk.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss heaved himself erect. His great round
face was stony; his eyes were like bits of water-worn glass. &quot;It
is likewise a waste to go on a fool's errand. I am no fool, and I
will not undertake a hoodoo which is futile from the beginning.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In that case,&quot; said Lord Faide, &quot;I
will find someone else.&quot; He went to the door, summoned a
servant. &quot;Bring Isak Comandore here.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss lowered his bulk into the chair. &quot;I
will remain during the interview, with your permission.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As you wish.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore appeared in the doorway, tall,
loosely articulated, head hanging forward. He darted a glance of
swift appraisal at Lord Faide, at Hein Huss, then stepped into the
room.</P>
<P>Lord Faide crisply explained his desires. &quot;Hein
Huss refuses to undertake the mission. Therefore I call on you.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore calculated. The pattern of his
thinking was clear: he possibly could gain much <I>mana; </I>there
was small risk of diminution, for had not Hein Huss already dodged
away from the project? Comandore nodded. &quot;Hein Huss has made
clear the difficulties; only a very clever and very lucky jinxman can
hope to succeed. But I accept the challenge, I will go.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good,&quot; said Hein Huss. &quot;I will go,
too.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Isak Comandore darted him a sudden hot glance. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I wish only to observe. To Isak Comandore
goes the responsibility and whatever credit may ensue.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Comandore presently.
&quot;I welcome your company. Tomorrow morning we leave. I go to
order our wagon.&quot;</P>
<P>Late in the evening Apprentice Sam Salazar came to
Hein Huss where he sat brooding in his workroom. &quot;What do you
wish?&quot; growled Huss.</P>
<P>&quot;I have a request to make of you, Head
Jinxman Huss.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Head Jinxman in name only,&quot; grumbled
Hein Huss. &quot;Isak Comandore is about to assume my position.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar blinked, laughed uncertainly. Hein
Huss fixed wintry-pale eyes on him. &quot;What do you wish?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have heard that you go on an expedition to
Wildwood, to study the First Folk.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;True, true. What then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Surely they will now attack all men?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss shrugged. &quot;At Forest Market they
trade with men. At Forest Market men have always entered the forest.
Perhaps there will be change, perhaps not.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I would go with you, if I may,&quot; said
Sam Salazar.</P>
<P>&quot;This is no mission for apprentices.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An apprentice must take every opportunity to
learn,&quot; said Sam Salazar. &quot;Also you will need extra hands
to set up tents, to load and unload cabinets, to cook, to fetch
water, and other such matters.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your argument is convincing,&quot; said Hein
Huss. &quot;We depart at dawn; be on hand.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>IX</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>As the sun lifted over the heath the jinxmen
departed Faide Keep. The high-wheeled wagon creaked north over the
moss, Hein Huss and Isak Comandore riding the front seat, Sam Salazar
with his legs hanging over the tail. The wagon rose and fell with the
dips and mounds of the moss, wheels wobbling, and presently passed
out of sight behind Skywatcher's Hill.</P>
<P>Five days later, an hour before sunset, the wagon
reappeared. As before, Hein Huss and Isak Comandore rode the front
seat, with Sam Salazar perched behind. They approached the keep, and
without giving so much as a sign or a nod, drove through the gate
into the courtyard.</P>
<P>Isak Comandore unfolded his long legs, stepped to
the ground like a spider; Hein Huss lowered himself with a grunt.
Both went to their quarters, while Sam Salazar led the wagon to the
jinxmen's warehouse.</P>
<P>Somewhat later Isak Comandore presented himself to
Lord Faide, who had been waiting in his trophy room, forced to a show
of indifference through considerations of position, dignity, and
protocol. Isak Comandore stood in the doorway, grinning like a fox.
Lord Faide eyed him with sour dislike, waiting for Comandore to
speak. Hein Huss might have stationed himself an entire day, eyes
placidly fixed on Lord Faide, awaiting the first word; Isak Comandore
lacked the absolute serenity. He came a step forward. &quot;I have
returned from Wildwood.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;With what results?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I believe that it is possible to hoodoo the
First Folk.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss spoke from behind Comandore. &quot;I
believe that such an undertaking, if feasible, would be useless,
irresponsible, and possibly dangerous.&quot; He lumbered forward.</P>
<P>Isak Comandore's eyes glowed hot red-brown; he
turned back to Lord Faide. &quot;You ordered me forth on a mission; I
will render a report.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Seat yourselves. I will listen.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore, nominal head of the expedition,
spoke. &quot;We rode along the river bank to Forest Market. Here was
no sign of disorder or of hostility. A hundred First Folk traded
timber, planks, posts, and poles for knife blades, iron wire, and
copper pots. When they returned to their barge we followed them
aboard, wagon, horses, and all. They showed no surprise<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Surprise,&quot; said Hein Huss heavily, &quot;is
an emotion of which they have no knowledge.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore glared briefly. &quot;We spoke to
the barge-tenders, explaining that we wished to visit the interior of
Wildwood. We asked if the First Folk would try to kill us to prevent
us from entering the forest. They professed indifference as to either
our well-being or our destruction. This was by no means a guarantee
of safe conduct; however, we accepted it as such, and remained aboard
the barge.&quot; He spoke on with occasional emendations from Hein
Huss.</P>
<P>They had proceeded up the river, into the forest,
the First Folk poling against the slow current. Presently they put
away the poles; nevertheless the barge moved as before. The mystified
jinxmen discussed the possibility of teleportation, or symboligical
force, and wondered if the First Folk had developed jinxing
techniques unknown to men. Sam Salazar, however, noticed that four
enormous water beetles, each twelve feet long with oil-black
carapaces and blunt heads, had risen from the river bed and pushed
the barge from behind&mdash;apparently without direction or command.
The First Folk stood at the bow, turning the nose of the barge this
way or that to follow the winding of the river. They ignored the
jinxmen and Sam Salazar as if they did not exist.</P>
<P>The beetles swam tirelessly; the barge moved for
four hours as fast as a man could walk. Occasionally, First Folk
peered from the forest shadows, but none showed interest or concern
in the barge's unusual cargo. By midafternoon the river widened,
broke into many channels and became a marsh; a few minutes later the
barge floated out into the open water of a small lake. Along the
shore, behind the first line of trees appeared a large settlement.
The jinxmen were interested and surprised. It had always been assumed
that the First Folk wandered at random through the forest, as they
had originally lived in the moss of the downs.</P>
<P>The barge grounded; the First Folk walked ashore,
the men followed with the horses and wagon. Their immediate
impressions were of swarming numbers, of slow but incessant activity,
and they were attacked by an overpoweringly evil smell.</P>
<P>Ignoring the stench, the men brought the wagon in
from the shore, paused to take stock of what they saw. The settlement
appeared to be a center of many diverse activities. The trees had
been stripped of lower branches, and supported blocks of hardened
foam three hundred feet long, fifty feet high, twenty feet thick,
with a space of a man's height intervening between the underside of
the foam and the ground. There were a dozen of these blocks,
apparently of cellular construction. Certain of the cells had broken
open and seethed with small white fishlike creatures&mdash;the First
Folk young.</P>
<P>Below the blocks masses of First Folk engaged in
various occupations, in the main unfamiliar to the jinxmen. Leaving
the wagon in the care of Sam Salazar, Hein Huss and Isak Comandore
moved forward among the First Folk, repelled by the stench and the
pressure of alien flesh, but drawn by curiosity. They were neither
heeded nor halted; they wandered everywhere about the settlement. One
area seemed to be an enormous zoo, divided into a number of sections.
The purpose of one of these sections&mdash;a kind of range two
hundred-feet long&mdash;was all too clear. At one end a human corpse
hung on a rope&mdash;a Faide casualty from the battle at the new
planting. Certain of the wasps flew straight at the corpse; just
before contact they were netted and removed. Others flew up and away
or veered toward the First Folk who stood along the side of the
range. These latter also were netted and killed at once.</P>
<P>The purpose of the business was clear enough.
Examining some of the other activity in this new light, the jinxmen
were able to interpret much that had hitherto puzzled them.</P>
<P>They saw beetles tall as dogs with heavy
saw-toothed pincers attacking objects resembling horses; pens of
insects even larger, long narrow, segmented, with dozens of heavy
legs and nightmare heads. All these creatures&mdash;wasps, beetles,
centipedes&mdash;in smaller and less formidable form were indigenous
to the forest; it was plain that the First Folk had been practicing
selective breeding for many years, perhaps centuries.</P>
<P>Not all the activity was warlike. Moths were
trained to gather nuts, worms to gnaw straight holes through timber;
in another section caterpillars chewed a yellow mash, molded it into
identical spheres. Much of the evil odor emanated from the zoo; the
jinxmen departed without reluctance, and returned to the wagon. Sam
Salazar pitched the tent and built a fire, while Hein Huss and Isak
Comandore discussed the settlement.</P>
<P>Night came; the blocks of foam glowed with
imprisoned light; the activity underneath proceeded without
cessation. The jinxmen retired to the tent and slept, while Sam
Salazar stood guard.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The following day Hein Huss was able to engage one
of the First Folk in conversation; it was the first attention of any
sort given to them.</P>
<P>The conversation was long; Hein Huss reported only
the gist of it to Lord Faide. (Isak Comandore turned away,
ostentatiously disassociating himself from the matter.)</P>
<P>Hein Huss first of all had inquired as to the
purpose of the sinister preparations: the wasps, beetles, centipedes,
and the like.</P>
<P>&quot;We intend to kill men,&quot; the creature
had reported ingenuously. &quot;We intend to return to the moss. This
has been our purpose ever since men appeared on the planet.&quot;</P>
<P>Huss had stated that such an ambition was
shortsighted, that there was ample room for both men and First Folk
on Pangborn. &quot;The First Folk,&quot; said Hein Huss, &quot;should
remove their traps and cease their efforts to surround the keeps with
forest.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; came the response, &quot;men are
intruders. They mar the beautiful moss. All will be killed.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore returned to the conversation. &quot;I
noticed here a significant fact. All the First Folk within sight had
ceased their work; all looked toward us, as if they, too,
participated in the discussion. I reached the highly important
conclusion that the First Folk are not complete individuals but
components of a larger unity, joined to a greater or less extent by a
telepathic phase not unlike our own.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss continued placidly, &quot;I remarked
that if we were attacked, many of the First Folk would perish. The
creature showed no concern, and in fact implied much of what Jinxman
Comandore had already induced: 'There are always more in the cells to
replace the elements which die. But if the community becomes sick,
all suffer. We have been forced into the forests, into a strange
existence. We must arm ourselves and drive away the men, and to this
end we have developed the methods of men to our own purposes!' &ldquo;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore spoke. &quot;Needless to say, the
creature referred to the ancient men, not ourselves.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In any event,&quot; said Lord Faide, &quot;they
leave no doubt as to their intentions. We should be fools not to
attack them at once, with every weapon at our disposal.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss continued imperturbably. &quot;The
creature went on at some length. 'We have learned the value of
irrationality.' 'Irrationality' of course was not his word or even
his meaning. He said something like 'a series of vaguely motivated
trials'&mdash;as close as I can translate. He said, 'We have learned
to change our environment. We use insects and trees and plants and
waterslugs. It is an enormous effort for us who would prefer a placid
life in the moss. But you men have forced this life on us, and now
you must suffer the consequences.' I pointed out once more that men
were not helpless, that many First Folk would die. The creature
seemed unworried. 'The community persists.' I asked a delicate
question, 'If your purpose is to kill men, why do you allow us here?'
He said, 'The entire community of men will be destroyed.' Apparently
they believe the human society to be similar to their own, and
therefore regard the killing of three wayfaring individuals as
pointless effort.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide laughed grimly. &quot;To destroy us
they must first win past Hellmouth, then penetrate Faide Keep. This
they are unable to do.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore resumed his report. &quot;At this
time I was already convinced that the problem was one of hoodooing
not an individual but an entire race. In theory this should be no
more difficult than hoodooing one. It requires no more effort to
speak to twenty than to one. With this end in view I ordered the
apprentice to collect substances associated with the creatures.
Skinflakes, foam, droppings, all other exudations obtainable. While
he did so, I tried to put myself in rapport with the creatures. It is
difficult, for their telepathy works across a different stratum from
ours. Nevertheless, to a certain extent I have succeeded.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then you can hoodoo the First Folk?&quot;
asked Lord Faide.</P>
<P>&quot;I vouchsafe nothing until I try. Certain
preparations must be made.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go then; make your preparations.&quot;</P>
<P>Comandore rose to his feet and with a sly side
glance for Hein Huss left the room. Huss waited, pinching his chin
with heavy fingers. Lord Faide looked at him coldly. &quot;You have
something to add?&quot;</P>
<P>Huss grunted, hoisted himself to his feet. &quot;I
wish that I did. But my thoughts are confused. Of the many futures,
all seem troubled and angry. Perhaps our best is not good enough.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide looked at Hein Huss with surprise; the
massive Head Jinxman had never before spoken in terms so pessimistic
and melancholy. &quot;Speak then; I will listen.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss said gruffly, &quot;If I knew any
certainties I would speak gladly. But I am merely beset by doubts. I
fear that we can no longer depend on logic and careful jinxmanship.
Our ancestors were miracle workers, magicians. They drove the First
Folk into the forest. To put us to flight in our turn the First Folk
have adopted the ancient methods: random trial and purposeless
empiricism. I am dubious. Perhaps we must turn our backs on sanity
and likewise return to the mysticism of our ancestors.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide shrugged. &quot;If Isak Comandore can
hoodoo the First Folk, such a retreat may be unnecessary.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The world changes,&quot; said Hein Huss. &quot;Of
so much I feel sure: the old days of craft and careful knowledge are
gone. The future is for men of cleverness, of imagination untroubled
by discipline; the unorthodox Sam Salazar may become more effective
than I. The world changes.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide smiled his sour dyspeptic smile. &quot;When
that day comes I will appoint Sam Salazar Head Jinxman and also name
him Lord Faide, and you and I will retire together to a hut on the
downs.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss made a heavy fateful gesture and
departed.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>X</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Two days later Lord Faide, coming upon Isak
Comandore, inquired as to his progress. Comandore took refuge in
generalities. After another two days Lord Faide inquired again and
this time insisted on particulars. Comandore grudgingly led the way
to his workroom, where a dozen cabalmen, spellbinders, and
apprentices worked around a large table, building a model of the
First Folk settlement in Wildwood.</P>
<P>&quot;Along the lakeshore,&quot; said Comandore,
&quot;I will range a great number of dolls, daubed with First Folk
essences. When this is complete I will work up a hoodoo and blight
the creatures.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good. Perform well.&quot; Lord Faide
departed the workroom, mounted to the topmost pinnacle of the keep,
to the cupola where the ancestral weapon Hellmouth was housed.
&quot;Jambart! Where are you?&quot;</P>
<P>Weapon-tender Jambart, short, blue-jowled,
red-nosed and big-bellied, appeared. &quot;My lord?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I come to inspect Hellmouth. Is it prepared
for instant use?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Prepared, my lord, and ready. Oiled,
greased, polished, scraped, burnished, tended&mdash;every part smooth
as an egg.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide made a scowling examination of
Hellmouth&mdash;a heavy cylinder six feet in diameter, twelve feet
long, studded with half-domes interconnected with tubes of polished
copper. Jambart undoubtedly had been diligent. No trace of dirt or
rust or corrosion showed; all was gleaming metal. The snout was
covered with a heavy plate of metal and tarred canvas; the ring upon
which the weapon swiveled was well greased.</P>
<P>Lord Faide surveyed the four horizons. To the
south was fertile Faide Valley; to the west open downs; to north and
east the menacing loom of Wildwood.</P>
<P>He turned back to Hellmouth and pretended to find
a smear of grease. Jambart boiled with expostulations and
protestations; Lord Faide uttered a grim warning, enjoining less
laxity, then descended to the workroom of Hein Huss. He found the
Head Jinxman reclining on a couch, staring at the ceiling. At a bench
stood Sam Salazar surrounded by bottles, flasks, and dishes.</P>
<P>Lord Faide stared balefully at the confusion.
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked the apprentice.</P>
<P>Sam Salazar looked up guiltily. &quot;Nothing in
particular, my lord.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you are idle, go then and assist Isak
Comandore.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am not idle, Lord Faide.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then what do you do?&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar gazed sulkily at the bench. &quot;I
don't know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then you are idle!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I am occupied. I pour various liquids on
this foam. It is First Folk foam. I wonder what will happen. Water
does not dissolve it, nor spirits. Heat chars and slowly burns it,
emitting a foul smoke.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide turned away with a sneer. &quot;You
amuse yourself as a child might. Go to Isak Comandore; he can find
use for you. How do you expect to become a jinxman, dabbling and
prattling like a baby among pretty rocks?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss gave a deep sound: a mingling of sigh,
snort, grunt, and clearing of the throat. &quot;He does no harm, and
Isak Comandore has hands enough. Salazar will never become a jinxman;
that has been clear a long time.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide shrugged. &quot;He is your apprentice,
and your responsibility. Well, then. What news from the keeps?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss, groaning and wheezing, swung his legs
over the edge of the couch. &quot;The lords share your concern, to
greater or less extent. Your close allies will readily place troops
at your disposal; the others likewise if pressure is brought to
bear.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide nodded in dour satisfaction. &quot;For
the moment there is no urgency. The First Folk hold to their forests.
Faide Keep of course is impregnable, although they might ravage the
valley. . . .&quot; he paused thoughtfully. &quot;Let Isak Comandore
cast his hoodoo. Then we will see.&quot;</P>
<P>From the direction of the bench came a hiss, a
small explosion, a whiff of acrid gas. Sam Salazar turned guiltily to
look at them, his eyebrows singed. Lord Faide gave a snort of disgust
and strode from the room.</P>
<P>&quot;What did you do?&quot; Hein Huss inquired in
a colorless voice.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</P>
<P>Now Hein Huss likewise snorted in disgust.
&quot;Ridiculous. If you wish to work miracles, you must remember
your procedures. Miracle working is not jinxmanship, with established
rules and guides. In matters so complex it is well that you take
notes, so that the miracles may be repeated.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar nodded in agreement and turned back to
the bench.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>XI</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Late during the day, news of new First Folk
truculence reached Faide Keep. On Honeymoss Hill, not far west of
Forest Market, a camp of shepherds had been visited by a wandering
group of First Folk, who began to kill the sheep with thorn-swords.
When the shepherds protested they, too, were attacked, and many were
killed. The remainder of the sheep were massacred.</P>
<P>The following day came other news: four children
swimming in Brastock River at Gilbert Ferry had been seized by
enormous water-beetles and cut into pieces. On the other side of
Wildwood, in the foothills immediately below Castle Cloud, peasants
had cleared several hillsides and planted them to vines. Early in the
morning they had discovered a horde of black disklike flukes
devouring the vines&mdash; leaves, branches, trunks, and roots. They
set about killing the flukes with spades and at once were stung to
death by wasps.</P>
<P>Adam McAdam reported the incidents to Lord Faide,
who went to Isak Comandore in a fury. &quot;How soon before you are
prepared?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am prepared now. But I must rest and
fortify myself. Tomorrow morning I work the hoodoo.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The sooner the better! The creatures have
left their forest; they are out killing men!&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore pulled his long chin. &quot;That
was to be expected; they told us as much.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide ignored the remark. &quot;Show me your
tableau.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore took him into his workroom. The
model was now complete, with the masses of simulated First Folk
properly daubed and sensitized, each tied with a small wad of foam.
Isak Comandore pointed to a pot of dark liquid. &quot;I will explain
the basis of the hoodoo. When I visited the camp I watched everywhere
for powerful symbols. Undoubtedly there were many at hand, but I
could not discern them. However, I remembered a circumstance from the
battle at the planting: when the creatures were attacked, threatened
with fire and about to die, they spewed foam of dull purple color.
Evidently this purple foam is associated with death. My hoodoo will
be based upon this symbol.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Rest well, then, so that you may hoodoo to
your best capacity.&quot;</P>
<P>The following morning Isak Comandore dressed in
long robes of black, and set a mask of the demon Nard on his head to
fortify himself. He entered his workroom, closed the door.</P>
<P>An hour passed, two hours. Lord Faide sat at
breakfast with his kin, stubbornly maintaining a pose of cynical
unconcern. At last he could contain himself no longer and went out
into the courtyard where Comandore's underlings stood fidgeting and
uneasy. &quot;Where is Hein Huss?&quot; demanded Lord Faide. &quot;Summon
him here.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss came stumping out of his quarters. Lord
Faide motioned to Comandore's workshop. &quot;What is happening? Is
he succeeding?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss looked toward the workshop. &quot;He is
casting a powerful hoodoo. I feel confusion, anger<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In Comandore, or in the First Folk?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am not in rapport. I think he has conveyed
a message to their minds. A very difficult task, as I explained to
you. In this preliminary aspect he has succeeded.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot; 'Preliminary'? What else remains?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The two most important elements of the
hoodoo: the susceptibility of the victim and the appropriateness of
the symbol.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide frowned. &quot;You do not seem
optimistic.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am uncertain. Isak Comandore may be right
in his assumption. If so, and if the First Folk are highly
susceptible, today marks a great victory, and Comandore will achieve
tremendous <I>mana</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P>Lord Faide stared at the door to the workshop.
&quot;What now?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss's eyes went blank with concentration.
&quot;Isak Comandore is near death. He can hoodoo no more today.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide turned, waved his arm to the cabalmen.
&quot;Enter the workroom! Assist your master!&quot;</P>
<P>The cabalmen raced to the door, flung it open.
Presently they emerged supporting the limp form of Isak Comandore,
his black robe spattered with purple foam. Lord Faide pressed close.
&quot;What did you achieve? Speak!&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore's eyes were half closed, his mouth
hung loose and wet. &quot;I spoke to the First Folk, to the whole
race. I sent the symbol into their minds&mdash;&quot; His head fell
limply sidewise.</P>
<P>Lord Faide moved back. &quot;Take him to his
quarters. Put him on his couch.&quot; He turned away, stood
indecisively, chewing at his drooping lower lip. &quot;Still we do
not know the measure of his success.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Hein Huss, &quot;but we do!&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide jerked around. &quot;What is this? What
do you say?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I saw into Comandore's mind. He used the
symbol of purple foam; with tremendous effort he drove it into their
minds. Then he learned that purple foam means not death&mdash; purple
foam means fear for the safety of the community, purple foam means
desperate rage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In any event,&quot; said Lord Faide after a
moment, &quot;there is no harm done. The First Folk can hardly become
more hostile.&quot;</P>
<P>Three hours later a scout rode furiously into the
courtyard, threw himself off his horse, ran to Lord Faide. &quot;The
First Folk have left the forest! A tremendous number! Thousands! They
are advancing on Faide Keep!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let them advance!&quot; said Lord Faide.
&quot;The more the better! Jambart, where are you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Here, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Prepare Hellmouth! Hold all in readiness!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hellmouth is always ready, sir!&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide struck him across the shoulders. &quot;Off
with you! Bernard!&quot;</P>
<P>The sergeant of the Faide troops came forward.
&quot;Ready, Lord Faide.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The First Folk attack. Armor your men
against wasps, feed them well. We will need all our strength.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide turned to Hein Huss. &quot;Send to the
keeps, to the manor houses, order our kinsmen to join us, with all
their troops and all their armor. Send to Bellgard Hall, to Boghoten,
Camber, and Candelwade. Haste, haste, it is only hours from
Wildwood.&quot;</P>
<P>Huss held up his hand. &quot;I have already done
so. The keeps are warned. They know your need.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the First Folk&mdash;can you feel their
minds?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide walked away. Hein Huss lumbered out the
main gate, walked around the keep, casting appraising glances up the
black walls of the squat towers, windowless and proof even against
the ancient miracle-weapons. High on top the great parasol roof
Jambart the weapon-tender worked in the cupola, polishing that which
already glistened, greasing surfaces already heavy with grease.</P>
<P>Hein Huss returned within. Lord Faide approached
him, mouth hard, eyes bright. &quot;What have you seen?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Only the keep, the walls, the towers, the
roof, and Hellmouth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what do you think?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think many things.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are noncommittal; you know more than you
say. It is best that you speak, because if Faide Keep falls to the
savages you die with the rest of us.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss's water-clear eyes met the brilliant
black gaze of Lord Faide. &quot;I know only what you know. The First
Folk attack. They have proved they are not stupid. They intend to
kill us. They are not jinxmen; they cannot afflict us or force us
out. They cannot break in the walls. To burrow under, they must dig
through solid rock. What are their plans? I do not know. Will they
succeed? Again, I do not know. But the day of the jinxman and his
orderly array of knowledge is past. I think that we must grope for
miracles, blindly and foolishly, like Salazar pouring liquids on
foam.&quot;</P>
<P>A troop of armored horsemen rode in through the
gates: warriors from nearby Bellgard Hall. And as the hours passed
contingents from other keeps came to Faide Keep, until the courtyard
was dense with troops and horses.</P>
<P>Two hours before sunset the First Folk were
sighted across the downs. They seemed a very large company, moving in
an undisciplined clot with a number of stragglers, forerunners and
wanderers out on the flanks.</P>
<P>The hotbloods from outside keeps came clamoring to
Lord Faide, urging a charge to cut down the First Folk; they found no
seconding voices among the veterans of the battle at the planting.
Lord Faide, however, was pleased to see the dense mass of First Folk.
&quot;Let them approach only a mile more&mdash;and Hellmouth will
take them! Jambart!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At your call, Lord Faide.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come, Hellmouth speaks!&quot; He strode away
with Jambart after. Up to the cupola they climbed.</P>
<P>&quot;Roll forth Hellmouth, direct it against the
savages!&quot;</P>
<P>Jambart leaped to the glistening array of wheels
and levers. He hesitated in perplexity, then tentatively twisted a
wheel. Hellmouth responded by twisting slowly around on its radial
track, to the groan and chatter of long-frozen bearings. Lord Faide's
brows lowered into a menacing line. &quot;I hear evidence of
neglect.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Neglect, my lord, never! Find one spot of
rust, a shadow of grime, you may have me whipped!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What of the sound?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is internal and invisible&mdash;none of
my responsibility.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide said nothing. Hellmouth now pointed
toward the great pale tide from Wildwood. Jambart twisted a second
wheel and Hellmouth thrust forth its heavy snout. Lord Faide, in a
voice harsh with anger, cried, &quot;The cover, fool!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An oversight, my lord, easily repaired.&quot;
Jambart crawled out along the top of Hellmouth, clinging to the
protuberances for dear life, with below only the long smooth sweep of
roof. With considerable difficulty he tore the covering loose, then
grunting and cursing, inched himself back, jerking with his knees,
rearing his buttocks.</P>
<P>The First Folk had slowed their pace a trifle, the
main body only a half-mile distant.</P>
<P>&quot;Now,&quot; said Lord Faide in high
excitement, &quot;before they disperse, we exterminate them!&quot; He
sighted through a telescopic tube, squinting through the dimness of
internal films and incrustations, signaled to Jambart for the final
adjustments. &quot;Now! Fire!&quot;</P>
<P>Jambart pulled the firing lever. Within the great
metal barrel came a sputter of clicking sounds. Hellmouth whined,
roared. Its snout glowed red, orange, white, and out poured a sudden
gout of blazing purple radiation&mdash;which almost instantly died.
Hellmouth's barrel quivered with heat, fumed, seethed, hissed. From
within came a faint pop. Then there was silence.</P>
<P>A hundred yards in front of the First Folk a patch
of moss burnt black where the bolt had struck. The aiming device was
inaccurate. Hellmouth's bolt had killed perhaps twenty of the First
Folk vanguard.</P>
<P>Lord Faide made feverish signals. &quot;Quick!
Raise the barrel. Now! Fire again!&quot;</P>
<P>Jambart pulled the firing arm, to no avail. He
tried again, with the same lack of success. &quot;Hellmouth evidently
is tired.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hellmouth is dead,&quot; cried Lord Faide.
&quot;You have failed me. Hellmouth is extinct.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no,&quot; protested Jambart. &quot;Hellmouth
rests! I nurse it as my own child! It is polished like glass!
Whenever a section wears off or breaks loose, I neatly remove the
fracture, and every trace of cracked glass.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide threw up his arms, shouted in vast,
inarticulate grief, ran below. &quot;Huss! Hein Huss!&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss presented himself. &quot;What is your
will?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hellmouth has given up its fire. Conjure me
more fire for Hellmouth, and quickly!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible!&quot; cried Lord Faide. &quot;That
is all I hear from you! Impossible, useless, impractical! You have
lost your ability. I will consult Isak Comandore.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Isak Comandore can put no more fire into
Hellmouth than can I.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What sophistry is this? He puts demons into
men, surely he can put fire into Hellmouth!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come, Lord Faide, you are overwrought. You
know the difference between jinxmanship and miracle working.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide motioned to a servant. &quot;Bring Isak
Comandore here to me!&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore, face haggard, skin waxy, limped
into the courtyard. Lord Faide waved preemptorily. &quot;I need your
skill. You must restore fire to Hellmouth.&quot;</P>
<P>Comandore darted a quick glance at Hein Huss, who
stood solid and cold. Comandore decided against dramatic promises
that could not be fulfilled. &quot;I cannot do this, my lord.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What! You tell me this, too?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Remark the difference, Lord Faide, between
man and metal. A man's normal state is something near madness; he is
at all times balanced on a knife-edge between hysteria and apathy.
His senses tell him far less of the world than he thinks they do. It
is a simple trick to deceive a man, to possess him with a demon, to
drive him out of his mind, to kill him. But metal is insensible;
metal reacts only as its shape and condition dictates, or by the
working of miracles.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then you must work miracles!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide drew a deep breath, collected himself.
He walked swiftly across the court. &quot;My armor, my horse. We
attack.&quot;</P>
<P>The column formed, Lord Faide at the head. He led
the knights through the portals, with armored footmen behind.</P>
<P>&quot;Beware the foam!&quot; called Lord Faide.
&quot;Attack, strike, cut, draw back. Keep your visors drawn against
the wasps! Each man must kill a hundred! Attack!&quot;</P>
<P>The troop rode forth against the horde of First
Folk, knights in the lead. The hooves of the horses pounded softly
over the thick moss; in the west the large pale sun hung close to the
horizon.</P>
<P>Two hundred yards from the First Folk the knights
touched the club-headed horses into a lope. They raised their swords,
and shouting, plunged forward, each man seeking to be first. The
clotted mass of First Folk separated: black beetles darted forth and
after them long segmented centipede creatures. They dashed among the
horses, mandibles clicking, snouts slashing. Horses screamed, reared,
fell over backwards; beetles cut open armored knights as a dog cracks
a bone. Lord Faide's horse threw him and ran away; he picked himself
up, hacked at a nearby beetle, lopped off its front leg. It darted
forward, he lopped off the leg opposite; the heavy head dipped, tore
up the moss. Lord Faide cut off the remaining legs, and it lay
helpless.</P>
<P>&quot;Retreat,&quot; he bellowed. &quot;Retreat!&quot;</P>
<P>The knights moved back, slashing and hacking at
beetles and centipedes, killing or disabling all which attacked.</P>
<P>&quot;Form into a double line, knights and men.
Advance slowly, supporting each other!&quot;</P>
<P>The men advanced. The First Folk dispersed to meet
them, armed with their thorn-swords and carrying pouches. Ten yards
from the men they reached into the pouches, brought dark balls which
they threw at the men. The balls broke and spattered on the armor.</P>
<P>&quot;Charge!&quot; bawled Lord Faide. The men
sprang forward into the mass of First Folk, cutting, slashing,
killing. &quot;Kill!&quot; called Lord Faide in exultation. &quot;Leave
not one alive!&quot;</P>
<P>A pang struck him, a sting inside his armor,
followed by another and another. Small things crawled inside the
metal, stinging, biting, crawling. He looked about: on all sides were
harassed expressions, faces working in anguish. Sword arms fell limp
as hands beat on the metal, futilely trying to scratch, rub. Two men
suddenly began to tear off their armor.</P>
<P>&quot;Retreat,&quot; cried Lord Faide. &quot;Back
to the keep!&quot;</P>
<P>The retreat was a rout, the soldiers shedding
articles of armor as they ran. After them came a flight of wasps&mdash;a
dozen or more, and half as many men cried out as the poison prongs
struck into their backs.</P>
<P>Inside the keep stormed the disorganized company,
casting aside the last of their armor, slapping their skin,
scratching, rubbing, crushing the ferocious red mites that infested
them.</P>
<P>&quot;Close the gates,&quot; roared Lord Faide.</P>
<P>The gates slid shut. Faide Keep was besieged.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>XII</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>During the night the First Folk surrounded the
keep, forming a ring fifty yards from the walls. All night there was
motion, ghostly shapes coming and going in the starlight.</P>
<P>Lord Faide watched from a parapet until midnight,
with Hein Huss at his side. Repeatedly, he asked, &quot;What of the
other keeps? Do they send further reinforcements?&quot; to which Hein
Huss each time gave the same reply: &quot;There is confusion and
doubt. The keep-lords are anxious to help but do not care to throw
themselves away. At this moment they consider and take stock of the
situation.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide at last left the parapet, signaling
Hein Huss to follow. He went to his trophy room, threw himself into a
chair, motioned Hein Huss to be seated. For a moment he fixed the
jinxman with a cool, calculating stare. Hein Huss bore the appraisal
without discomfort.</P>
<P>&quot;You are Head Jinxman,&quot; said Lord Faide
finally. &quot;For twenty years you have worked spells, cast hoodoos,
performed auguries&mdash;more effectively than any other jinxman of
Pangborn. But now I find you inept and listless. Why is this?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am neither inept nor listless. I am unable
to achieve beyond my abilities. I do not know how to work miracles.
For this you must consult my apprentice Sam Salazar, who does not
know either, but who earnestly tries every possibility and many
impossibilities.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You believe in this nonsense yourself!
Before my very eyes you become a mystic!&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss shrugged. &quot;There are limitations to
my knowledge. Miracles occur&mdash;that we know. The relics of our
ancestors lie everywhere. Their methods were supernatural, repellent
to our own mental processes&mdash;but think! Using these same methods
the First Folk threaten to destroy us. In the place of metal they use
living flesh&mdash;but the result is similar. The men of Pangborn, if
they assemble and accept casualties, can drive the First Folk back to
Wildwood&mdash;but for how long? A year? Ten years? The First Folk
plant new trees, dig more traps&mdash;and presently come forth again,
with more terrible weapons: flying beetles, large as a horse; wasps
strong enough to pierce armor, lizards to scale the walls of Faide
Keep.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide pulled at his chin. &quot;And the
jinxmen are helpless?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You saw for yourself. Isak Comandore
intruded enough into their consciousness to anger them, no more.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So then&mdash;what must we do?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss held out his hands. &quot;I do not know.
I am Hein Huss, jinxman. I watch Sam Salazar with fascination. He
learns nothing, but he is either too stupid or too intelligent to be
discouraged. If this is the way to work miracles, he will work them.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide rose to his feet. &quot;I am deathly
tired. I cannot think, I must sleep. Tomorrow we will know more.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss left the trophy room, returned to the
parapet. The ring of First Folk seemed closer to the walls, almost
within dart-range. Behind them and across the moors stretched a long
pale column of marching First Folk. A little back from the keep a
pile of white material began to grow, larger and larger as the night
proceeded.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Hours passed, the sky lightened; the sun rose in
the east. The First Folk tramped the downs like ants, bringing long
bars of hardened foam down from the north, dropping them into piles
around the keep, returning into the north once more.</P>
<P>Lord Faide came up on the parapet, haggard and
unshaven. &quot;What is this? What do they do?&quot;</P>
<P>Bernard the sergeant responded. &quot;They puzzle
us all, my lord.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hein Huss! What of the other keeps?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They have armed and mounted; they approach
cautiously.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can you communicate our urgency?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I can, and I have done so. I have only
accentuated their caution.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bah!&quot; cried Lord Faide in disgust.
&quot;Warriors they call themselves! Loyal and faithful allies!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They know of your bitter experience,&quot;
said Hein Huss. &quot;They ask themselves, reasonably enough, what
they can accomplish which you who are already here cannot do first.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide laughed sourly. &quot;I have no answer
for them. In the meantime we must protect ourselves against the
wasps. Armor is useless; they drive us mad with mites. . . .
Bernard!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Lord Faide.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have each of your men construct a frame
two-feet square, fixed with a short handle. To these frames should be
sewed a net of heavy mesh. When these frames are built we will sally
forth, two soldiers to guard one half-armored knight on foot.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the meantime,&quot; said Hein Huss, &quot;the
First Folk proceed with their plans.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide turned to watch. The First Folk came
close up under the walls carrying rods of hardened foam. &quot;Bernard!
Put your archers to work! Aim for the heads!&quot;</P>
<P>Along the walls bowmen cocked their weapons. Darts
spun down into the First Folk. A few were affected, turned and
staggered away; others plucked away the bolts without concern.
Another flight of bolts, a few more First Folk were disabled. The
others planted the rods in the moss, exuded foam in great gushes,
their back-flaps vigorously pumping air. Other First Folk brought
more rods, pushed them into the foam. Entirely around the keep, close
under the walls, extended the mound of foam. The ring of First Folk
now came close and all gushed foam; it bulked up swiftly. More rods
were brought, thrust into the foam, reinforcing and stiffening the
mass.</P>
<P>&quot;More darts!&quot; barked Lord Faide. &quot;Aim
for the heads! Bernard&mdash;your men, have they prepared the wasp
nets?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not yet, Lord Faide. The project requires
some little time.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide became silent. The foam, now ten feet
high, rapidly piled higher. Lord Faide turned to Hein Huss. &quot;What
do they hope to achieve?&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss shook his head. &quot;For the moment I
am uncertain.&quot;</P>
<P>The first layer of foam had hardened; on top of
this the First Folk spewed another layer, reinforcing again with the
rods, crisscrossing, horizontal and vertical. Fifteen minutes later,
when the second layer was hard the First Folk emplaced and mounted
rude ladders to raise a third layer. Surrounding the keep now was a
ring of foam thirty feet high and forty feet thick at the base.</P>
<P>&quot;Look,&quot; said Hein Huss. He pointed up.
The parasol roof overhanging the walls ended only thirty feet above
the foam. &quot;A few more layers and they will reach the roof.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So then?&quot; asked Lord Faide. &quot;The
roof is as strong as the walls.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And we will be sealed within.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide studied the foam in the light of this
new thought. Already the First Folk, climbing laboriously up ladders
along the outside face of their wall of foam, were preparing to lay
on a fourth layer. First&mdash;rods, stiff and dry, then great gushes
of white. Only twenty feet remained between roof and foam.</P>
<P>Lord Faide turned to the sergeant. &quot;Prepare
the men to sally forth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What of the wasp nets, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are they almost finished?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Another ten minutes, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Another ten minutes will see us smothering.
We must force a passage through the foam.&quot;</P>
<P>Ten minutes passed, and fifteen. The First Folk
created ramps behind their wall: first, dozens of the rods, then
foam, and on top, to distribute the weight, reed mats.</P>
<P>Bernard the sergeant reported to Lord Faide. &quot;We
are ready.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good.&quot; Lord Faide descended into the
courtyard. He faced the men, gave them their orders. &quot;Move
quickly, but stay together; we must not lose ourselves in the foam.
As we proceed, slash ahead and to the sides. The First Folk see
through the foam; they have the advantage of us. When we break
through, we use the wasp nets. Two foot soldiers must guard each
knight. Remember, quickly through the foam, that we do not smother.
Open the gates.&quot;</P>
<P>The gates slid back, the troops marched forth.
They faced an unbroken blank wall of foam. No enemy could be seen.</P>
<P>Lord Faide waved his sword. &quot;Into the foam.&quot;
He strode forward, pushed into the white mass, now crisp and brittle
and harder than he had bargained for. It resisted him; he cut and
hacked. His troops joined him, carving a way into the foam. First
Folk appeared above them, crawling carefully on the mats. Their back
flaps puffed, pumped; foam issued from their vents, falling in a
cascade over the troops.</P>
<P>Hein Huss sighed. He spoke to Apprentice Sam
Salazar. &quot;Now they must retreat, otherwise they smother. If they
fail to win through, we all smother.&quot;</P>
<P>Even as he spoke the foam, piling up swiftly, in
places reached the roof. Below, bellowing and cursing, Lord Faide
backed out from under, wiped his face clear. Once again, in
desperation, he charged forward, trying at a new spot.</P>
<P>The foam was friable and cut easily, but the
chunks detached still blocked the opening. And again down tumbled a
cascade of foam, covering the soldiers.</P>
<P>Lord Faide retreated, waved his men back into the
keep. At the same moment First Folk crawling on mats on the same
level as the parapet over the gate laid rods up from the foam to rest
against the projecting edge of the roof. They gushed foam; the view
of the sky was slowly blocked from the view of Hein Huss and Sam
Salazar.</P>
<P>&quot;In an hour, perhaps two, we will die,&quot;
said Hein Huss. &quot;They have now sealed us in. There are many men
here in the keep, arid all will now breathe deeply.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar said nervously, &quot;There is a
possibility we might be able to survive&mdash;or at least not
smother.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah?&quot; inquired Hein Huss with heavy
sarcasm. &quot;You plan to work a miracle?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If a miracle, the most trivial sort. I
observed that water has no effect on the foam, nor a number of other
liquids: milk, spirits, wine, or caustic. Vinegar, however, instantly
dissolves the foam.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Aha,&quot; said Hein Huss. &quot;We must
inform Lord Faide.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Better that you do so,&quot; said Sam
Salazar. &quot;He will pay me no heed.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>XIII</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Half an hour passed. Light filtered into Faide
Keep only as a dim gray gloom. Air tasted flat, damp, and heavy. Out
from the gates sallied the troops. Each carried a crock, a jug, a
skin, or a pan containing strong vinegar.</P>
<P>&quot;Quickly now,&quot; called Lord Faide, &quot;but
careful! Spare the vinegar, don't throw it wildly. In close formation
now&mdash;forward.&quot;</P>
<P>The soldiers approached the wall, threw ladles of
vinegar ahead. The foam crackled, melted.</P>
<P>&quot;Waste no vinegar,&quot; shouted Lord Faide.
&quot;Forward, quickly now; bring forward the vinegar!&quot;</P>
<P>Minutes later they burst out upon the downs. The
First Folk stared at them, blinking.</P>
<P>&quot;Charge,&quot; croaked Lord Faide, his throat
thick with fumes. &quot;Mind now, wasp nets! Two soldiers to each
knight! Charge, double-quick. Kill the white beasts.&quot;</P>
<P>The men dashed ahead. Wasp tubes were leveled.
&quot;Halt!&quot; yelled Lord Faide. &quot;Wasps!&quot;</P>
<P>The wasps came, wings rasping. Nets rose up; wasps
struck with a thud. Down went the nets; hard feet crushed the
insects. The beetles and the lizard-centipedes appeared, not so many
as of the last evening, for a great number had been killed. They
darted forward, and a score of men died, but the insects were soon
hacked into chunks of reeking brown flesh. Wasps flew, and some
struck home; the agonies of the dying men were unnerving. Presently
the wasps likewise decreased in number, and soon there were no more.</P>
<P>The men faced the First Folk, armed only with
thorn-swords and their foam, which now came purple with rage.</P>
<P>Lord Faide waved his sword; the men advanced and
began to kill the First Folk, by dozens, by hundreds.</P>
<P>Hein Huss came forth and approached Lord Faide.
&quot;Call a halt.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A halt? Why? Now we kill these bestial
things.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Far better not. Neither need kill the other.
Now is the time to show great wisdom.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They have besieged us, caught us in their
traps, stung us with their wasps! And you say halt?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They nourish a grudge sixteen hundred years
old. Best not to add another one.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide stared at Hein Huss. &quot;What do you
propose?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Peace between the two races, peace and
cooperation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well. No more traps, no more plantings,
no more breeding of deadly insects.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Call back your men. I will try.&quot; Lord
Faide cried out, &quot;Men, fall back, Disengage.&quot; Reluctantly
the troops drew back. Hein Huss approached the huddled mass of
purple-foaming First Folk. He waited a moment. They watched him
intently. He spoke in their language.</P>
<P>&quot;You have attacked Faide Keep; you have been
defeated. You planned well, but we have proved stronger. At this
moment we can kill you. Then we can go on to fire the forest,
starting a hundred blazes. Some of the fires you can control. Others
not. We can destroy Wildwood. Some First Folk may survive, to hide in
the thickets and breed new plans to kill men. This we do not want.
Lord Faide has agreed to peace, if you likewise agree. This means no
more death traps. Men will freely approach and pass through the
forests. In your turn you may freely come out on the moss. Neither
race shall molest the other. Which do you choose? Extinction&mdash;or
peace?&quot;</P>
<P>The purple foam no longer dribbled from the vents
of the First Folk. &quot;We choose peace.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There must be no more wasps, beetles. The
death traps must be disarmed and never replaced.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We agree. In our turn we must be allowed
freedom of the moss.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Agreed. Remove your dead and wounded, haul
away the foam rods.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss returned to Lord Faide. &quot;They have
chosen peace.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide nodded. &quot;Very well. It is for the
best.&quot; He called to his men. &quot;Sheathe your weapons. We have
won a great victory.&quot; He ruefully surveyed Faide Keep, swathed
in foam and invisible except for the parasol roof. &quot;A hundred
barrels of vinegar will not be enough.&quot;</P>
<P>Hein Huss looked off into the sky. &quot;Your
allies approach quickly. Their jinxmen have told them of your
victory.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide laughed his sour laugh. &quot;To my
allies will fall the task of removing the foam from Faide Keep.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3><I>XIV</I></H3>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In the hall of Faide Keep, during the victory
banquet, Lord Faide called jovially across to Hein Huss. &quot;Now,
Head Jinxman, we must deal with your apprentice, the idler and the
waster Sam Salazar.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He is here, Lord Faide. Rise, Sam Salazar,
take cognizance of the honor being done you.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar rose to his feet, bowed.</P>
<P>Lord Faide proffered him a cup. &quot;Drink, Sam
Salazar, enjoy yourself. I freely admit that your idiotic tinkerings
saved the lives of us all. Sam Salazar, we salute you, and thank you.
Now, I trust that you will put frivolity aside, apply yourself to
your work, and learn honest jinxmanship. When the time comes, I
promise that you shall find a lifetime of employment at Faide Keep.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Sam Salazar modestly.
&quot;However, I doubt if I will become a jinxman.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No? You have other plans?&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar stuttered, grew faintly pink in the
face, then straightened himself, and spoke as clearly and distinctly
as he could. &quot;I prefer to continue what you call my frivolity. I
hope I can persuade others to join me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Frivolity is always attractive,&quot; said
Lord Faide. &quot;No doubt you can find other idlers and wasters,
runaway farm boys, and the like.&quot;</P>
<P>Sam Salazar said staunchly, &quot;This frivolity
might become serious. Undoubtedly the ancients were barbarians. They
used symbols to control entities they were unable to understand. We
are methodical and rational; why can't we systematize and comprehend
the ancient miracles?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, why can't we?&quot; asked Lord Faide.
&quot;Does anyone have an answer?&quot;</P>
<P>No one responded, although Isak Comandore hissed
between his teeth and shook his head.</P>
<P>&quot;I personally may never be able to work
miracles; I suspect it is more complicated than it seems,&quot; said
Sam Salazar. &quot;However, I hope that you will arrange for a
workshop where I and others who might share my views can make a
beginning. In this matter I have the encouragement and the support of
Head Jinxman Hein Huss.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide lifted his goblet. &quot;Very well,
Apprentice Sam Salazar. Tonight I can refuse you nothing. You shall
have exactly what you wish, and good luck to you. Perhaps you will
produce a miracle during my lifetime.&quot;</P>
<P>Isak Comandore said huskily to Hein Huss, &quot;This
is a sad event! It signalizes intellectual anarchy, the degradation
of jinxmanship, the prostitution of logic. Novelty has a way of
attracting youth; already I see apprentices and spellbinders
whispering in excitement. The jinxmen of the future will be sorry
affairs. How will they go about demon-possession? With a cog, a gear,
and a push-button. How will they cast a hoodoo? They will find it
easier to strike their victim with an axe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Times change,&quot; said Hein Huss. &quot;There
is now the one rule of Faide on Pangborn, and the keeps no longer
need to employ us. Perhaps I will join Sam Salazar in his workshop.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You depict a depressing future,&quot; said
Isak Comandore with a sniff of disgust.</P>
<P>&quot;There are many futures, some of which are
undoubtedly depressing.&quot;</P>
<P>Lord Faide raised his glass. &quot;To the best of
your many futures, Hein Huss. Who knows? Sam Salazar may conjure a
spaceship to lead us back to home-planet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who knows?&quot; said Hein Huss. He raised
his goblet. &quot;To the best of the futures!&quot;</P>
