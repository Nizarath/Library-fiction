<p class=QuotedFlush>Jack Vance Is deservedly popular for his colorful
far-future adventure stories such as <i>The Dying Earth</i>, <i>The Dragon
Masters</i>, and <i>The Last Castle</i>. An aspect of his work that is
frequently overlooked, however, is the wry wit with which he exposes mankind's
self-indulgent (and self-defeating) follies as they are enlarged by scientific
sophistication, leading to the effete, degenerate societies of his future
worlds. Here he presents a deft picture of a world where travel to alternate
timestreams is commonplace—and of the misuse to which this ability can be put.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>From <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and Reflections, </span>by
Alan Robertson:</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Often I hear myself declared humanity's preeminent
benefactor, though the jocular occasionally raise a claim in favor of the
original serpent. After all circumspection I really cannot dispute the
judgment. My place in history is secure; my name will persist as if it were
printed indelibly across the sky. All of which I find absurd but
understandable. For I have given wealth beyond calculation. I have expunged
deprivation, famine, overpopulation, territorial constriction: All the
first-order causes of contention have vanished. My gifts go freely and carry
with them my personal joy, but as a reasonable man (and for lack of other
restrictive agency), I feel that I cannot relinquish all control, for when has
the human animal ever been celebrated for abnegation and self-discipline?</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>We now enter an era of plenty and a time of new concerns.
The old evils are gone: we must resolutely prohibit a flamboyant and perhaps
unnatural set of new vices.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>The three girls gulped down breakfast, assembled their
homework, and departed noisily for school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth poured coffee for herself and Gilbert. He thought
she seemed pensive and moody. Presently she said, &quot;It's so beautiful here…We're
very lucky, Gilbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I never forget it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth sipped her coffee and mused a moment, following
some vagrant train of thought. She said, &quot;I never liked growing up. I
always felt strange—different from the other girls. I really don't know
why.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's no mystery. Everyone for a fact is
different.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Perhaps…But Uncle Peter and Aunt Emma always acted as
if I were more different than usual. I remember a hundred little signals. And
yet I was such an ordinary little girl…Do you remember when you were
little?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Not very well.&quot; Gilbert Duray looked out the
window he himself had glazed, across green slopes and down to the placid water
his daughters had named the Silver River. The Sounding Sea was thirty miles
south; behind the house stood the first trees of the Robber Woods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray considered his past. &quot;Bob owned a ranch in
Arizona during the 1870's: one of his fads. The Apaches killed my father and
mother. Bob took me to the ranch, and then when I was three he brought me to
Alan's house in San Francisco, and that's where I was brought up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth sighed. &quot;Alan must have been wonderful. Uncle
Peter was so grim. Aunt Emma never told me anything. Literally, not anything!
They never cared the slightest bit for me, one way or the other…I wonder why
Bob brought the subject up—about the Indians and your mother and father being
scalped and all…He's such a strange man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Was Bob here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He looked in a few minutes yesterday to remind us of
his Rumfuddle. I told him I didn't want to leave the girls. He said to bring
them along.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hah!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I told him I didn't want to go to his damn Rumfuddle
with or without the girls. In the first place, I don't want to see Uncle Peter,
who's sure to be there…&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and
Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>I insisted then and I insist now that our dear old Mother
Earth, so soiled and toil-worn, never be neglected. Since I pay the piper (in a
manner of speaking), I call the tune, and to my secret amusement I am heeded
most briskly the world around, in the manner of bellboys, jumping to the
command of an irascible old gentleman who is known to be a good tipper. No one
dares to defy me. My whims become actualities; my plans progress.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Paris, Vienna, San Francisco, St. Petersburg, Venice,
London, Dublin, surely will persist, gradually to become idealized essences of
their former selves, as wine in due course becomes the soul of the grape. What
of the old vitality? The shouts and curses, the neighborhood quarrels, the
raucous music, the vulgarity? Gone, all gone! (But easy of reference at any of
the cognates.) Old Earth is to be a gentle, kindly world, rich in treasures and
artifacts, a world of old places—old inns, old roads, old forests, old
palaces—where folk come to wander and dream, to experience the best of the past
without suffering the worst.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Material abundance can now be taken for granted: Our
resources are infinite. Metal, timber, soil, rock, water, air: free for
anyone's taking. A single commodity remains in finite supply: human toil.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Gilbert Duray, the informally adopted grandson of Alan
Robertson, worked on the Urban Removal Program. Six hours a day, four days a
week, he guided a trashing machine across deserted Cuperinto, destroying tract
houses, service stations, and supermarkets. Knobs and toggles controlled a
steel hammer at the end of a hundred-foot boom; with a twitch of the finger,
Duray toppled power poles, exploded picture windows, smashed siding and stucco,
pulverized concrete. A disposal rig crawled fifty feet behind. The detritus was
clawed upon a conveyor-belt, carried to a twenty-foot orifice, and dumped with
a rush and a rumble into the Apathetic Ocean. Aluminum siding, asphalt shingles,
corrugated fiber-glass, TV's and barbecues, Swedish Modern furniture,
Book-of-the-Month selections, concrete patio-tiles, finally the sidewalk and
street itself: all to the bottom of the Apathetic Ocean. Only the trees
remained, a strange eclectic forest stretching as far as the eye could reach:
liquidambar and Scotch pine; Chinese pistachio, Atlas cedar, and ginkgo; white
birch and Norway maple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At one o'clock Howard Wirtz emerged from the caboose, as
they called the small locker room at the rear of the machine. Wirtz had
homesteaded a Miocene world; Duray, with a wife and three children, had
preferred the milder environment of a contemporary semicognate: the popular
Type A world on which man had never evolved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray gave Wirtz the work schedule. &quot;More or less like
yesterday—straight out Persimmon to Walden, then right a block and back.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wirtz, a dour and laconic man, acknowledged the information
with a jerk of the head. On his Miocene world he lived alone, in a houseboat on
a mountain lake. He harvested wild rice, mushrooms, and berries; he shot geese,
ground-fowl, deer, young bison, and had once informed Duray that after his five
year work-time, he might just retire to his lake and never appear on Earth
again, except maybe to buy clothes and ammunition. &quot;Nothing here I want,
nothing at all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray had given a derisive snort. &quot;And what will you do
with all your time?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hunt, fish, eat, and sleep, maybe sit on the front
deck.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nothing else?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I just might learn to fiddle. Nearest neighbor is
fifteen million years away.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You can't be too careful, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray descended to the ground and looked over his day's
work: a quarter-mile swath of desolation. Duray, who allowed his subconscious
few extravagances, nevertheless felt a twinge for the old times, which, for all
their disadvantages, at least had been lively. Voices, bicycle bells, the
barking of dogs, the slam of doors, still echoed along Persimmon Avenue. The
former inhabitants presumably preferred their new homes. The self-sufficient
had taken private worlds; the more gregarious lived in communities on worlds of
every description: as early as the Carboniferous, as current as the Type A. A
few had even returned to the now-uncrowded cities. An exciting era to live in:
a time of flux. Duray, thirty-four years old, remembered no other way of life;
the old existence, as exemplified by Persimmon Avenue, seemed antique, cramped,
constricted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had a word with the operator of the trashing machine;
returning to the caboose, Duray paused to look through the orifice across the
Apathetic Ocean. A squall hung black above the southern horizon, toward which a
trail of broken lumber drifted, ultimately to wash up on some unknown
pre-Cambrian shore. There never would be an inspector sailing forth to protest;
the world knew no life other than mollusks and algae, and all the trash of
Earth would never fill its submarine gorges. Duray tossed a rock through the
gap and watched the alien water splash up and subside. Then he turned away and
entered the caboose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Along the back wall were four doors. The second from the
left was marked &quot;<b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>G. DURAY.</span></b>&quot;
He unlocked the door, pulled it open, and stopped short, staring in
astonishment at the blank back wall. He lifted the transparent plastic flap
that functioned as an air-seal and brought out the collapsed metal ring that
had been the flange surrounding his passway. The inner surface was bare metal;
looking through, he saw only the interior of the caboose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A long minute passed. Duray stood staring at the useless
ribbon as if hypnotized, trying to grasp the implications of the situation. To
his knowledge no passway had ever failed, unless it had been purposefully
closed. Who would play him such a spiteful trick? Certainly not Elizabeth. She
detested practical jokes and if anything, like Duray himself, was perhaps a
trifle too intense and literal-minded. He jumped down from the caboose and
strode off across Cupertino Forest: a sturdy, heavy-shouldered man of about
average stature. His features were rough and uncompromising; his brown hair was
cut crisply short; his eyes glowed golden-brown and exerted an arresting force.
Straight, heavy eyebrows crossed his long, thin nose like the bar of a T; his
mouth, compressed against some strong inner urgency, formed a lower horizontal
bar. All in all, not a man to be trifled with, or so it would seem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He trudged through the haunted grove, preoccupied by the
strange and inconvenient event that had befallen him. What had happened to the
passway? Unless Elizabeth had invited friends out to Home, as they called their
world, she was alone, with the three girls at school…Duray came out upon
Stevens Creek Road. A farmer's pickup truck halted at his signal and took him
into San Jose, now little more than a country town.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the transit center he dropped a coin in the turnstile and
entered the lobby. Four portals designated <b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;LOCAL,&quot;
&quot;CALIFORNIA,&quot; &quot;NORTH AMERICA,&quot;</span></b> and <b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;WORLD&quot;</span></b> opened in the walls, each
portal leading to a hub on Utilis.*</p>

<div style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;
margin-left:.5in;margin-right:1.0in'>

<p class=Footnote style='margin-top:.25in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25in;
margin-left:0in'>* Utilis: a world cognate to Paleocene Earth, where, by Alan
Robertson's decree, all the industries, institutions, warehouses, tanks, dumps,
and commercial offices of old Earth were now located. The name, Utilis, so it
had been remarked, accurately captured the flavor of Alan Robertson's pedantic,
quaint, and idealistic personality.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray passed into the &quot;California&quot; hub, found the
&quot;Oakland&quot; portal, returned to the Oakland Transit Center on Earth,
passed back through the &quot;Local&quot; portal to the &quot;Oakland&quot; hub
on Utilis, and returned to Earth through the &quot;Montclair West&quot; portal
to a depot only a quarter mile from Thornhill School,* to which Duray walked.</p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-right:1.0in'>

<p class=Footnote style='margin-top:.25in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25in;
margin-left:0in'>*Alan Roberson had proposed another specialized world, to be
known as Tutelar, where the children of all the settled worlds should receive
their education in a vast array of pedagogical facilities, To his hurt
surprise, he encountered a storm of wrathful opposition from parents. His
scheme was termed mechanistic, vast, dehumanizing, repulsive. What better world
for schooling than old Earth itself? Here was the source of all tradition; let
Earth become Tutelar! So insisted the parents, and Alan Robertson had no choice
but to agree.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the office Duray identified himself to the clerk and
requested the presence of his daughter Dolly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clerk sent forth a messenger who, after an interval,
returned alone. &quot;Dolly Duray isn't at school.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray was surprised; Dolly had been in good health and had
set off to school as usual. He said, &quot;Either Joan or Ellen will do as
well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The messenger again went forth and again returned.
&quot;Neither one is in their classrooms, Mr. Duray. All three of your children
are absent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I can't understand it,&quot; said Duray, now fretful.
&quot;All three set off to school this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Let me ask Miss Haig. I've just come on duty.&quot;
The clerk spoke into a telephone, listened, then turned back to Duray.
&quot;The girls went home at ten o'clock. Mrs. Duray called for them and took
them back through the passway.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Did she give any reason whatever?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Miss Haig says No; Mrs. Duray just told her she needed
the girls at home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray stifled a sigh of baffled irritation. &quot;Could you
take me to their locker? I'll use their passway to get home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's contrary to school regulations, Mr. Duray.
You'll understand, I'm sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I can identify myself quite definitely,&quot; said
Duray. &quot;Mr. Carr knows me well. As a matter of fact, my passway collapsed,
and I came here to get home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why don't you speak to Mr. Carr?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'd like to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray was conducted into the principal's office, where he
explained his predicament. Mr. Carr expressed sympathy and made no difficulty
about taking Duray to the children's passway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They went to a hall at the back of the school and found the
locker numbered 382. &quot;Here we are,&quot; said Carr. &quot;I'm afraid that
you'll find it a tight fit.&quot; He unlocked the metal door with his master
key and threw it open. Duray looked inside and saw only the black metal at the
back of the locker. The passway, like his own, had been closed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray drew back and for a moment could find no words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carr spoke in a voice of polite amazement. &quot;How very
perplexing! I don't believe I've ever seen anything like it before! Surely the
girls wouldn't play such a silly prank!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They know better than to touch the passway,&quot;
Duray said gruffly. &quot;Are you sure that this is the right locker?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carr indicated the card on the outside of the locker, where
three names had been typed:  <b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>DOROTHY DURAY,
JOAN DURAY, ELLEN DURAY</span></b>. &quot;No mistake,&quot; said Carr,
&quot;and I'm afraid that I can't help you any further. Are you in common
residency?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's our private homestead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carr nodded with lips judiciously pursed, to suggest that
insistence upon so much privacy seemed eccentric. He gave a deprecatory little
chuckle. &quot;I suppose if you isolate yourself to such an extent, you more or
less must expect a series of emergencies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;To the contrary,&quot; Duray said crisply. &quot;Our
life is uneventful, because there's no one to bother us. We love the wild
animals, the quiet, the fresh air. We wouldn't have it any differently.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carr smiled a dry smile. &quot;Mr. Robertson has certainly
altered the lives of us all. I understand that he is your grandfather?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I was raised in his household. I'm his nephew's foster
son. The blood relationship isn't all that close.&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and
Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>I early became interested in magnetic fluxes and their
control. After taking my degree, I worked exclusively in this field, studying
all varieties of magnetic envelopes and developing controls over their
formation. For many years my horizons were thus limited, and I lived a placid
existence.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Two contemporary developments forced me down from my
&quot;ivory castle.&quot; First: the fearful overcrowding of the planet and the
prospect of worse to come. Cancer already was an affliction of the past; heart
diseases were under control; I feared that in another ten years immortality
might be a practical reality for many of us, with a consequent augmentation of
population pressure.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Secondly, the theoretical work done upon &quot;black
holes&quot; and &quot;white holes&quot; suggested that matter compacted in a
&quot;black hole&quot; broke through a barrier to spew forth from a &quot;white
hole&quot; in another universe. I calculated pressures and considered the
self-focusing magnetic sheaths, cones, and whorls with which I was
experimenting. Through their innate properties these entities constricted
themselves to apexes of a cross section indistinguishable from a geometric
point. What if two or more cones (I asked myself) could be arranged in
contraposition to produce an equilibrium? In this condition charged particles
must be accelerated to near light-speed and at the mutual focus constricted and
inpinged together. The pressures thus created, though of small scale, would be
far in excess of those characteristic of the &quot;black holes&quot;; to
unknown effect.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>I can now report that the mathematics of the multiple focus
are a most improbable thicket, and the useful service I enforced upon what I
must call a set of absurd contradictions is one of my secrets. I know that
thousands of scientists, at home and abroad, are attempting to duplicate my
work; they are welcome to the effort. None will succeed. Why do I speak so
positively? This is my other secret.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Duray marched back to the Montclair West depot in a state
of angry puzzlement. There were four passways to Home, of which two were
closed. The third was located in his San Francisco locker: the &quot;front
door,&quot; so to speak. The last and the original orifice was cased, filed,
and indexed in Alan Robertson's vault.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray tried to deal with the problem in rational terms. The
girls would never tamper with the passways. As for Elizabeth, no more than the
girls would she consider such an act. At least Duray could imagine no reason
that would so urge or impel her. Elizabeth, like himself a foster child, was a
beautiful, passionate woman, tall, dark-haired, with lustrous dark eyes and a
wide mouth that tended to curve in an endearingly crooked grin. She was also
responsible, loyal, careful, industrious; she loved her family and Riverview
Manor. The theory of erotic intrigue seemed to Duray as incredible as the fact
of the closed passways. Though, for a fact, Elizabeth was prone to wayward and
incomprehensible moods. Suppose Elizabeth had received a visitor who for some
sane or insane purpose had forced her to close the passway?…Duray shook his
head in frustration, like a harassed bull. The matter no doubt had some simple
cause. Or on the other hand, Duray reflected, the cause might be complex and
intricate. The thought, by some obscure connection, brought before him the
image of his nominal foster father, Alan Robertson's nephew, Bob Robertson.
Duray gave his head a nod of gloomy asseveration, as if to confirm a fact he
long ago should have suspected. He went to the phone booth and called Bob
Robertson's apartment in San Francisco. The screen glowed white and an instant
later displayed Bob Robertson's alert, clean, and handsome face. &quot;Good
afternoon, Gil. Glad you called; I've been anxious to get in touch with
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray became warier than ever. &quot;How so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nothing serious, or so I hope. I dropped by your
locker to leave off some books that I promised Elizabeth, and I noticed through
the glass that your passway is closed. Collapsed. Useless.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Strange,&quot; said Duray. &quot;Very strange indeed.
I can't understand it. Can you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No…not really.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray thought he detected a subtlety of intonation. His eyes
narrowed in concentration. &quot;The passway at my rig was closed. The passway
at the girls' school was closed. Now you tell me that the downtown passway is
closed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob Robertson grinned. &quot;That's a pretty broad hint, I
would say. Did you and Elizabeth have a row?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob Robertson rubbed his long aristocratic chin. &quot;A
mystery. There's probably some very ordinary explanation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Or some very extraordinary explanation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;True. Nowadays a person can't rule out anything. By
the way, tomorrow night is the Rumfuddle, and I expect both you and Elizabeth
to be on hand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;As I recall,&quot; said Duray, &quot;I've already
declined the invitation.&quot; The Rumfuddlers were a group of Bob's cronies.
Duray suspected that their activities were not altogether wholesome.
&quot;Excuse me; I've got to find an open passway, or Elizabeth and the kids
are marooned.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Try Alan,&quot; said Bob. &quot;He'll have the
original in his vault.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray gave a curt nod. &quot;I don't like to bother him, but
that's my last hope.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Let me know what happens,&quot; said Bob Robertson. &quot;And
if you're at loose ends, don't forget the Rumfuddle tomorrow night. I mentioned
the matter to Elizabeth, and she said she'd be sure to attend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Indeed. And when did you consult Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;A day or so ago. Don't look so damnably gothic, my
boy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm wondering if there's a connection between your
invitation and the closed passways. I happen to know that Elizabeth doesn't
care for your parties.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob Robertson laughed with easy good grace. &quot;Reflect a
moment. Two events occur. I invite you and wife Elizabeth to the Rumfuddle.
This is event one. Your passways close up, which is event two. By a feat of
structured absurdity you equate the two and blame me. Now is that fair?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You call it 'structured absurdity,' &quot; said Duray.
&quot;I call it instinct.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob Robertson laughed again. &quot;You'll have to do better
than that. Consult Alan, and if for some reason he can't help you, come to the
Rumfuddle. We'll rack our brains and either solve your problem or come up with
new and better ones.&quot; He gave a cheery nod, and before Duray could roar an
angry expostulation, the screen faded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray stood glowering at the screen, convinced that Bob
Robertson knew much more about the closed passways than he admitted. Duray went
to sit on a bench…If Elizabeth had closed him away from Home, her reasons must
have been compelling indeed. But unless she intended to isolate herself
permanently from Earth, she would leave at least one passway ajar, and this
must be the master orifice in Alan Robertson's vault.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray rose to his feet, somewhat heavily, and stood a
moment, head bent and shoulders hunched. He gave a surly grunt and returned to
the phone booth, where he called a number known to not more than a dozen
persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The screen glowed white while the person at the other end of
the line scrutinized his face…The screen cleared, revealing a round pale face
from which pale-blue eyes stared forth with a passionless intensity.
&quot;Hello, Ernest,&quot; said Duray. &quot;Is Alan busy at the moment?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't think he's doing anything particular—except
resting.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ernest gave the last two words a meaningful emphasis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I've got some problems,&quot; said Duray. &quot;What's
the best way to get in touch with him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You'd better come up here. The code is changed. It's
MHF now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'll be there in a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in the &quot;California&quot; hub on Utilis, Duray went
into a side chamber lined with private lockers, numbered and variously marked
with 'symbols, names, colored flags, or not marked at all. Duray went to Locker
122, and ignoring the keyhole, set the code lock to the letters MHF. The door
opened; Duray stepped into the locker and through the passway to the High
Sierra headquarters of Alan Robertson.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and
Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>If one basic axiom controls the cosmos, it must be this:</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush><span class=ItalicCharacter><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In
a situation of infinity every possible condition occurs, not once, but an
infinite number of times.</span></span></p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>There is no mathematical nor logical limit to the number
of dimensions. Our perceptions assure us of three only, but many indications
suggest otherwise: parapsychic occurrences of a hundred varieties, the
&quot;white holes,&quot; the seemingly finite state of our own universe, which
by corollary, asserts the existence of others.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Hence, when I stepped behind the lead slab and first
touched the button, I felt confident of success; failure would have surprised
me!</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>But (and here lay my misgivings) what sort of success
might I achieve?</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Suppose I opened a hole into the interplanetary vacuum?</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>The chances of this were very good indeed; I surrounded
the machine in a strong membrane to prevent the air of Earth from rushing off
into the void.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Suppose I discovered a condition totally beyond
imagination?</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>My imagination yielded no safeguards.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>I proceeded to press the button.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Duray stepped out into a grotto under damp granite walls.
Sunlight poured into the opening from a dark-blue sky. This was Alan
Robertson's link to the outside world; like many other persons, he disliked a
passway opening directly into his home. A path led fifty yards across bare
granite mountainside to the lodge. To the west spread a great vista of
diminishing ridges, valleys, and hazy blue air; to the east rose a pair of
granite crags, with snow caught in the saddle between. Alan Robertson's lodge
was built just below the timberline, beside a small lake fringed with tall dark
firs. The lodge was built of rounded granite stones, with a wooden porch across
the front; at each end rose a massive chimney.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray had visited the lodge on many occasions; as a boy he
had scaled both of the crags behind the house, to look wonderingly off across
the stillness, which on old Earth had a poignant breathing quality different
from the uninhabited solitudes of worlds such as Home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ernest came to the door: a middle-aged man with an ingenuous
face, small white hands, and soft, damp, mouse-colored hair. Ernest disliked
the lodge, the wilderness, and solitude in general; he nevertheless would have
suffered tortures before relinquishing his post as subaltern to Alan Robertson.
Ernest and Duray were almost antipodal in outlook. Ernest thought Duray
brusque, indelicate, a trifle coarse, and probably not disinclined to violence
as an argumentative adjunct. Duray considered Ernest, when he thought of him at
all, as the kind of man who takes two bites out of a cherry. Ernest had never
married; he showed no interest in women, and Duray, as a boy, had often fretted
at Ernest's overcautious restrictions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In particular Ernest resented Duray's free and easy access
to Alan Robertson. The power to restrict or admit those countless persons who
demanded Alan Robertson's attention was Ernest's most cherished perquisite, and
Duray denied him the use of it by simply ignoring Ernest and all his
regulations. Ernest had never complained to Alan Robertson for fear of
discovering that Duray's influence exceeded his own. A wary truce existed
between the two, each conceding the other his privileges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ernest performed a polite greeting and admitted Duray into
the lodge. Duray looked around the interior, which had not changed during his
lifetime: varnished plank floors with red, black, and white Navaho rugs,
massive pine furniture with leather cushions, a few shelves of books, a
half-dozen pewter mugs on the mantle over the big fireplace—a room almost
ostentatiously bare of souvenirs and mementos. Duray turned back to Ernest:
&quot;Whereabouts is Alan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;On his boat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;With guests?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; said Ernest, with a faint sniff of
disapproval. &quot;He's alone, quite alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;How long has he been gone?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He just went through an hour ago. I doubt if he's left
the dock yet. What is your problem, if I may ask?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The passways to my world are closed. All three.
There's only one left, in the vault.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ernest arched his flexible eyebrows. &quot;Who closed
them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't know. Elizabeth and the girls are alone, so
far as I know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Extraordinary,&quot; said Ernest in a flat metallic
voice. &quot;Well, then, come along.&quot; He led the way down a hall to a back
room. With his hand on the knob, Ernest paused and looked back over his
shoulder. &quot;Did you mention the matter to anyone? Robert, for instance?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Duray curtly, &quot;I did. Why do you
ask?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ernest hesitated a fraction of a second. &quot;No particular
reason. Robert occasionally has a somewhat misplaced sense of humor, he and his
Rumfuddlers.&quot; He spoke the word with a hiss of distaste.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray said nothing of his own suspicions. Ernest opened the
door; they entered a large room illuminated by a skylight. The only furnishing
was a rug on the varnished floor. Into each wall opened four doors. Ernest went
to one of these doors, pulled it open, and made a resigned gesture.
&quot;You'll probably find Alan at the dock.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray looked into the interior of a rude hut with palm-frond
walls, resting on a platform of poles. Through the doorway he saw a path
leading under sunlit green foliage toward a strip of white beach. Surf sparkled
below a layer of dark-blue ocean and a glimpse of the sky. Duray hesitated,
rendered wary by the events of the morning. Anyone and everyone was suspect,
even Ernest, who now gave a quiet sniff of contemptuous amusement. Through the
foliage Duray glimpsed a spread of sail; he stepped through the passway.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and
Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Man is a creature whose evolutionary environment has been
the open air. His nerves, muscles, and senses have developed across three
million years in intimate contiguity with natural earth, crude stone, live wood,
wind, and rain. Now this creature is suddenly—on the geologic scale,
instantaneously—shifted to an unnatural environment of metal and glass, plastic
and plywood, to which his psychic substrata lack all compatibility. The wonder
is not that we have so much mental instability but so little. Add to this the
weird noises, electrical pleasures, bizarre colors, synthetic foods, abstract
entertainments! We should congratulate ourselves on our durability.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>I bring this matter up because with my little device—so
simple, so easy, so flexible—I have vastly augmented the load upon our poor
primeval brain, and for a fact many persons find the instant transition from
one locale to another unsettling, and even actively unpleasant.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Duray stood on the porch of the cabin, under a vivid green
canopy of sunlit foliage. The air was soft and warm and smelled of moist
vegetation. He stood listening. The mutter of the surf came to his ears and
from a far distance a single bird-call.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Duray stepped down to the ground and followed the path
under tall palm trees to a river-bank. A few yards downstream, beside a rough
pier of poles and planks, floated a white and blue ketch, sails hoisted and
distended to a gentle breeze. On the deck stood Alan Robertson, on the point of
casting off the mooring lines. Duray hailed him; Alan Robertson turned in
surprise and vexation, which vanished when he recognized Duray. &quot;Hello,
Gil, glad you're here! For a moment I thought it might be someone to bother me.
Jump aboard; you're just in time for a sail.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray somberly joined Alan Robertson on the boat. &quot;I'm
afraid I am here to bother you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh?&quot; Alan Robertson raised his eyebrows in
instant solicitude. He was a man of no great height, thin, nervously active.
Wisps of rumpled white hair fell over his forehead; mild blue eyes inspected
Duray with concern, all thought of sailing forgotten. &quot;What in the world
has happened?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I wish I knew. If it were something I could handle
myself, I wouldn't bother you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't worry about me; there's all the time in the
world for sailing. Now tell me what's happened.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I can't get through to Home. All the passways are
closed off. Why and how I have no idea. Elizabeth and the girls are out there
alone; at least I think they're out there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson rubbed his chin. &quot;What an odd business!
I can certainly understand your agitation…You think Elizabeth closed the
passways?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's unreasonable—but there's no one else.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson turned Duray a shrewd, kindly glance. &quot;No
little family upsets? Nothing to cause her despair and anguish?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Absolutely nothing. I've tried to reason things out,
but I draw blank. I thought that maybe someone—a man—had gone through to visit
her and decided to take over—but if this were the case, why did she come to the
school for the girls? That possibility is out. A secret love affair? Possible
but so damn unlikely. Since she wants to keep me off the planet, her only
motive could be to protect me or herself or the girls from danger of some sort.
Again this means that another person is concerned in the matter. Who? How? Why?
I spoke to Bob. He claims to know nothing about the situation, but he wants me
to come to his damned Rumfuddle, and he hints very strongly that Elizabeth will
be on hand. I can't prove a thing against Bob, but I suspect him. He's always
had a taste for odd jokes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson gave a lugubrious nod. &quot;I won't deny
that.&quot; He sat down in the cockpit and stared off across the water.
&quot;Bob has a complicated sense of humor, but he'd hardly close you away from
your world…I hardly think that your family is in actual danger, but of course
we can't take chances. The possibility exists that Bob is not responsible, that
something uglier is afoot.&quot; He jumped to his feet. &quot;Our obvious first
step is to use the master orifice in the vault.&quot; He looked a shade
regretfully toward the ocean. &quot;My little sail can wait…A lovely world
this: not fully cognate with Earth—a cousin, so to speak. The fauna and flora
are roughly contemporary except for man. The hominids have never
developed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two men returned up the path, Alan Robertson chatting
lightheartedly: &quot;Thousands and thousands of worlds I've visited, and
looked into even more, but do you know I've never hit upon a good system of
classification? There are exact cognates—of course we're never sure exactly <span
class=ItalicCharacter>how </span>exact they are. These cases are relatively
simple, but then the problems begin…Bah! I don't think about such things
anymore. I know that when I keep all the nominates at zero, the cognates appear.
Over intellectualizing is the bane of this and every other era. Show me a man
who deals only with abstraction, and I'll show you the dead, futile end of
evolution.&quot; Alan Robertson chuckled. &quot;If I could control the machine
tightly enough to produce real cognates, our troubles would be over…Much
confusion, of course. I might step through into the cognate world immediately
as a true cognate Alan Robertson steps through into our world, with net effect
of zero. An amazing business, really; I never tire of it…&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They returned to the transit room of the mountain lodge.
Ernest appeared almost instantly. Duray suspected he had been watching through
the passway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson said briskly, &quot;We'll be busy for an hour
or two, Ernest. Gilbert is having difficulties, and we've got to set things
straight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ernest nodded somewhat grudgingly, or so it seemed to Duray.
&quot;The progress report on the Ohio Plan has arrived. Nothing particularly
urgent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you, Ernest, I'll see to it later. Come along,
Gilbert; let's get to the bottom of this affair.&quot; They went to door No. 1
and passed through to the Utilis hub. Alan Robertson led the way to a small
green door with a three-dial coded lock, which he opened with a flourish.
&quot;Very well, in we go.&quot; He carefully locked the door behind them, and
they walked the length of a short hall. &quot;A shame that I must be so
cautious,&quot; said Alan Robertson. &quot;You'd be astonished at the
outrageous requests otherwise sensible people make of me. I sometimes become
exasperated…Well, it's understandable, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of the hall Alan Robertson worked the locking
dials of a red door. &quot;This way, Gilbert; you've been through before.&quot;
They stepped through a passway into a hall that opened into a circular concrete
chamber fifty feet in diameter, located, so Duray knew, deep under the Mad Dog
Mountains of the Mojave Desert. Eight halls extended away into the rock; each
hall communicated with twelve aisles. The center of the chamber was occupied by
a circular desk twenty feet in diameter; here six clerks in white smocks worked
at computers and collating machines. In accordance with their instructions they
gave Alan Robertson neither recognition nor greeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson went up to the desk, at which signal the
chief clerk, a solemn young man bald as an egg, came forward. &quot;Good
afternoon, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good afternoon, Harry. Find me the index for 'Gilbert
Duray,' on my personal list.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clerk bowed smartly. He went to an instrument and ran
his fingers over a bank of keys; the instrument ejected a card that Harry
handed to Alan Robertson. &quot;There you are, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson showed the card to Duray, who saw the code:
&quot;4:8:10/6:13:29.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's your world,&quot; said Alan Robertson.
&quot;We'll soon learn how the land lies. This way, to Radiant four.&quot; He
led the way down the hall, turned into the aisle numbered &quot;8,&quot; and
proceeded to Stack 10. &quot;Shelf six,&quot; said Alan Robertson. He checked
the card. &quot;Drawer thirteen…here we are.&quot; He drew forth the drawer and
ran his fingers along the tabs. &quot;Item twenty-nine. This should be
Home.&quot; He brought forth a metal frame four inches square and held it up to
his eyes. He frowned in disbelief. &quot;We don't have anything here
either.&quot; He turned to Duray a glance of dismay. &quot;This is a serious
situation!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's no more than I expected,&quot; said Duray
tonelessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;All this demands some careful thought.&quot; Alan
Robertson clicked his tongue in vexation. &quot;Tst, tst, tst.&quot; He
examined the identification plaque at the top of the frame. &quot;Four: eight:
ten/six: thirteen: twenty-nine,&quot; he read. &quot;There seems to be no
question of error.&quot; He squinted carefully at the numbers, hesitated, then
slowly replaced the frame. On second thought he took the frame forth once more.
&quot;Come along, Gilbert,&quot; said Alan Robertson. &quot;We'll have a cup of
coffee and think this matter out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two returned to the central chamber, where Alan
Robertson gave the empty frame into the custody of Harry the clerk. &quot;Check
the records, if you please,&quot; said Alan Robertson. &quot;I want to know how
many passways were pinched off the master.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Harry manipulated the buttons of his computer. &quot;Three
only, Mr. Robertson.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Three passways and the master—four in all?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's right, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you, Harry.&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and
Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>I recognized the possibility of many cruel abuses, but the
good so outweighed the bad that I thrust aside all thought of secrecy and
exclusivity. I consider myself not Alan Robertson but, like Prometheus, an
archetype of Man, and my discovery must serve all men.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>But caution, caution, caution!</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>I sorted out my ideas. I myself coveted the amplitude of a
private, personal world; such a yearning was not ignoble, I decided. Why should
not everyone have the same if he so desired, since the supply was limitless?
Think of it! The wealth and beauty of an entire world: mountains and plains,
forests and flowers, ocean cliffs and crashing seas, winds and clouds—all
beyond value, yet worth no more than a few seconds of effort and a few watts of
energy.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>I became troubled by a new idea. Would everyone desert old
Earth and leave it a vile junk-heap? I found the concepts intolerable…I
exchange access to a world for three to six years of remedial toil, depending
upon occupancy.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>A lounge overlooked the central chamber. Alan Robertson
gestured Duray to a seat and drew two mugs of coffee from a dispenser. Settling
in a chair, he turned his eyes up to the ceiling. &quot;We must collect our
thoughts. The circumstances are somewhat unusual; still, I have lived with
unusual circumstances for almost fifty years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So then: the situation. We have verified that there
are only four passways to Home. These four passways are closed, though we must
accept Bob's word in regard to your downtown locker. If this is truly the case,
if Elizabeth and the girls are still on Home, you will never see them again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bob is mixed up in this business. I could swear to
nothing, but—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson held up his hand. &quot;I will talk to Bob;
this is the obvious first step.&quot; He rose to his feet and went to the
telephone in the corner of the lounge. Duray joined him. Alan spoke into the
screen. &quot;Get me Robert Robertson's apartment in San Francisco.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The screen glowed white. Bob's voice came from the speaker.
&quot;Sorry, I'm not at home. I have gone out to my world Fancy, and I cannot
be reached. Call back in a week, unless your business is urgent, in which case
call back in a month.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mmph,&quot; said Alan Robertson, returning to his
seat. &quot;Bob is sometimes a trifle too flippant. A man with an
under-extended intellect…&quot; He drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair.
&quot;Tomorrow night is his party? What does he call it? A Rumfuddle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Some such nonsense. Why does he want me? I'm a dull
dog; I'd rather be home building a fence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Perhaps you had better plan to attend the party.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That means, submit to his extortion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Do you want to see your wife and family again?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Naturally. But whatever he has in mind won't be for my
benefit, or Elizabeth's.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're probably right there. I've heard one or two
unsavory tales regarding the Rumfuddlers…The fact remains that the passways are
closed. All four of them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray's voice became harsh. &quot;Can't you open a new
orifice for us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson gave his head a sad shake. &quot;I can tune
the machine very finely. I can code accurately for the 'Home' class of worlds
and as closely as necessary approximate a particular world-state. But at each
setting, no matter how fine the tuning, we encounter an infinite number of
worlds. In practice, inaccuracies in the machine, backlash, the gross size of
electrons, the very difference between one electron and another, make it
difficult to tune with absolute precision. So even if we tuned exactly to the
'Home' class, the probability of opening into your particular Home is one in an
infinite number: in short, negligible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray stared off across the chamber. &quot;Is it possible
that a space once entered might tend to open more easily a second time?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson smiled. &quot;As to that, I can't say. I
suspect not, but I really know so little. I see no reason why it should be
so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;If we can open into a world precisely cognate, I can
at least learn why the passways are closed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson sat up in his chair. &quot;Here is a valid
point. Perhaps we can accomplish something in this regard.&quot; He glanced
humorously sidewise at Duray. &quot;On the other hand—consider this situation.
We create access into a 'Home' almost exactly cognate to your own—so nearly
identical that the difference is not readily apparent. You find there an
Elizabeth, a Dolly, a Joan, and an Ellen indistinguishable from your own, and a
Gilbert marooned on Earth. You might even convince yourself that this is your
very own Home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'd know the difference,&quot; said Duray shortly, but
Alan Robertson seemed not to hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Think of it! An infinite number of Homes isolated from
Earth, an infinite number of Elizabeths, Dollys, Joans, and Ellens marooned, an
infinite number of Gilbert Durays trying to regain access…The sum effect might
be a wholesale reshuffling of families, with everyone more or less good-natured
about the situation. I wonder if this could be Bob's idea of a joke to share
with his Rumfuddlers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray looked sharply at Alan Robertson, wondering whether
the man were serious. &quot;It doesn't sound funny, and I wouldn't be very
good-natured.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Of course not,&quot; said Alan Robertson hastily.
&quot;An idle thought—in rather poor taste, I'm afraid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;In any event, Bob hinted that Elizabeth would be at
his damned Rumfuddle. If that's the case, she must have closed the passways
from this side.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;A possibility,&quot; Alan Robertson conceded,
&quot;but unreasonable. Why should she seal you away from Home?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't know, but I'd like to find out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson slapped his hands down upon his thin shanks
and jumped to his feet, only to pause once more. &quot;You're sure you want to
look into these cognates? You might see things you wouldn't like.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So long as I know the truth, I don't care whether I
like it or not.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So be it.&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>The machine occupied a room behind the balcony. Alan
Robertson surveyed the device with pride and affection. &quot;This is the
fourth model, and probably optimum; at least I don't see any place for
significant improvement. I use a hundred and sixty-seven rods converging upon
the center of the reactor sphere. Each rod produces a quotum of energy and is
susceptible to several types of adjustment to cope with the very large number
of possible states. The number of particles to pack the universe full is on the
order of ten raised to the power of sixty; the possible permutations of these
particles would number two raised to the power of ten raised to the power of
sixty. The universe, of course, is built of many different particles, which
makes the final number of possible, or let us say, thinkable states a number
like two raised to the power of ten raised to the power of sixty, all times <span
class=ItalicCharacter>x, </span>where <span class=ItalicCharacter>x </span>is
the number of particles under consideration. A large, unmanageable number,
which we need not consider, because the conditions we deal with—the possible
variations of planet Earth—are far fewer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Still a very large number,&quot; said Duray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Indeed yes. But again the sheer unmanageable bulk is
cut away by a self-normalizing property of the machine. In what I call floating
neutral the machine reaches the closest cycles—which is to say, that infinite
class of perfect cognates. In practice, because of infinitesimal inaccuracies,
'floating neutral' reaches cognates more or less imperfect, perhaps by no more
than the shape of a single grain of sand. Still, 'floating neutral' provides a
natural base, and by adjusting the controls, we reach cycles at an ever greater
departure from base. In practice I search out a good cycle and strike a large
number of passways, as many as a hundred thousand. So now to our
business.&quot; He went to a console at the side. &quot;Your code number, what
was it now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray brought forth the card and read the numbers:
&quot;Four: eight:ten/six:thirteen:twenty-nine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Very good. I give the code to the computer, which
searches the files and automatically adjusts the machine. Now then, step over
here; the process releases dangerous radiation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two stood behind lead slabs. Alan Robertson touched a
button; watching through a periscope, Duray saw a spark of purple light and
heard a small groaning, rasping sound seeming to come from the air itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson stepped forth and walked to the machine. In
the delivery tray rested an extensible ring. He picked up the ring and looked
through the hole. &quot;This seems to be right.&quot; He handed the ring to
Duray. &quot;Do you see anything you recognize?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray put the ring to his eye. &quot;That's Home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Very good. Do you want me to come with you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray considered. &quot;The time is now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes. This is a time-neutral setting.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I think I'll go alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson nodded. &quot;Whatever you like. Return as
soon as you can, so I'll know you're safe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray frowned at him sidewise. &quot;Why shouldn't I be
safe? No one is there but my family.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Not <span class=ItalicCharacter>your </span>family.
The family of a cognate Gilbert Duray. The family may not be absolutely
identical. The cognate Duray may not be identical. You can't be sure exactly
what you will find—so be careful.&quot;</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and
Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>When I think of my machine and my little forays in and out
of infinity, an idea keeps recurring to me which is so rather terrible that I
close it out of my mind, and I will not even mention it here.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Duray stepped out upon the soil of Home and stood
appraising the familiar landscape. A vast meadow drenched in sunlight rolled
down to wide Silver River. Above the opposite shore rose a line of low bluffs,
with copses of trees in the hollows. To the left, the landscape seemed to
extend indefinitely and at last become indistinct in the blue haze of distance.
To the right, the Robber Woods ended a quarter mile from where Duray stood. On
a flat beside the forest, on the bank of a small stream, stood a house of stone
and timber: a sight that seemed to Duray the most beautiful he had ever seen.
Polished glass windows sparkled in the sunlight; banks of geraniums glowed
green and red. From the chimney rose a wisp of smoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The air smelled cool and sweet but seemed—so Duray
imagined—to carry a strange tang, different—so he imagined—from the
meadow-scent of his own Home. Duray started forward, then halted. The world was
his own, yet not his own. If he had been conscious of the fact, would he have
recognized the strangeness? Nearby rose an outcrop of weathered gray
field-rock: a rounded mossy pad on which he had sat only two days before,
contemplating the building of a dock. He walked over and looked down at the stone.
Here he had sat; here were the impressions of his heels in the soil; here was
the pattern of moss from which he had absently scratched a fragment. Duray bent
close. The moss was whole. The man who had sat here, the cognate Duray, had not
scratched at the moss. So then: The world was perceptibly different from his
own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray was relieved and yet vaguely disturbed. If the world
had been the exact simulacrum of his own, he might have been subjected to
unmanageable emotions—which still might be the case. He walked toward the
house, along the path that led down to the river. He stepped up to the porch.
On a deck chair was a book: <span class=ItalicCharacter>Down There: A Study in
Satanism, </span>by J. K. Huysmans. Elizabeth's tastes were eclectic. Duray had
not previously seen the book; was it perhaps that Bob Robertson had put through
the parcel delivery?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray went into the house. Elizabeth stood across the room.
She had evidently watched him coming up the path. She said nothing; her face
showed no expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray halted, somewhat at a loss as to how to address this
familiar-strange woman. &quot;Good afternoon,&quot; he said at last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth allowed a wisp of a smile to show. &quot;Hello,
Gilbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least, thought Duray, on cognate worlds the same language
was spoken. He studied Elizabeth. Lacking prior knowledge, would he have
perceived her to be someone different from his own Elizabeth? Both were
beautiful women: tall and slender, with curling black shoulder-length hair,
worn without artifice. Their skins were pale, with a dusky undertone; their
mouths were wide, passionate, stubborn. Duray knew his Elizabeth to be a woman
of inexplicable moods, and this Elizabeth was doubtless no different—yet
somehow a difference existed that Duray could not define, deriving perhaps from
the strangeness of her atoms, the stuff of a different universe. He wondered if
she sensed the same difference in him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He asked, &quot;Did you close off the passways?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth nodded, without change of expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I thought it the best thing to do,&quot; said
Elizabeth in a soft voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's no answer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I suppose not. How did you get here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Alan made an opening.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth raised her eyebrows. &quot;I thought that was
impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;True. This is a different world to my own. Another
Gilbert Duray built this house. I'm not your husband.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth's mouth dropped in astonishment. She swayed back a
step and put her hand up to her neck: a mannerism Duray could not recall in his
own Elizabeth. The sense of strangeness came ever more strongly upon him. He
felt an intruder. Elizabeth was watching him with a wide-eyed fascination. She
said in a hurried mutter: &quot;I wish you'd leave; go back to your own world;
do!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;If you've closed off all the passways, you'll be
isolated,&quot; growled Duray. &quot;Marooned, probably forever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Whatever I do,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;it's not
your affair.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It is my affair, if only for the sake of the girls. I
won't allow them to live and die alone out here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The girls aren't here,&quot; said Elizabeth in a flat
voice. &quot;They are where neither you nor any other Gilbert Duray will find
them. So now go back to your own world, and leave me in whatever peace my soul
allows me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray stood glowering at the fiercely beautiful woman. He
had never heard his own Elizabeth speak so wildly. He wondered if on his own
world another Gilbert Duray similarly confronted his own Elizabeth, and as he
analyzed his feelings toward this woman before him, he felt a throb of
annoyance. A curious situation. He said in a quiet voice, &quot;Very well. You
and my own Elizabeth have decided to isolate yourselves. I can't imagine your
reasons.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth gave a wild laugh. &quot;They're real
enough.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They may be real now, but ten years from now or forty
years from now they may seem unreal. I can't give you access to your own Earth,
but if you wish, you can use the passway to the Earth from which I've just
come, and you need never see me again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth turned away and went to look out over the valley.
Duray spoke to her back. &quot;We've never had secrets between us, you and I—or
I mean, Elizabeth and I. Why now? Are you in love with some other man?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth gave a snort of sardonic amusement.
&quot;Certainly not…I'm disgusted with the entire human race.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Which presumably includes me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It does indeed, and myself as well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And you won't tell me why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth, still looking out the window, wordlessly shook
her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Duray in a cold voice.
&quot;Will you tell me where you've sent the girls? They're mine as much as
yours, remember.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;These particular girls aren't yours at all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That may be, but the effect is the same.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth said tonelessly: &quot;If you want to find your own
particular girls, you'd better find your own particular Elizabeth and ask her.
I can only speak for myself…To tell you the truth, I don't like being part of a
composite person, and I don't intend to act like one. I'm just me. You're you,
a stranger, whom I've never seen before in my life. So I wish you'd
leave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray strode from the house, out into the sunlight. He
looked once around the wide landscape, than gave his head a surly shake and
marched off along the path.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>The past is exposed for our scrutiny; we can wander the
epochs like lords through a garden, serene in our purview. We argue with the
noble sages, refuting their laborious concepts, should we be so unkind.
Remember (at least) two things. First: The more distant from now, the less
precise our conjunctures, the less our ability to strike to any given instant.
We can break in upon yesterday at a stipulated second; during the Eocene, plus
or minus ten years is the limit of our accuracy; as for the Cretaceous or
earlier, an impingement with three hundred years of a given date can be
considered satisfactory. Secondly: The past we broach is never our own past but
at best the past of a cognate world, so that any illumination cast upon
historical problems is questionable and perhaps deceptive. We cannot plumb the
future; the process involves a negative flow of energy, which is inherently
impractical. An instrument constructed of antimatter has been jocularly
recommended but would yield no benefit to us. The future, thankfully, remains
forever shrouded.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&quot;Aha, you're back!&quot; exclaimed Alan Robertson.
&quot;What did you learn?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray described the encounter with Elizabeth. &quot;She
makes no excuse for what she's done; she shows hostility which doesn't seem
real, especially since I can't imagine a reason for it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson had no comment to make.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The woman isn't my wife, but their motivations must be
the same. I can't think of one sensible explanation for conduct so strange, let
alone two.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Elizabeth seemed normal this morning?&quot; asked Alan
Robertson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I noticed nothing unusual.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson went to the control panel of his machine. He
looked over his shoulder at Duray. &quot;What time do you leave for work?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;About nine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson set one dial and turned two others until a
ball of green light balanced, wavering, precisely halfway along a glass tube.
He signaled Duray behind the lead slab and touched the button. From the center
of the machine came the impact of 167 colliding nodules of force and the groan
of rending dimensional fabric.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson brought forth the new passway. &quot;The time
is morning. You'll have to decide for yourself how to handle the situation. You
can try to watch without being seen; you can say that you have paper work to
catch up on, that Elizabeth should ignore you and go about her normal routine,
while you unobtrusively see what happens.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray frowned. &quot;Presumably for each of these worlds
there is a Gilbert Duray who finds himself in my fix. Suppose each tries to
slip inconspicuously into someone else's world to learn what is happening.
Suppose each Elizabeth catches him in the act and furiously accuses the man she
believes to be her husband of spying on her—this in itself might be the source
of Elizabeth's anger.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well, be as discreet as you can. Presumably you'll be
several hours, so I'll go back to the boat and putter about. Locker five in my
private hub yonder; I'll leave the door open.&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Once again Duray stood on the hillside above the river,
with the rambling stone house built by still another Gilbert Duray two hundred
yards along the slope. From the height of the sun, Duray judged local time to
be about nine o'clock—somewhat earlier than necessary. From the chimney of the
stone house rose a wisp of smoke; Elizabeth had built a fire in the kitchen
fireplace. Duray stood reflecting. This morning in his own house Elizabeth had
built no fire. She had been on the point of striking a match and then had
decided that the morning was already warm. Duray waited ten minutes, to make
sure that the local Gilbert Duray had departed, then set forth toward the
house. He paused by the big flat stone to inspect the pattern of moss. The
crevice seemed narrower than he remembered, and the moss was dry and
discolored. Duray took a deep breath. The air, rich with the odor of grasses
and herbs, again seemed to carry an odd, unfamiliar scent. Duray proceeded
slowly to the house, uncertain whether, after all, he was engaged in a sensible
course of action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He approached the house. The front door was open. Elizabeth
came to look out at him in surprise. &quot;That was a quick day's work!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray said lamely, &quot;The rig is down for repairs. I
thought I'd catch up on some paper work. You go ahead with whatever you were
doing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth looked at him curiously. &quot;I wasn't doing
anything in particular.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He followed Elizabeth into the house. She wore soft black
slacks and an old gray jacket; Duray tried to remember what his own Elizabeth
had worn, but the garments had been so familiar that he could summon no recollection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth poured coffee into a pair of stoneware mugs, and
Duray took a seat at the kitchen table, trying to decide how this Elizabeth
differed from his own—if she did. This Elizabeth seemed more subdued and
meditative; her mouth might have been a trifle softer. &quot;Why are you
looking at me so strangely?&quot; she asked suddenly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray laughed. &quot;I was merely thinking what a beautiful
girl you are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth came to sit in his lap and kissed him, and Duray's
blood began to flow warm. He restrained himself; this was not his wife; he
wanted no complications. And if he yielded to temptations of the moment, might
not another Gilbert Duray visiting his own Elizabeth do the same…He scowled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth, finding no surge of ardor, went to sit in the
chair opposite. For a moment she sipped her coffee in silence. Then she said,
&quot;Just as soon as you left, Bob called through.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh?&quot; Duray was at once attentive. &quot;What did
he want?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That foolish party of his—the Rubble-menders or some
such thing. He wants us to come.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I've already told him No three times.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I told him No again. His parties are always so
peculiar. He said he wanted us to come for a very special reason, but he
wouldn't tell me the reason. I told him, 'Thank you but no.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray looked around the room. &quot;Did he leave any
books?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No. Why should he leave me books?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I wish I knew.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Gilbert,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;you're acting
rather oddly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, I suppose I am.&quot; For a fact Duray's mind was
whirling. Suppose now he went to the school passway, brought the girls home
from school, then closed off all the passways, so that once again he had an
Elizabeth and three daughters, more or less his own; then the conditions he had
encountered would be satisfied. And another Gilbert Duray, now happily
destroying the tract houses of Cupertino, would find himself bereft…Duray
recalled the hostile conduct of the previous Elizabeth. The passways in that
particular world had certainly not been closed off by an intruding Duray…A
startling possibility came to his mind. Suppose a Duray had come to the house,
and succumbing to temptation, had closed off all passways except that one
communicating with his own world; suppose then that Elizabeth, discovering the
imposture, had killed him…The theory had a grim plausibility and totally
extinguished whatever inclination Duray might have had for making the world his
home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth said, &quot;Gilbert, why are you looking at me
with that strange expression?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray managed a feeble grin. &quot;I guess I'm just in a bad
mood this morning. Don't mind me. I'll go make out my report.&quot; He went
into the wide cool living room, at once familiar and strange, and brought out
the work-records of the other Gilbert Duray…He studied the handwriting: like
his own, firm and decisive, but in some indefinable way, different—perhaps a
trifle more harsh and angular. The three Elizabeths were not identical, nor
were the Gilbert Durays.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An hour passed. Elizabeth occupied herself in the kitchen;
Duray pretended to write a report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A bell sounded. &quot;Somebody at the passway,&quot; said
Elizabeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray said, &quot;I'll take care of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He went to the passage room, stepped through the passway,
looked through the peephole—into the large, bland, sun-tanned face of Bob
Robertson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray opened the door. For a moment he and Bob Robertson
confronted each other. Bob Robertson's eyes narrowed. &quot;Why, hello,
Gilbert. What are you doing at home?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray pointed to the parcel Bob Robertson carried.
&quot;What do you have there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh, these?&quot; Bob Robertson looked down at the
parcel as if he had forgotten it. &quot;Just some books for Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray found it hard to control his voice. &quot;You're up to
some mischief, you and your Rumfuddlers. Listen, Bob: Keep away from me and
Elizabeth. Don't call here, and don't bring around any books. Is this definite
enough?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob raised his sun-bleached eyebrows. &quot;Very definite,
very explicit. But why the sudden rage? I'm just friendly old Uncle Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't care what you call yourself; stay away from
us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Just as you like, of course. But do you mind
explaining this sudden decree of banishment?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The reason is simple enough. We want to be left
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob made a gesture of mock despair. &quot;All this over a
simple invitation to a simple little party, which I'd really like you to come
to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't expect us. We won't be there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob's face suddenly went pink. &quot;You're coming a very
high horse over me, my lad, and it's a poor policy. You might just get hauled
up with a jerk. Matters aren't all the way you think they are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't care a rap one way or another,&quot; said
Duray. &quot;Good-bye.&quot; He closed the locker door and backed through the
passway. He returned into the living room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth called from the kitchen. &quot;Who was it,
dear?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bob Robertson, with some books.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Books? Why books?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I didn't trouble to find out. I told him to stay away.
After this, if he's at the passway, don't open it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth looked at him intently. &quot;Gil—you're so
strange today! There's something about you that almost scares me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your imagination is working too hard.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why should Bob trouble to bring me books? What sort of
books? Did you see?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Demonology. Black magic. That sort of thing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mmf. Interesting—but not all <span
class=ItalicCharacter>that </span>interesting…I wonder if a world like ours,
where no one has ever lived would, have things like goblins and ghosts?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I suspect not,&quot; said Duray. He looked toward the
door. There was nothing more to be accomplished here, and it was time to return
to his own Earth. He wondered how to make a graceful departure. And what would
occur when the Gilbert Duray now working his rig came home?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray said, &quot;Elizabeth, sit down in this chair
here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth slowly slid into the chair at the kitchen table
and watched him with a puzzled gaze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This may come as a shock,&quot; he said. &quot;I am
Gilbert Duray, but not your personal Gilbert Duray. I'm his cognate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth's eyes widened to lustrous dark pools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray said, &quot;On my own world Bob Robertson caused me
and my Elizabeth trouble. I came here to find out what he had done and why and
to stop him from doing it again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth asked, &quot;What has he done?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I still don't know. He probably won't bother you
again. You can tell your personal Gilbert Duray whatever you think best, or
even complain to Alan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm bewildered by all this!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No more so than I.&quot; He went to the door.
&quot;I've got to leave now. Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth jumped to her feet and came impulsively forward.
&quot;Don't say good-bye. It was such a lonesome sound, coming from you…It's
like my own Gilbert saying good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There's nothing else to do. Certainly I can't follow
my inclinations and move in with you. What good are two Gilberts? Who'd get to
sit at the head of the table?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We could have a round table,&quot; said Elizabeth.
&quot;Room for six or seven. I like my Gilberts.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your Gilberts like their Elizabeths.&quot; Duray
sighed and said, &quot;I'd better go now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth held out her hand. &quot;Good-bye, cognate
Gilbert.&quot;</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and
Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>The Oriental world-view differs from our own—specifically
my own—in many respects, and I was early confronted with a whole set of
dilemmas. I reflected upon Asiatic apathy and its obverse, despotism; warlords
and brain-laundries: indifference to disease, filth, and suffering; sacred apes
and irresponsible fecundity.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>I also took note of my resolve to use my machine in the
service of all men.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>In the end I decided to make the &quot;mistake&quot; of
many before me; I proceeded to impose my own ethical point of view upon the
Oriental life-style.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Since this was precisely what was expected of me, since I
would have been regarded as a fool and a mooncalf had I done otherwise, since
the rewards of cooperation far exceeded the gratifications of obduracy and
scorn, my programs are a wonderful success, at least to the moment of writing.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Duray walked along the riverbank toward Alan Robertson's
boat. A breeze sent twinkling cat's-paws across the water and bellied the sails
that Alan Robertson had raised to air; the boat tugged at the mooring lines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson, wearing white shorts and a white hat with a
loose, flapping brim, looked up from the eye he had been splicing at the end of
a halyard. &quot;Aha, Gil! You're back. Come aboard and have a bottle of
beer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray seated himself in the shade of the sail and drank half
the beer at a gulp. &quot;I still don't know what's going on—except that one
way or another Bob is responsible. He came while I was there. I told him to
clear out. He didn't like it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson heaved a melancholy sigh. &quot;I realize
that Bob has the capacity for mischief.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I still can't understand how he persuaded Elizabeth to
close the passways. He brought out some books, but what effect could they
have?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson was instantly interested. &quot;What were the
books?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Something about satanism, black magic; I couldn't tell
you much else.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Indeed, indeed!&quot; muttered Alan Robertson.
&quot;Is Elizabeth interested in the subject?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't think so. She's afraid of such things.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Rightly so. Well, well, that's disturbing.&quot; Alan
Robertson cleared his throat and made a delicate gesture, as if beseeching
Duray to geniality and tolerance. &quot;Still, you mustn't be too irritated
with Bob. He's prone to his little mischiefs, but—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot; 'Little mischiefs'!&quot; roared Duray. &quot;Like
locking me out of my home and marooning my wife and children? That's going
beyond mischief!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson smiled. &quot;Here, have another beer; cool
off a bit. Let's reflect. First, the probabilities. I doubt if Bob has really
marooned Elizabeth and the girls or caused Elizabeth to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then why are all the passways broken?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's susceptible to explanation. He has access to
the vaults; he might have substituted a blank for your master orifice. There's
one possibility, at least.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray could hardly speak for rage. At last he cried out:
&quot;He has no right to do this!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Quite right, in the largest sense. I suspect that he
only wants to induce you to his Rumfuddle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And I don't want to go, especially when he's trying to
put pressure on me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You're a stubborn man, Gil. The easy way, of course,
would be to relax and look in on the occasion. You might even enjoy
yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray glared at Alan Robertson. &quot;Are you suggesting
that I attend the affair?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well—no. I merely proposed a possible course of
action.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray drank more beer and glowered out across the river.
Alan Robertson said, &quot;In a day or so, when this business is clarified, I
think that we—all of us—should go off on a lazy cruise, out there among the
islands. Nothing to worry us, no bothers, no upsets. The girls would love such
a cruise.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray grunted. &quot;I'd like to see them again before I
plan any cruises. What goes on at these Rumfuddler events?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I've never attended. The members laugh and joke and
eat and drink and gossip about the worlds they've visited and show each other
movies: that sort of thing. Why don't we look in on last year's party? I'd be
interested myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray hesitated. &quot;What do you have in mind?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We'll set the dials to a year-old cognate to Bob's
world, Fancy, and see precisely what goes on. What do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I suppose it can't do any harm,&quot; said Duray
grudgingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson rose to his feet. &quot;Help me get these
sails in.&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and
Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>The problems that long have harassed historians have now
been resolved. Who were the Cro-Magnons; where did they evolve? Who were the
Etruscans? Where were the legendary cities of the proto-Sumerians before they
migrated to Mesopotamia? Why the identity between the ideographs of Easter
Island and Mohenjo Daro? All these fascinating questions have now been settled
and reveal to us the full scope of our early history. We have preserved the
library at old Alexandria from the Mohammedans and the Inca codices from the
Christians. The Guanches of the Canaries, the Ainu of Hokkaido, the Mandans of
Missouri, the blond Kaffirs of Bhutan: All are now known to us. We can chart
the development of every language syllable by syllable, from the earliest
formulation to the present. We have identified the Hellenic heroes, and I
myself have searched the haunted forests of the ancient North and, in their own
stone keeps, met face to face those mighty men who generated the Norse myths.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Standing before his machine, Alan Robertson spoke in a
voice of humorous self-deprecation. &quot;I'm not as trusting and forthright as
I would like to be; in fact I sometimes feel shame for my petty subterfuges,
and now I speak in reference to Bob. We all have our small faults, and Bob certainly
does not lack his share. His imagination is perhaps his greatest curse: He is
easily bored and sometimes tends to overreach himself. So while I deny him
nothing, I also make sure that I am in a position to counsel or even
remonstrate, if need be. Whenever I open a passway to one of his formulae, I
unobtrusively strike a duplicate which I keep in my private file. We will find
no difficulty in visiting a cognate to Fancy.&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Duray and Alan Robertson stood in the dusk, at the end of
a pale-white beach. Behind them rose a low basalt cliff. To their right, the
ocean reflected the afterglow and a glitter from the waning moon; to the left,
palms stood black against the sky. A hundred yards along the beach dozens of
fairy lamps had been strung between the trees to illuminate a long table laden
with fruit, confections, punch in crystal bowls. Around the table stood several
dozen men and women in animated conversation; music and the sounds of gaiety
came down the beach to Duray and Alan Robertson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We're in good time,&quot; said Alan Robertson. He
reflected a moment. &quot;No doubt we'd be quite welcome; still, it's probably
best to remain inconspicuous. We'll just stroll unobtrusively down the beach,
in the shadow of the trees. Be careful not to stumble or fall, and no matter
what you see or hear, do nothing! Discretion is essential; we want no awkward
confrontations.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keeping to the shade of the foliage, the two approached the
merry group. Fifty yards distant, Alan Robertson held up his hand to signal a
halt. &quot;This is as close as we need approach; most of the people you know,
or more accurately, their cognates. For instance, there is Royal Hart, and
there is James Parham and Elizabeth's aunt, Emma Bathurst, and her uncle Peter
and Maude Granger and no end of other folk.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They all seem very gay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, this is an important occasion for them. You and I
are surly outsiders who can't understand the fun.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Is this all they do, eat and drink and talk?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I think not,&quot; said Alan Robertson. &quot;Notice
yonder; Bob seems to be preparing a projection screen. Too bad that we can't
move just a bit closer.&quot; Alan Robertson peered through the shadows.
&quot;But we'd better take no chances; if we were discovered, everyone would be
embarrassed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They watched in silence. Presently Bob Robertson went to the
projection equipment and touched a button. The screen became alive with
vibrating rings of red and blue. Conversations halted; the group turned toward
the screen. Bob Robertson spoke, but his words were inaudible to the two who
watched from the darkness. Bob Robertson gestured to the screen, where now
appeared the view of a small country town, as if seen from an airplane.
Surrounding was flat farm country, a land of wide horizons; Duray assumed the
location to be somewhere in the Middle West. The picture changed to show the
local high school, with students sitting on the steps. The scene shifted to the
football field, on the day of a game—a very important game, to judge from the
conduct of the spectators. The local team was introduced; one by one the boys
ran out on the field to stand blinking into the autumn sunlight; then they ran
off to the pregame huddle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The game began; Bob Robertson stood by the screen in the
capacity of an expert commentator, pointing to one or another of the players,
analyzing the play. The game proceeded, to the manifest pleasure of the
Rumfuddlers. At half time the bands marched and countermarched, then play
resumed. Duray became bored and made fretful comments to Alan Robertson, who
only said: &quot;Yes, yes; probably so&quot; and &quot;My word, the agility of
that halfback!&quot; and &quot;Have you noticed the precision of the line-play?
Very good indeed!&quot; At last the final quarter ended; the victorious team
stood under a sign reading:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered><b>THE SHOWALTER TORNADOES</b></p>

<p class=NormalCentered><b>CHAMPIONS OF TEXAS</b></p>

<p class=NormalCentered><b>1951</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The players came forward to accept trophies; there was a
last picture of the team as a whole, standing proud and victorious; then the
screen burst out into a red and gold starburst and went blank. The Rumfuddlers
rose to their feet and congratulated Bob Robertson, who laughed modestly and
went to the table for a goblet of punch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray said disgustedly, &quot;Is this one of Bob's famous
parties? Why does he make such a tremendous occasion of the affair? I expected
some sort of debauch.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson said, &quot;Yes, from our standpoint at
least, the proceedings seem somewhat uninteresting. Well, if your curiosity is
satisfied, shall we return?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Whenever you like.&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Once again in the lounge under the Mad Dog Mountains, Alan
Robertson said: &quot;So now and at last we've seen one of Bob's famous
Rumfuddles. Are you still determined not to attend the occasion of tomorrow
night?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray scowled. &quot;If I have to go to reclaim my family,
I'll do so. But I just might lose my temper before the evening is over.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bob has gone too far,&quot; Alan Robertson declared.
&quot;I agree with you there. As for what we saw tonight, I admit to a degree
of puzzlement.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Only a degree? Do you understand it at all?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson shook his head with a somewhat cryptic smile.
&quot;Speculation is pointless. I suppose you'll spend the night with me at the
lodge?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I might as well,&quot; grumbled Duray. &quot;I don't
have anywhere else to go.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson clapped him on the back. &quot;Good lad!
We'll put some steaks on the fire and turn our problems loose for the
night.&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>From the <span class=ItalicCharacter>Memoirs and
Reflections:</span></p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>When I first put the Mark I machine into operation, I
suffered great fears. What did I know of the forces that I might release?…With
all adjustments at dead neutral, I punched a passway into a cognate Earth. This
was simple enough—in fact, almost anti-climactic…Little by little I learned to
control my wonderful toy; our own world and all its past phrases became
familiar to me. What of other worlds? I am sure that in due course we will move
instantaneously from world to world, from galaxy to galaxy, using a special
space-traveling hub on Utilis. At the moment I am candidly afraid to punch
through passways at blind random. What if I opened into the interior of a sun?
Or into the center of a black hole? Or into an antimatter universe? I would
certainly destroy myself and the machine and conceivably Earth itself.</p>

<p class=QuotedFlush>Still, the potentialities are too entrancing to be
ignored. With painstaking precautions and a dozen protective devices, I will
attempt to find my way to new worlds, and for the first time interstellar
travel will be a reality.</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Alan Robertson and Duray sat in the bright morning
sunlight beside the flinty-blue lake. They had brought their breakfast out to
the table and now sat drinking coffee. Alan Robertson made cheerful
conversation for the two of them. &quot;These last few years have been easier
on me; I've relegated a great deal of responsibility. Ernest and Henry know my
policies as well as I do, if not better; and they're never frivolous or
inconsistent.&quot; Alan Robertson chuckled. &quot;I've worked two miracles:
first, my machine, and second, keeping the business as simple as it is. I
refuse to keep regular hours; I won't make appointments; I don't keep records;
I pay no taxes; I exert great political and social influence, but only
informally; I simply refuse to be bothered with administrative detail, and
consequently I find myself able to enjoy life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's a wonder some religious fanatic hasn't
assassinated you,&quot; said Duray sourly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No mystery there! I've given them all their private
worlds, with my best regards, and they have no energy left for violence! And as
you know, I walk with a very low silhouette. My friends hardly recognize me on
the street.&quot; Alan Robertson waved his hand. &quot;No doubt you're more concerned
with your immediate quandary. Have you come to a decision regarding the
Rumfuddle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't have any choice,&quot; Duray muttered.
&quot;I'd prefer to wring Bob's neck. If I could account for Elizabeth's
conduct, I'd feel more comfortable. She's not even remotely interested in black
magic. Why did Bob bring her books on satanism?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well—the subject is inherently fascinating,&quot; Alan
Robertson suggested, without conviction, &quot;The name Satan derives from the
Hebrew word for 'adversary'; it never applied to a real individual. 'Zeus,' of
course, was an Aryan chieftain of about 3500 B.C., while 'Woden' lived somewhat
later. He was actually 'Othinn,' a shaman of enormous personal force who did
things with his mind that I can't do with the machine…But again I'm
rambling.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray gave a silent shrug.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well, then, you'll be going to the Rumfuddle,&quot;
said Alan Robertson, &quot;by and large the best course, whatever the
consequences.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I believe that you know more than you're telling
me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson smiled and shook his head. &quot;I've lived
with too much uncertainty among my cognate and near-cognate worlds. Nothing is
sure; surprises are everywhere. I think the best plan is to fulfill Bob's
requirements. Then, if Elizabeth is indeed on hand, you can discuss the event
with her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What of you? Will you be coming?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I am of two minds. Would you prefer that I came?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Duray. &quot;You have more control
over Bob than I do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't exaggerate my influence! He is a strong man, for
all his idleness. Confidentially, I'm delighted that he occupies himself with
games rather than…&quot; Alan Robertson hesitated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Rather than what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Than that his imagination should prompt him to less
innocent games. Perhaps I have been overingenuous in this connection. We can
only wait and see.&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalCentered>* * * * *</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush><a name=Bookmark></a>At four o'clock Duray and Alan
Robertson left the lodge and passed through Utilis to the San Francisco depot.
Duray had changed into a somber dark suit; Alan Robertson wore a more informal
costume: blue jacket and pale-gray trousers. They went to Bob Robertson's
locker, to find a panel with the sign &quot;<b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>NOT
HOME! FOR THE RUMFUDDLE GO TO ROGER WAILLE'S LOCKER, RC 3-96, AND PASS THROUGH
TO EKSHAYAN!</span></b>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two went on to Locker RC3-96, where a sign read: &quot;<b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>RUMFUDDLERS, PASS! ALL OTHERS: AWAY!</span></b>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray shrugged contemptuously, and parting the curtain,
looked through the passway into a rustic lobby of natural wood, painted in
black, red, yellow, blue, and white floral designs. An open door revealed an
expanse of open land and water glistening in the afternoon sunlight. Duray and
Alan Robertson passed through, crossed the foyer, and looked out upon a vast,
slow river flowing from north to south. A rolling plain spread eastward away
and over the horizon. The western bank of the river was indistinct in the
afternoon glitter. A path led north to a tall house of eccentric architecture.
A dozen domes and cupolas stood against the sky; gables and ridges created a
hundred unexpected angles. The walls showed a fish-scale texture of hand-hewn
shingles; spiral columns supported the second- and third-story entablatures,
where wolves and bears, carved in vigorous curves and masses, snarled, fought,
howled, and danced. On the side overlooking the river a pergola clothed with
vines cast a dappled shade; here sat the Rumfuddlers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson looked at the house, up and down the river,
across the plain. &quot;From the architecture, the vegetation, the height of
the sun, the characteristic haze, I assume the river to be either the Don or
the Volga, and yonder the steppes. From the absence of habitation, boats, and
artifacts, I would guess the time to be early historic—perhaps 2,000 or 3,000
B.C., a colorful era. The inhabitants of the steppes are nomads; Scyths to the
east, Celts to the west, and to the north the homeland of the Germanic and
Scandinavian tribes; and yonder the mansion of Roger Waille, and very
interesting, too, after the extravagant fashion of the Russian baroque. And, my
word! I believe I see an ox on the spit! We may even enjoy our little
visit!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You do as you like,&quot; muttered Duray. &quot;I'd
just as soon eat at home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson pursed his lips. &quot;I understand your
point of view, of course, but perhaps we should relax a bit. The scene is
majestic; the house is delightfully picturesque; the roast beef is undoubtedly
delicious; perhaps we should meet the situation on its own terms.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray could find no adequate reply and kept his opinions to
himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Alan Robertson,
&quot;equability is the word. So now let's see what Bob and Roger have up their
sleeves.&quot; He set off along the path to the house, with Duray sauntering
morosely a step or two behind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the pergola a man jumped to his feet and flourished
his hand; Duray recognized the tall, spare form of Bob Robertson. &quot;Just in
time,&quot; Bob called jocosely. &quot;Not too early, not too late. We're glad
you could make it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, we found we could accept your invitation after
all,&quot; said Alan Robertson. &quot;Let me see, do I know anyone here? Roger,
hello!…And William…Ah! the lovely Dora Gorski!…Cypriano…&quot; He looked around
the circle of faces, waving to his acquaintances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob clapped Duray on the shoulder. &quot;Really pleased you
could come! What'll you drink? The locals distill a liquor out of fermented
mare's milk, but I don't recommend it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm not here to drink,&quot; said Duray. &quot;Where's
Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The corners of Bob's wide mouth twitched. &quot;Come now,
old man; let's not be grim. This is the Rumfuddle! A time for joy and
self-renewal! Go dance about a bit! Cavort! Pour a bottle of champagne over
your head! Sport with the girls!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray looked into the blue eyes for a long second. He
strained to keep his voice even. &quot;Where is Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Somewhere about the place. A charming girl, your
Elizabeth! We're delighted to have you both!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray swung away. He walked to the dark and handsome Roger
Waille. &quot;Would you be good enough to take me to my wife?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Waille raised his eyebrows as if puzzled by Duray's tone of
voice. &quot;She is primping and gossiping. If necessary I suppose I could pull
her away for a moment or two.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray began to feel ridiculous, as if he had been locked
away from his world, subjected to harrassments and doubts, and made the butt of
some obscure joke. &quot;It's necessary,&quot; he said. &quot;We're
leaving.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But you've just arrived!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Waille gave a shrug of amused perplexity and turned away
toward the house. Duray followed. They went through a tall, narrow doorway into
an entry-hall paneled with a beautiful brown-gold wood that Duray automatically
identified as chestnut. Four high panes of tawny glass turned to the west
filled the room with a smoky half-melancholy light. Oak settees, upholstered in
leather, faced each other across a black, brown, and gray rug. Taborets stood
at each side of the settees, and each supported an ornate golden candelabra in
the form of conventionalized stag's heads. Waille indicated these last.
&quot;Striking, aren't they? The Scythians made them for me. I paid them in
iron knives. They think I'm a great magician; and for a fact, I am.&quot; He
reached into the air and plucked forth an orange, which he tossed upon a
settee. &quot;Here's Elizabeth now, and the other maenads as well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Into the chamber came Elizabeth, with three other young
women whom Duray vaguely recalled having met before. At the sight of Duray,
Elizabeth stopped short. She essayed a smile and said in a light, strained
voice, &quot;Hello, Gil. You're here after all.&quot; She laughed nervously
and, Duray felt, unnaturally. &quot;Yes of course you're here. I didn't think
you'd come.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray glanced toward the other women, who stood with Waille,
watching half expectantly. Duray said, &quot;I'd like to speak to you
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Excuse us,&quot; said Waille. &quot;We'll go on
outside.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They departed. Elizabeth looked longingly after them and
fidgeted with the buttons of her jacket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Where are the children?&quot; Duray demanded curtly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Upstairs, getting dressed.&quot; She looked down at
her own costume, the festival raiment of a Transylvanian peasant girl: a green
skirt embroidered with red and blue flowers, a white blouse, a black velvet
vest, glossy black boots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray felt his temper slipping; his voice was strained and
fretful. &quot;I don't understand anything of this. Why did you close the
passways?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth attempted a flippant smile. &quot;I was bored with
routine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh? Why didn't you mention it to me yesterday morning?
You didn't need to close the passways.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Gilbert, please. Let's not discuss it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray stood back, tongue-tied with astonishment. &quot;Very
well,&quot; he said at last. &quot;We won't discuss it. You go up and get the
girls. We're going home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth shook her head. In a neutral voice she said,
&quot;It's impossible. There's only one passway open. I don't have it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Who does? Bob?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I guess so; I'm not really sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;How did he get it? There were only four, and all four
were closed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's simple enough. He moved the downtown passway from
our locker to another and left a blank in its place.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And who closed off the other three?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I did.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Because Bob told me to. I don't want to talk about it;
I'm sick to death of the whole business.&quot; And she half whispered: &quot;I
don't know what I'm going to do with myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know what I'm going to do,&quot; said Duray. He
turned toward the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth held up her hands and clenched her fists against
her breast. &quot;Don't make trouble—please! He'll close our last
passway!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Is that why you're afraid of him? If so—don't be. Alan
wouldn't allow it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth's face began to crumple. She pushed past Duray and
walked quickly out upon the terrace. Duray followed, baffled and furious. He
looked back and forth across the terrace. Bob was not to be seen. Elizabeth had
gone to Alan Robertson; she spoke in a hushed, urgent voice. Duray went to join
them. Elizabeth became silent and turned away, avoiding Duray's gaze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson spoke in a voice of easy geniality.
&quot;Isn't this a lovely spot? Look how the setting sun shines on the
river!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roger Waille came by rolling a cart with ice, goblets, and a
dozen bottles. He said: &quot;Of all the places on all the Earths this is my
favorite. I call it Ekshayan, which is the Scythian' name for this
district.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A woman asked, &quot;Isn't it cold and bleak in the
winter?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Frightful!&quot; said Waille. &quot;The blizzards howl
down from the north; then they stop, and the land is absolutely still. The days
are short, and the sun comes up red as a poppy. The wolves slink out of the
forests, and at dusk they circle the house. When a full moon shines, they howl
like banshees, or maybe the banshees are howling! I sit beside the fireplace,
entranced.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It occurs to me,&quot; said Manfred Funk, &quot;that
each person, selecting a site for his home, reveals a great deal about himself.
Even on old Earth, a man's home was ordinarily a symbolic simulacrum of the man
himself; now, with every option available, a person's house is himself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This is very true,&quot; said Alan Robertson,
&quot;and certainly Roger need not fear that he has revealed any discreditable
aspects of himself by showing us his rather grotesque home on the lonely
steppes of prehistoric Russia.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roger Waille laughed. &quot;The grotesque house isn't me; I
merely felt that it fitted its setting…Here, Duray, you're not drinking. That's
chilled vodka; you can mix it or drink it straight in the time-tested
manner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nothing for me, thanks.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Just as you like. Excuse me; I'm wanted
elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Waille moved away, rolling the cart. Elizabeth leaned as if
she wanted to follow him, then remained beside Alan Robertson, looking
thoughtfully over the river.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray spoke to Alan Robertson as if she were not there.
&quot;Elizabeth refuses to leave. Bob has hypnotized her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's not true,&quot; said Elizabeth softly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Somehow, one way or another, he's forced her to stay.
She won't tell me why.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I want the passway back,&quot; said Elizabeth. But her
voice was muffled and uncertain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson cleared his throat. &quot;I hardly know what
to say. It's a very awkward situation. None of us wants to create a
disturbance—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There you're wrong,&quot; said Duray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson ignored the remark. &quot;I'll have a word
with Bob after the party. In the meantime I don't see why we shouldn't enjoy
the company of our friends, and that wonderful roast ox! Who is that turning
the spit? I know him from somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray could hardly speak for outrage. &quot;After what he's
done to us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He's gone too far, much too far,&quot; Alan Robertson
agreed. &quot;Still, he's a flamboyant, feckless sort, and I doubt if he
understands the full inconvenience he's caused you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He understands well enough. He just doesn't
care.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Perhaps so,&quot; said Alan Robertson sadly. &quot;I
had always hoped—but that's neither here nor there. I still feel that we should
act with restraint. It's much easier not to do than to undo.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth abruptly crossed the terrace and went to the front
door of the tall house, where her three daughters had appeared—Dolly, twelve;
Joan, ten; Ellen, eight—all wearing green, white, and black peasant frocks and
glossy black boots. Duray thought they made a delightful picture. He followed
Elizabeth across the terrace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's Daddy,&quot; screamed Ellen, and threw herself in
his arms. The other two, not to be outdone, did likewise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We thought you weren't coming to the party,&quot;
cried Dolly. &quot;I'm glad you did, though.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So'm I.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So'm I.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm glad I came, too, if only to see you in these
pretty costumes. Let's go see Grandpa Alan.&quot; He took them across the
terrace, and after a moment's hesitation, Elizabeth followed. Duray became
aware that everyone had stopped talking to look at him and his family, with, so
it seemed, an extraordinary, even avid, curiosity, as if in expectation of some
entertaining extravagance of conduct. Duray began to burn with emotion. Once,
long ago, while crossing a street in downtown San Francisco, he had been struck
by an automobile, suffering a broken leg and a fractured clavicle. Almost as
soon as he had been knocked down, pedestrians came pushing to stare down at
him, and Duray, looking up in pain and shock, had seen only the ring of white
faces and intent eyes, greedy as flies around a puddle of blood. In hysterical
fury he had staggered to his feet, striking out into every face within reaching
distance, man and woman alike. He hated them more than the man who had run him
down: the ghouls who had come to enjoy his pain. Had he the miraculous power,
he would have crushed them into a screaming bale of detestable flesh and hurled
the bundle twenty miles out into the Pacific Ocean…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some faint shadow of this emotion affected him now, but
today he would provide them no unnatural pleasure. He turned a single glance of
cool contempt around the group, then took his three eager-faced daughters to a
bench at the back of the terrace. Elizabeth followed, moving like a mechanical
object. She seated herself at the end of the bench and looked off across the
river. Duray stared heavily back at the Rumfuddlers, compelling them to shift
their gazes to where the ox roasted over a great bed of coals. A young man in a
white jacket turned the spit; another basted the meat with a long-handled
brush. A pair of Orientals carried out a carving table; another brought a
carving set; a fourth wheeled out a cart laden with salads, round crusty
loaves, trays of cheese and herrings. A fifth man, dressed as a Transylvanian
gypsy, came from the house with a violin. He went to the corner of the terrace
and began to play melancholy music of the steppes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob Robertson and Roger Waille inspected the ox, a
magnificent sight indeed. Duray attempted a stony detachment, but his nose was
under no such strictures; the odor of the roast meat, garlic, and herbs
tantalized him unmercifully. Bob Robertson returned to the terrace and held up
his hands for attention; the fiddler put down his instrument. &quot;Control
your appetites; there'll still be a few minutes, during which we can discuss
our next Rumfuddle. Our clever colleague Bernard Ulman recommends a hostelry in
the Adirondacks: the Sapphire Lake Lodge. The hotel was built in 1902, to the
highest standards of Edwardian comfort. The clientele is derived from the
business community of New York. The cuisine is kosher; the management maintains
an atmosphere of congenial gentility; the current date is 1930. Bernard has
furnished photographs. Roger, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Waille drew back a curtain to reveal a screen. He
manipulated the projection machine, and the hotel was displayed on the screen:
a rambling, half-timbered structure overlooking several acres of park and a
smooth lake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you, Roger. I believe that we also have a
photograph of the staff.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the screen appeared a stiffly posed group of about thirty
men and women, all smiling with various degrees of affability. The Rumfuddlers
were amused; some among them tittered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bernard gives a very favorable report as to the
cuisine, the amenities, and the charm of the general area. Am I right,
Bernard?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;In every detail,&quot; declared Bernard Ulman.
&quot;The management is attentive and efficient; the clientele is
well-established.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Very good,&quot; said Bob Robertson. &quot;Unless
someone has a more entertaining idea, we will hold our next Rumfuddle at the
Sapphire Lake Lodge. And now I believe that the roast beef should be ready—done
to a turn, as the expression goes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Quite right,&quot; said Roger Waille. &quot;Tom, as
always, has done an excellent job at the spit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ox was lifted to the table. The carver set to work with
a will. Duray went to speak to Alan Robertson, who blinked uneasily at his
approach. Duray asked, &quot;Do you understand the reason for these parties?
Are you in on the joke?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson spoke in a precise manner: &quot;I certainly
am not 'in on the joke,' as you put it.&quot; He hesitated, then said:
&quot;The Rumfuddlers will never again intrude upon your life or that of your
family. I am sure of this. Bob became over exuberant; he exercised poor
judgment, and I intend to have a quiet word with him. In fact, we have already
exchanged certain opinions. At the moment your best interests will be served by
detachment and unconcern.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray spoke with sinister politeness: &quot;You feel, then,
that I and my family should bear the brunt of Bob's jokes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This is a harsh view of the situation, but my answer
must be Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm not so sure. My relationship with Elizabeth is no
longer the same. Bob has done this to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;To quote an old apothegm: 'Least said, soonest
mended.' &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray changed the subject. &quot;When Waille showed the
photograph of the hotel staff, I thought some of the faces were familiar.
Before I could be quite sure, the picture was gone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson nodded unhappily. &quot;Let's not develop the
subject, Gilbert. Instead—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm into the situation too far,&quot; said Duray.
&quot;I want to know the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Very well, then,&quot; said Alan Robertson hollowly,
&quot;your instincts are accurate. The management of the Sapphire Lake Lodge,
in cognate circumstances, has achieved an unsavory reputation. As you have
guessed, they comprise the leadership of the National Socialist party during
1938 or thereabouts. The manager, of course, is Hitler, the desk clerk is
Goebbels, the headwaiter is Goring, the bellboys are Himmler and Hess, and so
on down the line. They are, of course, not aware of the activities of their
cognates on other worlds. The hotel's clientele is for the most part Jewish,
which brings a macabre humor to the situation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Undeniably,&quot; said Duray. &quot;What of that
Rumfuddlers party that we looked in on?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You refer to the high-school football team? The 1951
Texas champions, as I recall.&quot; Alan Robertson grinned. &quot;And well they
should be. Bob identified the players for me. Are you interested in the
lineup?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Very much so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson drew a sheet of paper from his pocket.
&quot;I believe—yes, this is it.&quot; He handed the sheet to Duray, who saw a
schematic lineup:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray returned the paper. &quot;You approve of this?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I had best put it like this,&quot; said Alan
Robertson, a trifle uneasily. &quot;One day, chatting with Bob, I remarked that
much travail could be spared the human race if the most notorious evildoers
were early in their lives shifted to environments which afforded them constructive
outlets for their energies, I speculated that having the competence to make
such changes, it was perhaps our duty to do so. Bob became interested in the
concept and formed his group, the Rumfuddlers, to serve the function I had
suggested. In all candor I believe that Bob and his friends have been attracted
more by the possibility of entertainment than by altruism, but the effect has
been the same.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The football players aren't evildoers,&quot; said
Duray. &quot;Sir Galahad, Charlemagne, Samson, Richard the Lion-Hearted…&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Exactly true,&quot; said Alan Robertson, &quot;and I
made this point to Bob. He asserted that all were brawlers and bully-boys, with
the possible exception of Sir Galahad; that Charlemagne, for example, had
conquered much territory to no particular achievement; that Achilles, a
national hero to the Greeks, was a cruel enemy to the Trojans; and so forth.
His justifications are somewhat specious perhaps…Still, these young men are
better employed making touchdowns than breaking heads.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a pause Duray asked: &quot;How are these matters
arranged?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm not entirely sure. I believe that by one means or
another, the desired babies are exchanged with others of similar appearance.
The child so obtained is reared in appropriate circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The jokes seem elaborate and rather tedious.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Precisely!&quot; Alan Robertson declared. &quot;Can
you think of a better method to keep someone like Bob out of mischief?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Duray. &quot;Fear of the
consequences.&quot; He scowled across the terrace. Bob had stopped to speak to
Elizabeth. She and the three girls rose to their feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray strode across the terrace. &quot;What's going
on?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nothing of consequence,&quot; said Bob.
&quot;Elizabeth and the girls are going to help serve the guests.&quot; He
glanced toward the serving table, then turned back to Duray. &quot;Would you
help with the carving?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray's arm moved of its own volition. His fist caught Bob
on the angle of the jaw and sent him reeling back into one of the white-coated
Orientals, who carried a tray of food. The two fell into an untidy heap. The
Rumfuddlers were shocked and amused and watched with attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob rose to his feet gracefully enough and gave a hand to
the Oriental. Looking toward Duray, Bob shook his head ruefully. Meeting his
glance, Duray noted a pale-blue glint; then Bob once more became bland and
debonair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth spoke in a low despairing voice: &quot;Why couldn't
you have done as he asked? It would have all been so simple.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Elizabeth may well be right,&quot; said Alan
Robertson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why should she be right?&quot; demanded Duray.
&quot;We are his victims! You've allowed him a taste of mischief, and now you
can't control him!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Not true!&quot; declared Alan. &quot;I intend to
impose rigorous curbs upon the Rumfuddlers, and I will be obeyed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The damage is done, so far as I am concerned,&quot;
said Duray bitterly. &quot;Come along, Elizabeth, we're going Home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We can't go Home. Bob has the passway.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson drew a deep sigh and came to a decision. He
crossed to where Bob stood with a goblet of wine in one hand, massaging his jaw
with the other. Alan Robertson spoke to Bob politely but with authority. Bob
was slow in making a reply. Alan Robertson spoke again, sharply. Bob only
shrugged. Alan Robertson waited a moment, then returned to Duray, Elizabeth,
and the three children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The passway is at his San Francisco apartment,&quot;
said Alan Robertson in a measured voice. &quot;He will give it back to you
after the party. He doesn't choose to go for it now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob once more commanded the attention of the Rumfuddlers.
&quot;By popular request we replay the record of our last but one Rumfuddle,
contrived by one of our most distinguished, diligent, and ingenious
Rumfuddlers, Manfred Funk. The locale is the Red Barn, a roadhouse twelve miles
west of Urbana, Illinois; the time is the late summer of 1926; the occasion is
a Charleston dancing contest. The music is provided by the legendary
Wolverines, and you will hear the fabulous cornet of Leon Bismarck
Beiderbecke.&quot; Bob gave a wry smile, as if the music were not to his
personal taste. &quot;This was one of our most rewarding occasions, and here it
is again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The screen showed the interior of a dance-hall, crowded with
excited young men and women. At the back of the stage sat the Wolverines,
wearing tuxedos; to the front stood the contestants: eight dapper young men and
eight pretty girls in short skirts. An announcer stepped forward and spoke to
the crowd through a megaphone: &quot;Contestants are numbered one through
eight! Please, no encouragement from the audience. The prize is this
magnificent trophy and fifty dollars cash; the presentation will be made by
last year's winner, Boozy Horman. Remember, on the first number we eliminate
four contestants, on the second number, two; and after the third number we
select our winner. So then: Bix and the Wolverines and 'Sensation Rag'!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the band came music; from the contestants, agitated
motion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray asked, &quot;Who are these people?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson replied in an even voice: &quot;The young men
are locals and not important. But notice the girls: No doubt you find them
attractive. You are not alone. They are Helen of Troy, Deirdre, Marie
Antoinette, Cleopatra, Salome, Lady Godiva, Nefertiti, and Mata Hari.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray gave a dour grunt. The music halted; judging applause
from the audience, the announcer eliminated Marie Antoinette, Cleopatra,
Deirdre, Mata Hari, and their respective partners. The Wolverines played
&quot;Fidgety Feet&quot;; the four remaining contestants danced with verve and
dedication, but Helen and Nefertiti were eliminated. The Wolverines played
&quot;Tiger Rag.&quot; Salome and Lady Godiva and their young men performed
with amazing zeal. After carefully appraising the volume of applause, the
announcer gave his judgment to Lady Godiva and her partner. Large on the screen
appeared a close-up view of the two happy faces; in an excess of triumphant joy
they hugged and kissed each other. The screen went dim; after the vivacity of
the Red Barn the terrace above the Don seemed drab and insipid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Rumfuddlers shifted in their seats. Some uttered
exclamations to assert their gaiety; others stared out across the vast empty
face of the river.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray glanced toward Elizabeth; she was gone. Now he saw her
circulating among the guests with three other young women, pouring wine from
Scythian decanters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It makes a pretty picture, does it not?&quot; said a
calm voice. Duray turned to find Bob standing behind him; his mouth twisted in
an easy half-smile, but his eye glinted pale blue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray turned away. Alan Robertson said, &quot;This is not at
all a pleasant situation, Bob, and in fact completely lacks charm.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Perhaps at future Rumfuddles, when my face feels
better, the charm will emerge…Excuse me; I see that I must enliven the
meeting.&quot; He stepped forward. &quot;We have a final pastiche: oddments and
improvisations, vignettes and glimpses, each in its own way entertaining and
instructive. Roger, start the mechanism, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roger Waille hesitated and glanced sidelong toward Alan
Robertson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The item number is sixty-two, Roger,&quot; said Bob in
a calm voice. Roger Waille delayed another instant, then shrugged and went to
the projection machine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The material is new,&quot; said Bob, &quot;hence I
will supply a commentary. First we have an episode in the life of Richard
Wagner, the dogmatic and occasionally irascible composer. The year is 1843; the
place is Dresden. Wagner sets forth on a summer night to attend a new opera, <span
class=ItalicCharacter>Der Sanger Krieg, </span>by an unknown composer. He
alights from his carriage before the hall; he enters; he seats himself in his
loge. Notice the dignity of his posture, the authority of his gestures! The
music begins. Listen!&quot; From the projector came the sound of music.
&quot;It is the overture,&quot; stated Bob. &quot;But notice Wagner: Why is he
stupefied? Why is he overcome with wonder? He listens to the music as if he has
never heard it before. And in fact he hasn't; he has only just yesterday set
down a few preliminary notes for this particular opus, which he planned to call
<span class=ItalicCharacter>Tannhauser; </span>today, magically, he hears it in
its final form. Wagner will walk home slowly tonight, and perhaps in his
abstraction he will kick the dog Schmutzi…Now to a different scene: St.
Petersburg in the year 1880 and the stables in back of the Winter Palace. The
ivory and gilt carriage rolls forth to convey the czar and the czarina to a
reception at the British Embassy. Notice the drivers: stern, well-groomed,
intent at their business. Marx's beard is well-trimmed; Lenin's goatee is not
so pronounced. A groom comes to watch the carriage roll away. He has a kindly
twinkle in his eye, does Stalin.&quot; The screen went dim once more, then
brightened to show a city street lined with automobile showrooms and used-car
lots. &quot;This-is one of Shawn Henderson's projects. The four used-car lots
are operated by men who in other circumstances were religious notables:
prophets and so forth. That alert, keen-featured man in front of Quality
Motors, for instance, is Mohammed. Shawn is conducting a careful survey, and at
our next Rumfuddle he will report upon his dealings with these four famous
figures.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson stepped forward, somewhat diffidently. He
cleared his throat. &quot;I don't like to play the part of spoilsport, but I'm
afraid I have no choice. There will be no further Rumfuddles. Our original
goals have been neglected, and I note far too many episodes of purposeless
frivolity and even cruelty. You may wonder at what seems a sudden decision, but
I have been considering the matter for several days. The Rumfuddles have taken
a turn in an unwholesome direction and conceivably might become a grotesque new
vice, which, of course, is far from our original ideal. I'm sure that every
sensible person, after a few moments' reflection, will agree that now is the
time to stop. Next week you may return to me all passways except those to
worlds where you maintain residence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Rumfuddlers sat murmuring together. Some turned
resentful glances toward Alan Robertson; others served themselves more bread
and meat. Bob came over to join Alan and Duray. He spoke in an easy manner.
&quot;I must say that your admonitions arrive with all the delicacy of a
lightning bolt. I can picture Jehovah smiting the fallen angels in a similar
style.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson smiled. &quot;Now, then, Bob, you're talking
nonsense. The situations aren't at all similar. Jehovah struck out in fury; I
impose my restriction in all goodwill in order that we can once again turn our
energies to constructive ends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob threw back his head and laughed. &quot;But the
Rumfuddlers have lost the habit of work. We only want to amuse ourselves, and
after all, what is so noxious in our activities?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The trend is menacing, Bob.&quot; Alan Robertson's
voice was reasonable. &quot;Unpleasant elements are creeping into your fun, so
stealthily that you yourself are unaware of them. For instance, why torment
poor Wagner? Surely there was gratuitous cruelty, and only to provide you a few
instants of amusement. And since the subject is in the air, I heartily deplore
your treatment of Gilbert and Elizabeth. You have brought them both an
extraordinary inconvenience, and in Elizabeth's case, actual suffering. Gilbert
got something of his own back, and the balance is about even.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Gilbert is far too impulsive,&quot; said Bob.
&quot;Self-willed and egocentric, as he always has been.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan held up his hand. &quot;There is no need to go further
into the subject, Bob. I suggest that you say no more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Just as you like, though the matter, considered as
practical rehabilitation, isn't irrelevant. We can amply justify the work of
the Rumfuddlers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray asked quietly, &quot;Just how do you mean, Bob?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson made a peremptory sound, but Duray said,
&quot;Let him say what he likes and make an end to it. He plans to do so
anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a moment of silence. Bob looked across the terrace
to where the three Orientals were transferring the remains of the beef to a
service cart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well?&quot; Alan Robertson asked softly. &quot;Have
you made your choice?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob held out his hands in ostensible bewilderment. &quot;I
don't understand you! I want only to vindicate myself and the Rumfuddlers. I
think we have done splendidly. Today we have allowed Torquemada to roast a dead
ox instead of a living heretic; Marquis de Sade has fulfilled his obscure urges
by caressing seared flesh with a basting brush, and did you notice the zest
with which Ivan the Terrible hacked up the carcass? Nero, who has real talent,
played his violin; Attila, Genghis Khan, and Mao Tse-tung efficiently served the
guests. Wine was poured by Messalina, Lucrezia Borgia, Delilah, and Gilbert's
charming wife, Elizabeth. Only Gilbert failed to demonstrate his
rehabilitation, but at least he provided us a touching and memorable picture:
Gilles de Rais, Elizabeth Bathory, and their three virgin daughters. It was
sufficient. In every case we have shown that rehabilitation is not an empty
word.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Not in every case,&quot; said Alan Robertson,
&quot;specifically that of your own.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob looked at him askance. &quot;I don't follow you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No less than Gilbert are you ignorant of your
background. I will now reveal the circumstances so that you may understand
something of yourself and try to curb the tendencies which have made your
cognate an exemplar of cruelty, stealth, and treachery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob laughed: a brittle sound like cracking ice. &quot;I
admit to a horrified interest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I took you from a forest a thousand miles north of
this very spot while I traced the phylogeny of the Norse gods. Your name was
Loki. For reasons which are not now important I brought you back to San Francisco,
and there you grew to maturity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So I am Loki.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No. You are Bob Robertson, just as this is Gilbert
Duray, and here is his wife, Elizabeth. Loki, Gilles de Rais, Elizabeth
Bathory: These names applied to human material which has not functioned quite as
well. Gilles de Rais, judging from all evidence, suffered from a brain tumor;
he fell into his peculiar vices after a long and honorable career. The case of
Princess Elizabeth Bathory is less clear, but one might suspect syphilis and
consequent cerebral lesions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And what of poor Loki?&quot; inquired Bob with
exaggerated pathos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Loki seemed to suffer from nothing except a case of
old-fashioned meanness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob seemed concerned. &quot;So that these qualities apply to
me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You are not necessarily identical to your cognate.
Still, I advise you to take careful stock of yourself, and so far as I am
concerned, you had best regard yourself as on probation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Just as you say.&quot; Bob looked over Alan
Robertson's shoulder. &quot;Excuse me; you've spoiled the party, and everybody
is leaving. I want a word with Roger.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray moved to stand in his way, but Bob shouldered him
aside and strode across the terrace, with Duray glowering at his back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elizabeth said in a mournful voice, &quot;I hope we're at
the end of all this.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duray growled. &quot;You should never have listened to
him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I didn't listen; I read about it in one of Bob's
books; I saw your picture; I couldn't—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson intervened. &quot;Don't harass poor
Elizabeth; I consider her both sensible and brave; she did the best she
could.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob returned. &quot;Everything taken care of,&quot; he said
cheerfully. &quot;All except one or two details.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The first of these is the return of the passway.
Gilbert and Elizabeth—not to mention Dolly, Joan, and Ellen—are anxious to
return Home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They can stay here with you,&quot; said Bob.
&quot;That's probably the best solution.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't plan to stay here,&quot; said Alan Robertson
in mild wonder. &quot;We are leaving at once.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You must change your plans,&quot; said Bob. &quot;I
have finally become bored with your reproaches. Roger doesn't particularly care
to leave his home, but he agrees that now is the time to make a final disposal
of the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson frowned in displeasure. &quot;The joke is in
very poor taste, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roger Waille came from the house, his face somewhat glum.
&quot;They're all closed. Only the main gate is open.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson said to Gilbert: &quot;I think that we will
leave Bob and Roger to their Rumfuddle fantasies. When he returns to his
senses, we'll get your passway. Come along, then, Elizabeth! Girls!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Alan,&quot; said Bob gently, &quot;you're staying
here. Forever. I'm taking over the machine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson asked mildly: &quot;How do you propose to
restrain me? By force?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You can stay here alive or dead; take your
choice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You have weapons, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I certainly do.&quot; Bob displayed a pistol.
&quot;There are also the servants. None have brain tumors or syphilis; they're
all just plain bad.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roger said in an awkward voice, &quot;Let's go and get it
over.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson's voice took on a harsh edge. &quot;You
seriously plan to maroon us here, without food?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Consider yourself marooned.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm afraid that I must punish you, Bob, and Roger as
well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob laughed gaily. &quot;You yourself are suffering from
brain disease—megalomania. You haven't the power to punish anyone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I still control the machine, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The machine isn't here. So now—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan Robertson turned and looked around the landscape, with
a frowning air of expectation. &quot;Let me see. I'd probably come down from
the main gate; Gilbert and a group from behind the house. Yes, here we
are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Down the path from the main portal, walking jauntily, came
two Alan Robertsons with six men armed with rifles and gas grenades.
Simultaneously from behind the house appeared two Gilbert Durays and six more
men, similarly armed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bob stared in wonder. &quot;Who are these people?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Cognates,&quot; said Alan, smiling. &quot;I told you I
controlled the machine, and so do all my cognates. As soon as Gilbert and I
return to our Earth, we must similarly set forth and in our turn do our part on
other worlds cognate to this… Roger, be good enough to summon your servants. We
will take them back to Earth. You and Bob must remain here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Waille gasped in distress. &quot;Forever?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You deserve nothing better,&quot; said Alan Robertson.
&quot;Bob perhaps deserves worse.&quot; He turned to the cognate Alan
Robertsons. &quot;What of Gilbert's passway?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both replied, &quot;It's in Bob's San Francisco apartment,
in a box on the mantlepiece.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Very good,&quot; said Alan Robertson. &quot;We will
now depart. Good-bye, Bob. Good-bye, Roger. I am sorry that our association
ended on this rather unpleasant basis.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Wait!&quot; cried Roger. &quot;Take me back with
you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Alan Robertson. &quot;Come along,
then, Elizabeth. Girls! Run on ahead!&quot;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p class=NormalFlush>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalFlush>Elizabeth and the children had returned to Home; Alan
Robertson and Duray sat in the lounge above the machine. &quot;Our first
step,&quot; said Alan Robertson, &quot;is to dissolve our obligation. There
are, of course, an infinite number of Rumfuddles at Ekshayans and an infinite
number of Alans and Gilberts. If we visited a single Rumfuddle, we would, by
the laws of probability, miss a certain number of the emergency situations. The
total number of permutations, assuming that an infinite number of Alans and
Gilberts makes a random choice among an infinite number of Ekshayans, is
infinity raised to the infinite power. What percentage of this number yields
blanks for any given Ekshayan, I haven't calculated. If we visited Ekshayans
until we had by our own efforts rescued at least one Gilbert and Alan set, we
might be forced to scour fifty or a hundred worlds or more. Or we might achieve
our rescue on the first visit. The wisest course, I believe, is for you and I
to visit, say, twenty Ekshayans. If each of the Alan and Gilbert sets does the
same, then the chances for any particular Alan and Gilbert to be abandoned are
one in twenty times nineteen times eighteen times seventeen, et cetera. Even
then I think I will arrange that an operator check another five or ten thousand
worlds to gather up that one lone chance…&quot;</p>
