Jack Vance is perhaps best known as a science-fiction writer</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>—author of such
famous novels as <i>The Dragon Masters, Emphyrio, The Last Castle, The Blue
World, </i>and the five-volume “Demon Princes” series, among many others—he has
also been a seminal figure in the development of modern fantasy as well. Born

Merchant Navy. Most of the individual sto­ries that would later be melded into
his first novel, <i>The Dying Earth, </i>were written while Vance was at sea—he
was unable to sell them, a problem he would also have with the book itself, the
mar­ket for fantasy being almost non-existent at the time. <i>The Dying Earth </i>was
eventually published in an obscure edition in 1950 by a small semi-professional
press, went out of print almost immediately, and remained out of print for more
than a decade there­after. Nevertheless, it became an underground cult classic,
and its effect on future generations of writers is incalculable: for one example,
out of many, <i>The Dying Earth—</i>along with Clark Ashton Smith’s <i>Zothique,
</i>which probably influenced <i>it—</i>is one of the most recognizable
influences on Gene Wolfe’s <i>The Book of the New Sun </i>tetralogy (Wolfe has
said, for instance, that <i>The Book of Gold </i>which is mentioned by Severian
is supposed to be <i>The Dying Earth). </i>Vance returned to this <i>milieu </i>in
1965, with a series of sto­ries introducing the sly and immoral trickster Cugel
the Clever; collected in 1966 as <i>The Eyes of the Overworld, </i>the Cugel
stories too had a profound effect on the state of the art of modern fantasy. In
the early 1980s, Vance returned yet again with two collections of Cugel
stories, <i>Cugel’s Saga </i>and <i>Rhialto the Marvellous. </i>Taken together,
<i>The Dying Earth </i>and the three volumes of Cugel stories represent one of
the most impressive achievements in fan­tasy today.</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>ON THE HEIGHTS above the river
Xzan, at the site of certain ancient ruins, Lucounu the Laughing Magician had
built a manse to his private taste: an eccentric structure of steep gables,
balconies, sky-walks, cupolas, together with three spiral green glass towers
through which the red sunlight shone in twisted glints and peculiar colors.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Behind the manse and across the
valley, low hills rolled away like dunes to the limit of vision. The sun
projected shifting crescents of black shadow; otherwise the hills were
unmarked, empty, solitary. The Xzan, rising in the Old Forest to the east of
Almery, passed below, then three leagues to the west made junction with the
Scaum. Here was Azenomei, a town old beyond memory, notable now only for its
fair, which attracted folk from all the region. At Azenomei Fair Cugel had
established a booth for the sale of talismans.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel was a man of many
capabilities, with a disposition at once flexible and pertinacious. He was long
of leg, deft of hand, light of finger, soft of tongue. His hair was the
blackest of black fur, growing low down his fore-bead, coving sharply back
above his eyebrows. His darting eye, long inquisitive nose and droll mouth gave
his somewhat lean and bony face an expression of vivacity, candor, and
affability. He had known many vicissitudes, gaining therefrom a suppleness, a
fine discretion, a mastery of both bravado and stealth. Coming into the
possession of an ancient lead coffin — after discarding the contents — he had
formed a number of leaden lozenges.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Unfortunately for Cugel, not
twenty paces from his booth a certain Fianosther had established a larger booth
with articles of greater variety and more obvious efficacy, so that whenever
Cugel halted a passerby to enlarge upon the merits of his merchandise, the
passerby would like as not display an article purchased from Fianosther and go
his way.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>On the third day of the fair
Cugel had disposed of only four periapts, at prices barely above the cost of
the lead itself, while Fianosther was hard put to serve all his customers.
Hoarse from bawling futile inducements, Cugel closed down his booth and
approached Fianosther’s place of trade in order to inspect the mode of
construction and the fastenings at the door.</span></p>

said Cugel. “I am both perplexed and disappointed, for my talismans are not
obviously useless.”</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“I can resolve your perplexity,”
said Fianosther. “Your booth occupies the site of the old gibbet, and has
absorbed unlucky essences. But I thought to notice you examining the manner in
which the timbers of my booth are joined. You will obtain a better view from
within, but first I must shorten the chain of the captive erb which roams the
premises during the night.”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“No need,” said Cugel. “My
interest was cursory.”</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“As to the disappointment you
suffer,” Fianosther went on, “it need not persist. Observe these shelves. You
will note that my stock is seriously depleted.”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel acknowledged as much. “How
does this concern me?”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Fianosther pointed across the
way to a man wearing garments of black. This man was small, yellow of skin,
bald as a stone. His eyes resembled knots in a plank; his mouth was wide and
curved in a grin of chronic mirth. “There stands Lucounu the Laughing Magician,”
said Fianosther. “In a short time he will come into my booth and attempt to buy
a particular red libram, the casebook of Dibarcas Maior, who studied under
Great Phandaal. My price is higher than he will pay, but he is a patient man,
and will remonstrate for at least three hours. During this time his manse
stands untenanted. It contains a vast collection of thaumaturgical artifacts,
instruments, and activans, as well as curiosa, talismans, amulets and librams.
I’m anxious to purchase such items. Need I say more?”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“This is all very well,” said
Cugel, “but would Lucounu leave his manse without guard or attendant?”</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Fianosther held wide his hands.
“Why not? Who would dare steal from Lucounu the Laughing Magician?”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“Precisely this thought deters
me,” Cugel replied. “I am a man of resource, but not insensate recklessness.”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“There is wealth to be gained,”
stated Fianosther. “Dazzles and displays, marvels beyond worth, as well as
charms, puissances, and elixirs. But remember, I urge nothing, I counsel
nothing; if you are apprehended, you have only heard me exclaiming at the
wealth of Lucounu the Laughing Magician! But here he comes. Quick: turn your
back so that he may not see your face. Three hours he will be here, so much I

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“Greetings, Lucounu!” called
Fianosther. “Why have you delayed? I have refused munificent offers for a
certain red libram, all on your account! And here — note this casket! It was
found in a crypt near the site of old Kar-kod. It is yet sealed and who knows
what wonder it may contain? My price is a modest twelve thousand terces.”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“Interesting,” murmured
Lucounu. “The inscription — let me see.... Hmm. Yes, it is authentic. The
casket contains calcined fish-bone, which was used throughout Grand Motholam as
a purgative. It is worth perhaps ten or twelve terces as a curio. I own caskets
eons older, dating back to the Age of Glow.”</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel sauntered to the door,
gained the street, where he paced back and forth, considering every detail of
the proposal as explicated by Fianosther. Superficially the matter seemed
reasonable: here was Lucounu; there was the manse, bulging with encompassed
wealth. Certainly no harm could result from simple reconnaissance. Cugel set
off eastward along the banks of the Xzan.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>The twisted turrets of green
glass rose against the dark blue sky, scarlet sunlight engaging itself in the
volutes. Cugel paused, made a careful appraisal of the countryside. The Xzan
flowed past without a sound. Nearby, half-concealed among black poplars, pale
green larch, drooping pall-willow, was a village — a dozen stone huts inhabited
by bargemen and tillers of the river terraces — folk engrossed in their own
concerns.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel studied the approach to
the manse: a winding way paved with dark brown tile. Finally he decided that
the more frank his approach the less complex need be his explanations, if such
were demanded. He began the climb up the hillside, and Lucounu’s manse reared
above him. Gaining the courtyard, he paused to search the landscape. Across the
river hills rolled away into the dimness, as far as the eye could reach.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel marched briskly to the
door, rapped, but evoked no response. He considered. If Lucounu, like
Fianosther, maintained a guardian beast, it might be tempted to utter a sound
if provoked. Cugel called out in various tones: growling, mewing, yammering.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>He walked gingerly to a window
and peered into a hall draped in pale gray, containing only a tabouret on
which, under a glass bell jar, lay a dead rodent. Cugel circled the manse,
investigating each window as he came to it, and finally reached the great hall
of the ancient castle. Nimbly he climbed the rough stones, leapt across to one
of Lucounu’s fanciful parapets and in a trice had gained access to the manse.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>He stood in a bed chamber. On a
dais six gargoyles supporting a couch turned heads to glare at the intrusion.
With two stealthy strides Cugel gained the arch which opened into an outer
chamber. Here the walls were green and the furnishings black and pink. He left
the room for a balcony circling a central chamber, light.streaming through oriels
high in the walls. Below were cases, chests, shelves and racks containing all
manner of objects: Lucounu’s marvelous collection.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel stood poised, tense as a
bird, but the quality of the silence reassured him: the silence of an empty
place. Still, he trespassed upon the property of Lucounu the Laughing Magician,
and vigilance was appropriate.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel strode down a sweep of
circular stairs into a great hall. He stood enthralled, paying Lucounu the
tribute of unstinted wonder. But his time was limited; he must rob swiftly and
be on his way. Out came his sack; he roved the hall, fastidiously selecting
those objects of small bulk and great value: a small pot with antlers, which
emitted clouds of remarkable gasses when the prongs were tweaked; an ivory horn
through which sounded voices from the past; a small stage where costumed imps
stood ready to perform comic antics; an object like a cluster of crystal
grapes, each affording a blurred view into one of the demon-worlds; a baton
sprouting sweetmeats of assorted flavor; an ancient ring engraved with runes; a
black stone surrounded by nine zones of impalpable color. He passed by hundreds
of jars of powders and liquids, likewise forebore from the vessels containing
preserved heads. Now he came to shelves stacked with volumes, folios and
librams, where he selected with care, taking for preference those bound in
purple velvet, Phandaal’s characteristic color. He likewise selected folios of
drawings and ancient maps, and .the disturbed leather exuded a musty odor.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>He circled back to the front of
the hall past a case displaying a score of small metal chests, sealed with
corroded bands of great age. Cugel selected three at random; they were
unwontedly heavy. He passed by several massive engines whose purpose he would
have liked to explore, but time was advancing, and best he should be on bis
way, back to Azenomei and the booth of Fianosther....</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel frowned. In many respects
the prospect seemed impractical. Fianosther would hardly choose to pay full
value for his goods, or, more accurately, Lucounu’s goods. It might be well to
bury a certain proportion of the loot in an isolated place.... Here was an
alcove Cugel had not previously noted. A soft light welled like water against
the crystal pane, which separated alcove from hall. A niche to the rear
displayed a complicated object of great charm. As best Cugel could distinguish,
it seemed a miniature carousel on which rode a dozen beautiful dolls of seeming
vitality. The object was clearly of great value, and Cugel was pleased to find
an aperture in the crystal pane.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>He stepped through, but two
feet before him a second pane blocked his way, establishing an avenue which
evidently led to the magic whirligig. Cugel proceeded confidently, only to be
stopped by another pane which he had not seen until he bumped into it. Cugel
retraced his steps and to his gratification found the doubtlessly correct
entrance a few feet back. But this new avenue led him by several right angles
to another blank pane. Cugel decided to forego acquisition of the carousel and
depart the castle. He turned, but discovered himself to be a trifle confused.
He had come from his left — or was it his right?</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Pausing by the alcove, Lucounu
gave Cugel a stare of humorous astonishment. “What have we here? A visitor? And
I have been so remiss as to keep you waiting! Still, I see you have amused
yourself, and I need feel no mortification.” Lucounu permitted a chuckle to
escape his lips. He then pretended to notice Cugel’s bag. “What is this? You
have brought objects for my examination? Excellent! I am always anxious to
enhance my collection, in order to keep pace with the attrition of the years.
You would be astounded to learn of the rogues who seek to despoil me! That
merchant of claptrap in his tawdry little booth, for instance — you could not
conceive his frantic efforts in this regard! I tolerate him because to date he
has not been. bold enough to venture himself into my manse. But come, step out
here into the hall, and we will examine the contents of your bag.”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel bowed graciously. “Gladly.
As you assume, I have indeed been waiting for your return. If I recall
correctly, the exit is by this passage....” He stepped forward, but again was
halted. He made a gesture of rueful amusement. “I seem to have taken a wrong
turning.”</span></p>

flexion of the lunules you will be guided to the hall.”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

stepped forward in accordance with the directions.</span></p>

the sack, once more set forth, and presently emerged into the hall. Lucounu
made a suave gesture. “If you will step this way I will be glad to examine your

along the corridor toward the front entrance. “It would be a presumption upon

will take my leave.”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

heartily. “I have a few visitors, most of whom are rogues and thieves. I handle
them severely, I assure you! I insist that you at least take some refreshment.
Place your bag on the floor.”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel carefully set down the
bag. “Recently I was instructed in a small competence by a sea-hag of White
Alster. I believe you will be interested, I require several ells of stout cord.”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“You excite my curiosity!”
Lucounu extended his arm; a panel in the wainscoting slid back; a coil of rope
was tossed to his hand. Rubbing his face as if to conceal a smile, Lucounu
handed the rope to Cugel, who shook it out with great care.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>“Yes, of course.” Lucounu held
out his hand, pointed a finger. The rope coiled around Cugel’s arms and legs,
pinning him so that he was unable to move. Lucounu’s grin nearly split his
great soft head. “This is a surprising development! By error I called forth
Thief-taker! For your own comfort, do not strain, as Thief-taker is woven of
wasp-legs. Now then, I will examine the contents of your bag.” He peered into
Cugal’s sack and emitted a soft cry of dismay. “You have rifled my collection!
I note certain of my most treasured valuables!”</span></p>

offense is far too serious for flippant disclaimers. I have stated my
abhorrence for plunderers and thieves, and now I must visit upon you justice in
its most unmitigated rigor — unless, of course, you can suggest an adequate
requital.”</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>The rope relaxed, allowing
Cugel to hobble after Lucounu into a side chamber hung with intricately
embroidered tapestry. From a cabinet Lucounu brought a small case and laid it
on a floating disk of glass. He opened the case and gestured to Cugel, who
perceived that the box showed two indentations lined with scarlet fur, where
reposed a single small hemisphere of filmed violet glass.</span></p>

traveled man,” suggested Lucounu, “you doubtless recognize this object. No? You
are familiar, of course, with the Cutz Wars of the Eighteenth Aeon? No?”
Lucounu hunched up his shoulders in astonishment. “During these ferocious
events the demon Unda-Hrada — he listed as 16-04 Green in Thrump’s Almanac —
thought to assist his principals, and to this end thrust certain agencies up
from the sub-world La-Er. In order that they might perceive, they were tipped
with cusps similar to the one you see before you. When events went amiss, the
demon snatched himself back to La-Er. The hemispheres were dislodged and
broadcast across Cutz. One of these, as you see, I own. You must procure its
mate and bring it to me, whereupon your trespass shall be overlooked.”</span></p>

shouted that invocation known as Thas-drubal’s Laganetic Transfer. From high
came a thud and a buffet, a muffled bellow of rage.</span></p>

From above came a flapping and creaking of vast wings and dismal lamentation;
the cage swung back and forth. Below all was dark, a blackness like a pit. By
the disposition of the stars Cugel perceived that the course was to the north,
and presently he sensed the thrust of the Maurenron Mountains below; and then
they flew over that wilderness known as the Land of the Falling Wall. Once or
twice Cugel glimpsed the lights of an isolated castle, and once he noted a
great bonfire. For a period a winged sprite came to fly alongside the cage and
peer within. It seemed to find Cugel’s plight amusing, and when Cugel sought
information as to the land below, it merely uttered raucous cries of mirth. It
became fatigued and sought to cling to the cage, but Cugel kicked it away, and
it fell off into the wind with a scream of envy.</span></p>

blood, and presently the sun appeared, trembling like an old man with a chill.
The ground was shrouded by mist; Cugel was barely able to see that they crossed
a land of black mountains and dark chasms. Presently the mist parted once more
to reveal a leaden sea. Once or twice he peered up, but the roof of the cage
concealed the demon except for the tips of the leathern wings.</span></p>

cage. Nursing his bruises, he called a curse after the departing demon, then
plodded back through sand and dank yellow spini-fex, and climbed the slope of
the foreshore. To the north were marshy barrens and a far huddle of low hills,
to east and west ocean and dreary beach. Cugel shook his fist to the south.
Somehow, at some time, in some manner, he would visit revenge upon the Laughing
Magician! So much he vowed.</span></p>

was the trace of an ancient sea-wall. Cugel thought to inspect it, but hardly
moved three steps before Firx clamped prongs into his liver. Cugel, rolling up
his eyes in agony, reversed his direction and set out along the shore to the
east.</span></p>

bethought himself of the charm furnished by Lucounu. He picked up a piece of

softened to the texture of cheese, retaining the flavor of driftwood. Cugel ate
with snaps and gulps. Another score against Lucounu! How the Laughing Magician
would pay!</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>The scarlet globe of the sun slid
across the southern sky. Night approached, and at last Cugel came upon human
habitation: a rude village beside a small river. The huts were like birds’-nests
of mud and sticks, and smelled vilely of ordure and filth. Among them wandered
a people as unlovely and graceless as the huts. They were squat, brutish and
obese; their hair was a coarse yellow tangle; their features were lumps. Their
single noteworthy attribute — one in which Cugel took an instant and keen
interest — was their eyes: blind-seeming violet hemispheres, similar in every
respect to that object required by Lucounu.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel approached the village
cautiously but the inhabitants took small interest in him. If the hemisphere
coveted by Lucounu were identical to the violet eyes of these folk, then a
basic uncertainty of the mission was resolved, and procuring the violet cusp
became merely a matter of tactics.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel paused to observe the
villagers, and found much to puzzle him. In the first place, they carried
themselves not as the ill-smelling loons they were, but with a remarkable
loftiness and a dignity which verged at times upon hauteur. Cugel watched in
puzzlement: were they a tribe of dotards? In any event, they seemed to pose no
threat, and he advanced into the main avenue of the village, walking gingerly
to avoid the more noxious heaps of refuse. One of the villagers now deigned to
notice him, and addressed him in grunting guttural voice. “Well, sirrah: what
is your wish? Why do you prowl the outskirts of our city Smolod?”</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

dilapidated hut. “You may eat as you will; merely enter the refectory yonder
and select what you wish; there is no stinting at Smolod.”</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel gingerly looked into the
shed, and after some exertion cleaned out the most inconvenient debris, and
arranged a trestle on which to sleep. The sun was now at the horizon and Cugel
went to that storeroom which had been identified as the refectory. The villager’s
description of the bounty available, as Cugel had suspected, was in the nature
of hyperbole. To one side of the storeroom was a heap of smoked fish, to the
other a bin containing lentils mingled with various seeds and cereals. Cugel
took a portion to his hut, where he made a glum supper.</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>The sun had set; Cugel went
forth to see what the village offered in the way of entertainment, but found
the streets deserted. In certain of the huts lamps burned, and Cugel peering
through the cracks saw the residents dining upon smoked fish or engaged in
discourse. He returned to his shed, built a small fire against the chill and
composed himself for sleep.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>The following day Cugel renewed
his observation of the village Smolod and its violet-eyed folk. None, he
noticed, went forth to work, nor did there seem to be fields near at hand. The
discovery caused Cugel dissatisfaction. In order to secure one of the violet
eyes, he would be obliged to kill its owner, and for this purpose freedom from
officious interference was essential.</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>He made tentative attempts at
conversation among the villagers, but they looked at him in a manner which
presently began to jar at Cugel’s equanimity: it was almost as if they were
gracious lords and he the ill-smelling loutl During the afternoon he strolled
south, and about a mile along the shore came upon another village. The people
were much like the inhabitants of Smolod, but with ordinary-seeming eyes. They
were likewise industrious; Cugel watched them till fields and fish the ocean.</span></p>

fishermen on their way back to the village, their catch slung over their
shoulders. They stopped, eyeing Cugel with no great friendliness. Cugel
introduced himself as a wayfarer and asked concerning the lands to the east,
but the fishermen professed ignorance otjier than the fact that the land was
barren, dreary and dangerous.</span></p>

village Smolod,” said Cugel. “I find the folk pleasant enough, but somewhat
odd. For instance, why are their eyes as they are? What Is the nature of their

self-assurance and suavity of manner?”</span></p>

through a surfeit of bliss.”</span></p>

Underherd sent up tentacles to look across Earth, each tipped with a cusp.
Simbilis the Sixteenth pained the monster, which jerked back to his subworld

struck down the loon with a gnarled root. He stripped off the best garments,
the leather hat, the leggings and foot-gear; with his knife he hacked off the
stiff straw-colored beard. Taking all and leaving the peasant lying dazed and
naked in the mud, he fled on long strides back toward Smolod. In a secluded
spot he dressed himself in the stolen garments. He examined the hacked-off
beard with some perplexity, and finally, by tying up tufts of the coarse yellow
hair and tying tuft to tuft, contrived to bind enough together to make a
straggling false beard for himself. That hair which remained he tucked up under
the brim of the flapping leather hat.</span></p>

spoke to the beardless peasant, who nodded and departed. Bubach Angh glowered
at Cugel, then went to Radkuth Vomin’s hut and sat on the heap of rubble before
the door. Here he experimented with his new cusp, cautiously closing his right
eye, opening the left to stare in wonder at the Over-world. Cugel thought to
take advantage of his absorption and sauntered off toward the edge of town.
Bubach Angh appeared not to notice. Ha! thought Cugel. It was to be so easy,
then! Two more strides and he would be lost into the darkness!</span></p>

legs to take those two strides. A slight sound — a grunt, a scrape, a rustle of
clothes — caused him to jerk aside; down swung a mattock blade, cutting the air
where his head had been. In the faint glow cast by the Smolod lamps Cugel
glimpsed the beardless peasant’s vindictive countenance. Behind him Bubach Angh
came loping, heavy head thrust forward like a bull. Cugel dodged, and ran with
agility back into the heart of Smofod.</span></p>

came an admonitory call. “Cease the bickering! I am indulging the exotic whims
of a beautiful princess and must not be distracted.” Cugel, recalling the
oleaginous wads of flesh, the leering slab-sided visages, the matted verminous
hair, the wattles and wens and evil odors which characterized the women of
Smolod, marveled anew at the power of the cusps. Bubach Angh was once more
testing the vision of his left eye. Cugel composed himself on a bench and
attempted the use of his right eye, first holding his hand before his left....</span></p>

silver scales, tight scarlet trousers, a dark blue cloak. He sat on a marble
bench before a row of spiral marble columns overgrown with dark foliage and
white flowers. To either side the palaces of Smolod towered into the night, one
behind the other, with soft lights accenting the arches and windows. The sky
was a soft dark blue, hung with great glowing stars: among the palaces were
gardens of cypress, myrtle, jasmine, sphade, thyssam; the air was pervaded with
the perfume of flowers and flowing water. From somewhere came a wisp of music:
a murmur of soft chords, a sigh of melody. Cugel took a deep breath and rose to
his feet. He stepped forward, moving across the terrace. Palaces and gardens
shifted perspective; on a dim lawn three girls in gowns of white gauze watched
him over then-shoulders.</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel took an involuntary step
forward, then, recalling the malice of Bubach Angh, paused to check on his
whereabouts. Across the plaza rose a palace of seven stories, each level with
its terrace garden, with vines and flowers trailing down the walls. Through the
windows Cugel glimpsed rich furnishings, lustrous chandeliers, the soft movement
of liveried chamberlains. On the pavilion before the palace stood a
hawk-featured man with a cropped golden beard in robes of ocher and black, with
gold epaulettes and black buskins. He stood one foot on a stone griffin, arms
on bent knee, gazing toward Cugel with an expression of brooding dislike. Cugel
marveled: could this be the pig-faced Bubach Angh? Could the magnificent
seven-tiered palace be the hovel of Radkuth Vomin?</span></p>

font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";color:black'>Cugel moved slowly off across
the plaza, and now came upon a pavilion lit by candelabra. Tables supported
meats, jellies and pastries of every description; and Cugel’s belly, nourished
only by driftwood and smoked fish, urged him forward. He passed from table to
table, sampling morsels from every dish, and found all to be of the highest
quality.</span></p>

sauntered to that area where the formal gardens surrounding the palaces gave
way to parkland. He looked over his shoulder, to find the hawk-faced prince in
ocher and black approaching, with manifestly hostile intent. In the dimness of
the park Cugel noted other movement and thought to spy a number of armored
warriors.</span></p>

for the benefit of Firx, “there will be no departure from Smolod tonight.
Naturally I am anxious to convey the cusp to Lucounu, but if I am killed then

demonstration. Now, thought Cugel, where to pass the night? The seven-tiered
palace of Radkuth Vomin manifestly offered ample and spacious accommodation for
both himself and Bubach Angh. In essence, however, the two would be crammed
together in a one-roomed hut, with a single heap of damp reeds for a couch.
Thoughtfully, regretfully,’Cugel closed his right eye, opened his left.</span></p>

Bubach Angh crouched before the door to Radkuth Votnin’s hut. Cugel stepped
forward and kicked Bubach Angh smartly. In surprise and shock, both Bubach Angh’s
eyes opened, and the rival impulses colliding in his brain induced paralysis.
Back in the darkness the beardless peasant roared and came charging forward,
mattock on high, and Cugel relinquished his plan to cut Bubach Angh’s throat.
He skipped inside the hut, closed and barred the door. He now closed his left
eye and opened his right. He found himself in the magnificent entry hall of
Radkuth Vomin’s palace, the portico of which was secured by a portcullis of
forged iron. Without, the golden-haired prince in ocher and black, holding his
hand over one eye, was lifting himself in cold dignity from the pavement of the
plaza. Raising one arm in noble defiance, Bubach Angh swung his cloak over his
shoulder and marched off to join his warriors.</span></p>

Elder aroused himself and gave Cugel a salute of measured cordiality. “I am not

say,” replied the elder. “Small personal sacrifices are sometimes essential to
the welfare of the group. I feel certain that you, if the issue arose, would
gladly offer up your cusp and enroll anew at Grodz. What are a few years? They
flutter past like butterflies.”</span></p>

myself will make do with one.”</span></p>

contingency is remote. Meanwhile you must participate in our merrymaking. If I
may say so, you cut a personable figure and certain of the princesses have been
casting sheep’s eyes in your direction. There, for instance, the lovely Udela
Narshag — and there, Zokoxa of the Rose-Petals, and beyond the vivacious Ilviu

said Cugel, and the elder went to confer with the young woman in question, who
had come riding into the plaza in a magnificent boat-shaped car which walked on
six swan-feet. The princess reclined on a couch of pink down and was beautiful
enough to make Cugel rue the fastidiousness of bis recollection, which
projected every matted hair, mole, dangling underlip, sweating seam and wrinkle
of the Smolod women to the front of his memory. This princess was indeed the
essence of a daydream: slender and supple, with skin like still cream, a
delicate nose, lucent brooding eyes, a mouth of delightful flexibility. Her
expression intrigued Cugel, for it was more complex than that of the other
princesses: pensive, yet willful; ardent yet dissatisfied.</span></p>

armed with scythes, mattocks and clubs, waited at a distance of fifty yards:
evidently the punitive committee to which Bubach Angh had referred. To one side
were the huts of Smolod; to the other the walking boat and the princess of such
— Cugel stared in astonishment. The boat was as before, walking on six
bird-legs, and sitting in the pink down was the princess — if possible, more
beautiful than ever. But now her expression, rather than faintly smiling, was
cool and still.</span></p>

long of limb, sound of wind; the peasants were stumpy, knot-muscled,
phlegmatic. He could easily run two miles to their one. He paused, and turned
to wave farewell. To his dismay two legs from the walking boat detached
themselves and leapt after him. Cugel ran for his life. In vain. The legs came
bounding past, one on either side. They swung around and kicked him to a halt.</span></p>
