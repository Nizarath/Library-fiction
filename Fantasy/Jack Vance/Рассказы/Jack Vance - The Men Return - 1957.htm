<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>The
Relict came furtively down the crag, a shambling gaunt creature with tortured
eyes. He moved in a series of quick dashes, using panels of dark air for
concealment, running behind each passing shadow, at times crawling on all
fours, head low to the ground. Arriving at the final low outcrop of rock, he
halted and peered across the plain.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>Far away rose low hills, burning
into the sky, which was mottled and sallow like poor milk-glass. The
intervening plain spread like rotten velvet, black-green and wrinkled, streaked
with ochre and rust. A fountain of liquid rock jetted high in the air, branched
out into black coral. In the middle distance a family of grey objects evolved
with a sense of purposeful destiny: spheres melted into pyramids, became domes,
tufts of white spires, sky-piercing poles; then, as a final <i>tour de force, </i>tesseracts.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>The Relict cared nothing for this;
he needed food and out on the plain were plants. They would suffice in lieu of
anything better. They grew in the ground, or sometimes on a floating lump of
water, or surrounding a core of hard black gas. There were dank black flaps of
leaf, clumps of haggard thorn, pale green bulbs, stalks with leaves and
contorted flowers. There were no recognizable species, and the Relict had no
means of knowing if the leaves and tendrils he had eaten yesterday would poison
him today.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>He tested the surface of the plain
with his foot. The glassy surface (though it likewise seemed a construction of
red and grey-green pyramids) accepted his weight, then suddenly sucked at his
leg. In a frenzy he tore himself free, jumped back, squatted on the temporarily
solid rock.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>Hunger rasped at his stomach. He
must eat. He contemplated the plain. Not too far away a pair of Organisms
played—sliding, diving, dancing, striking flamboyant poses. Should they
approach he would try to kill one of them. They resembled men, and so should
make a good meal.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>He waited. A long time? A short
time? It might have been either; duration had neither quantitative nor
qualitative reality. The sun vanished, and there was no standard cycle or
recurrence. Time was a word blank of meaning.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>Matters had not always been so. The
Relict retained a few tattered recollections of the old days, before system and
logic had been rendered obsolete. Man had dominated Earth by virtue of a single
assumption: that an effect could be traced to a cause, itself the effect of a
previous cause.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>Manipulation of this basic law
yielded rich results; there seemed no need for any other tool or
instrumentality. Man congratulated himself on his generalized structure. He
could live on desert, or plain or ice, in forest or city; Nature had not shaped
him to a special environment.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>He was unaware of his vulnerability.
Logic was the special environment; the brain was the special tool.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>Then came the terrible hour when
Earth swam into a pocket of non-causality, and all the ordered tensions of
cause-effect dissolved. The special tool was useless; it had no purchase on reality.
From the two billions of men, only a few survived—the mad. They were now the
Organisms, lords of the era, their discords so exactly equivalent to the
vagaries of the land as to constitute a peculiar wild wisdom. Or perhaps the
disorganized matter of the world, loose from the old organization, was
peculiarly sensitive to psycho-kinesis.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>A handful of others, the Relicts,
managed to exist, but only through a delicate set of circumstances. They were
the ones most strongly charged with the old causal dynamic. It persisted
sufficiently to control the metabolism of their bodies, but could extend no
further. They were fast dying out, for sanity provided no leverage against the
environment. Sometimes their own minds sputtered and angled, and they would go
raving and leaping out across the plain.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>The Organisms observed with neither
surprise nor curiosity; how could surprise exist? The mad Relict might pause by
an Organism, and try to duplicate the creature’s existence. The Organism ate a
mouthful of plant; so did the Relict. The Organism rubbed his feet with crushed
water; so did the Relict. Presently the Relict would die of poison or rent
bowels or skin lesions, while the Organism relaxed in the dank black grass. Or
the Organism might seek to eat the Relict; and the Relict would run off in
terror, unable to abide any part of the world—running, bounding, breasting the
thick air, eyes wide, mouth open, calling and gasping until finally he
foundered in a pool of black iron or blundered into a vacuum pocket, to bat
around like a fly in a bottle.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>The Relicts now numbered very few.
Finn, he who crouched on the rock overlooking the plain, lived with four
others. Two of these were old men and soon would die. Finn likewise would die
unless he found food.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>Out on the plain one of the
Organisms, Alpha, sat down, caught a handful of air, a globe of blue liquid, a
rock, kneaded them together, pulled the mixture like taffy, gave it a great
heave. It uncoiled from his hand like rope. The Relict crouched low. No telling
what deviltry would occur to the creature. He and all the rest of
them—unpredictable. The Relict valued their flesh as food; but they also would
eat him if opportunity offered. In the competition he was at a great
disadvantage. Their random acts baffled him. If, seeking to escape, he ran, the
worst terror would begin. The direction he set his face was seldom the
direction the varying frictions of the ground let him move. But the Organisms
were as random and uncommitted as the environment, and the double set of
vagaries sometimes compounded, sometimes canceled each other. In the latter
case the Organisms might catch him... </span></p>

“Notice this tall peak. Notice the layers of hard air. They bump into the peak,
they bounce off, they float in and out and disappear past the edge of sight.
Let us all climb this peak, and when a sufficiently large bank of air passes,
we will throw ourselves on top, and allow it to carry us to the beautiful
regions which may exist just out of sight.”</span></p>

style='font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>There was argument. The old man
Tagart protested his feebleness; the women derided the possibility of the
bountiful regions Finn envisioned, but presently, grumbling and arguing, they
began to clamber up the pinnacle.</span></p>

was soft as jelly, and Tagart several times professed himself at the limit of
his endurance. But still they climbed, and at last reached the pinnacle. There
was barely room to stand. They could see in all directions, far out over the
landscape, till vision was lost in the watery gray.</span></p>

various directions, but there was small sign of happier territory. In one
direction blue-green hills shivered like bladders full of oil. In another
direction lay a streak of black—a gorge or a lake of clay. In another direction
were blue-green hills— the same they had seen in the first direction; somehow
there had been a shift. Below was the plain gleaming like an iridescent beetle,
here and there pocked with black velvet spots, overgrown with questionable
vegetation.</span></p>

loitering by ponds, munching vegetable pods or small rocks or insects. There
came Alpha. He moved slowly, still awed by his vision, ignoring the other
Organisms. Their play went on, but presently they stood quiet, sharing the
oppression.</span></p>

in random directions. By chance Alpha came face to face with Finn. He prepared
to eat, but Finn picked up a rock. The rock remained a rock, hard, sharp,
heavy. Finn swung it down taking joy in the inertia. Alpha died with a crushed
skull. One of the other Organisms attempted to step across a crevasse twenty
feet wide and disappeared into it; the other sat down, swallowed rocks to
assuage his hunger, and presently went into convulsions.</span></p>
