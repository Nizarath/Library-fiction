<section>
<empty-line/><p>Howard Fair, looking over the relics of his great-uncle Gerald McIntyre, found a 
large ledger entitled:</p>
<p>WORKBOOK &amp; JOURNAL</p>
<p>Open at Peril!</p>
<p>Fair read the journal with interest, although his own work went far beyond ideas 
treated only gingerly by Gerald McIntyre.</p>
<p>"The existence of disciplines concentric to the elementary magics must now be 
admitted without further controversy," wrote McIntyre. "Guided by a set of 
analogies from the white and black magics (to be detailed in due course), I have 
delineated the basic extension of purple magic, as well as its corollary, 
Dynamic Nomism."</p>
<p>Fair read on, remarking the careful charts, the projections and expansions, the 
transpolations and transformations by which Gerald McIntyre had conceived his 
systemology. So swiftly had the technical arts advanced that McIntyre's 
expositions, highly controversial sixty years before, now seemed pedantic and 
overly rigorous.</p>
<p>"Whereas benign creatures: angels, white sprites, merrihews, sandestins--are 
typical of the white cycle; whereas demons, magners, trolls and warlocks are 
evinced by black magic; so do the purple and green cycles sponsor their own 
particulars, but these are neither good nor evil, bearing, rather, the same 
relation to the black and white provinces that these latter do to our own basic 
realm."</p>
<p>Fair reread the passage. The "green cycle"? Had Gerald McIntyre wandered into 
regions overlooked by modern workers?</p>
<p>He reviewed the journal in the light of this suspicion, and discovered 
additional hints and references. Especially provocative was a bit of scribbled 
marginalia: "More concerning my latest researches I may not state, having been 
promised an infinite reward for this forbearance."</p>
<p>The passage was dated a day before Gerald McIntyre's death, which had occurred 
on March 21, 1898, the first day of spring. McIntyre had enjoyed very little of 
his "infinite reward," whatever had been its nature... Fair returned to a 
consideration of the journal, which, in a sentence or two, had opened a chink on 
an entire new panorama. McIntyre provided no further illumination, and Fair set 
out to make a fuller investigation.</p>
<p>His first steps were routine. He performed two divinations, searched the 
standard indexes, concordances, handbooks and formularies, evoked a demon whom 
he had previously found knowledgeable: all without success. He found no direct 
reference to cycles beyond the purple; the demon refused even to speculate.</p>
<p>Fair was by no means discouraged; if anything, the intensity of his interest 
increased. He reread the journal, with particular care to the justification for 
purple magic, reasoning that McIntyre, groping for a lore beyond the purple, 
might well have used the methods which had yielded results before. Applying 
stains and ultraviolet light to the pages, Fair made legible a number of notes 
McIntyre had jotted down, then erased.</p>
<p>Fair was immensely stimulated. The notes assured him that he was on the right 
track, and further indicated a number of blind alleys which Fair profited by 
avoiding. He applied himself so successfully that before the week was out he had 
evoked a sprite of the green cycle.</p>
<p>It appeared in the semblance of a man with green glass eyes and a thatch of 
young eucalyptus leaves in the place of hair. It greeted Fair with cool courtesy, 
would not seat itself, and ignored Fair's proffer of coffee.</p>
<p>After wandering around the apartment inspecting Fair's books and curios with an 
air of negligent amusement, it agreed to respond to Fair's questions.</p>
<p>Fair asked permission to use his tape-recorder, which the sprite allowed, and 
Fair set the apparatus in motion. (When subsequently he replayed the interview, 
no sound could be heard.)</p>
<p>"What realms of magic lie beyond the green?" asked Fair.</p>
<p>"I can't give you an exact answer," replied the sprite, "because I don't know. 
There are at least two more, corresponding to the colors we call rawn and pallow, 
and very likely others."</p>
<p>Fair arranged the microphone where it would more directly intercept the voice of 
the sprite.</p>
<p>"What," he asked, "is the green cycle like? What is its physical semblance?"</p>
<p>The sprite paused to consider. Glistening mother-of-pearl films wandered across 
its face, reflecting the tinge of its thoughts. "I'm rather severely restricted 
by your use of the word 'physical'. And 'semblance' involves a subjective 
interpretation, which changes with the rise and fall of the seconds."</p>
<p>"By all means," Fair said hastily, "describe it in your own words."</p>
<p>"Well, we have four different regions, two of which floresce from the basic 
skeleton of the universe, and so subsede the others. The first of these is 
compressed and isthiated, but is notable for its wide pools of mottle which we 
use sometimes for deranging stations. We've transplanted club-mosses from Earth's 
Devonian and a few ice-fires from Perdition. They climb among the rods which we 
call devil-hair--" he went on for several minutes but the meaning almost 
entirely escaped Fair. And it seemed as if the question by which he had hoped to 
break the ice might run away with the entire interview. He introduced another 
idea.</p>
<p>" 'Can we freely manipulate the physical extensions of Earth?' " The sprite 
seemed amused. "You refer, so I assume, to the various aspects of space, time, 
mass, energy, life, thought and recollection."</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>The sprite raised its green corn-silk eyebrows. "I might as sensibly ask: can 
you break an egg by striking it with a club? The response is on a similar level 
of seriousness."</p>
<p>Fair had expected a certain amount of condescension and impatience, and was not 
abashed. "How may I learn these techniques?"</p>
<p>"In the usual manner: through diligent study."</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed--but where could I study? Who would teach me?"</p>
<p>The sprite made an easy gesture, and whorls of green smoke trailed from his 
fingers to spin through the air. "I could arrange the matter, but since I bear 
you no particular animosity, I'll do nothing of the sort. And now, I must be 
gone."</p>
<p>"Where do you go?" Fair asked in wonder and longing. "May I go with you?"</p>
<p>The sprite, swirling a drape of bright green dust over its shoulders, shook his 
head. "You would be less than comfortable."</p>
<p>"Other men have explored the worlds of magic!"</p>
<p>"True: your uncle Gerald McIntyre, for instance."</p>
<p>"My uncle Gerald learned green magic?"</p>
<p>"To the limit of his capabilities. He found no pleasure in his learning. You 
would do well to profit by his experience and modify your ambitions." The sprite 
turned and walked away.</p>
<p>Fair watched it depart. The sprite receded in space and dimension, but never 
reached the wall of Fair's room. At a distance which might have been fifty yards, 
the sprite glanced back, as if to make sure that Fair was not following, then 
stepped off at another angle and disappeared.</p>
<p>Fair's first impulse was to take heed and limit his explorations. He was an 
adept in white magic, and had mastered the black art--occasionally he evoked a 
demon to liven a social gathering which otherwise threatened to become dull--but 
he had by no means illuminated every mystery of purple magic, which is the realm 
of Incarnate Symbols.</p>
<p>Howard Fair might have turned away from the green cycle except for three factors.</p>
<p>First was his physical appearance. He stood rather under medium height, with a 
swarthy face, sparse black hair, a gnarled nose, a small heavy mouth. He felt no 
great sensitivity about his appearance, but realized that it might be improved. 
In his mind's eye he pictured the personified ideal of himself: he was taller by 
six inches, his nose thin and keen, his skin cleared of its muddy undertone. A 
striking figure, but still recognizable as Howard Fair. He wanted the love of 
women, but he wanted it without the interposition of his craft. Many times he 
had brought beautiful girls to his bed, lips wet and eyes shining; but purple 
magic had seduced them rather than Howard Fair, and he took limited satisfaction 
in such conquests.</p>
<p>Here was the first factor which drew Howard Fair back to the green lore; the 
second was his yearning for extended, perhaps eternal, life; the third was 
simple thirst for knowledge.</p>
<p>The fact of Gerald McIntyre's death, or dissolution, or Disappearance--whatever 
had happened to him--was naturally a matter of concern. If he had won to a goal 
so precious, why had he died so quickly? Was the "infinite reward" so miraculous, 
so exquisite, that the mind failed under its possession? (If such was the case, 
the reward was hardly a reward.)</p>
<p>Fair could not restrain himself, and by degrees returned to a study of green 
magic. Rather than again invoke the sprite whose air of indulgent contempt he 
had found exasperating, he decided to seek knowledge by an indirect method, 
employing the most advanced concepts of technical and cabalistic science.</p>
<p>He obtained a portable television transmitter which he loaded into his panel 
truck along with a receiver. On a Monday night in early May, he drove to an 
abandoned graveyard far out in the wooded hills, and there, by the light of a 
waning moon, he buried the television camera in graveyard clay until only the 
lens protruded from the soil.</p>
<p>With a sharp alder twig he scratched on the ground a monstrous outline. The 
television lens served for one eye, a beer bottle pushed neck-first into the 
soil the other.</p>
<p>During the middle hours, while the moon died behind wisps of pale cloud, he 
carved a word on the dark forehead; then recited the activating incantation.</p>
<p>The ground rumbled and moaned, the golem heaved up to blot out the stars.</p>
<p>The glass eyes stared down at Fair, secure in his pentagon.</p>
<p>"Speak!" called out Fair. "Enteresthes, Akmai Adonai Bidemgir! Elohim, pa 
rahulli! Enteresthes, HVOI! Speak!"</p>
<p>"Return me to earth, return my clay to the quiet clay from whence you roused me."</p>
<p>"First you must serve."</p>
<p>The golem stumbled forward to crush Fair, but was halted by the pang of 
protective magic.</p>
<p>"Serve you I will, if serve you I must."</p>
<p>Fair stepped boldly forth from the pentagon, strung forty yards of green ribbon 
down the road in the shape of a narrow V. "Go forth into the realm of green 
magic," he told the monster. "The ribbons reach forty miles; walk to the end, 
turn about, return, and then fall back, return to the earth from which you rose."</p>
<p>The golem turned, shuffled into the V of green ribbon, shaking off clods of mold, 
jarring the ground with its ponderous tread.</p>
<p>Fair watched the squat shape dwindle, recede, yet never reach the angle of the 
magic V. He returned to his panel truck, tuned the television receiver to the 
golem's eye, and surveyed the fantastic vistas of the green realm.</p>
<p>Two elementals of the green realm met on a spun-silver landscape. They were 
Jaadian and Misthemar, and they fell to discussing the earthen monster which had 
stalked forty miles through the region known as Cil; which then, turning in its 
tracks, had retraced its steps, gradually increasing its pace until at the end 
it moved in a shambling rush, leaving a trail of clods on the fragile moth-wing 
mosaics.</p>
<p>"Events, events, events," Misthemar fretted, "they crowd the chute of time till 
the bounds bulge. Or then again, the course is as lean and spare as a stretched 
tendon... But in regard to this incursion..." He paused for a period of 
reflection, and silver clouds moved over his head and under his feet.</p>
<p>Jaadian remarked, "You are aware that I conversed with Howard Fair; he is so 
obsessed to escape the squalor of his world that he acts with recklessness."</p>
<p>"The man Gerald McIntyre was his uncle," mused Misthemar. "McIntyre besought, we 
yielded; as perhaps now we must yield to Howard Fair."</p>
<p>Jaadian uneasily opened his hand, shook off a spray of emerald fire. "Events 
press, both in and out. I find myself unable to act in this regard."</p>
<p>"I likewise do not care to be the agent of tragedy."</p>
<p>A Meaning came fluttering up from below: "A disturbance among the spiral towers! 
A caterpillar of glass and metal has come clanking; it has thrust electric eyes 
into the Portinone and broke open the Egg of Innocence. Howard Fair is the fault."</p>
<p>Jaadian and Misthemar consulted each other with wry disinclination. "Very well, 
both of us will go; such a duty needs two souls in support."</p>
<p>They impinged upon Earth and found Howard Fair in a wall booth at a cocktail bar. 
He looked up at the two strangers and one of them asked, "May we join you?"</p>
<p>Fair examined the two men. Both wore conservative suits and carried cashmere 
topcoats over their arms. Fair noticed that the left thumb-nail of each man 
glistened green.</p>
<p>Fair rose politely to his feet. "Will you sit down?"</p>
<p>The green sprites hung up their overcoats and slid into the booth. Fair looked 
from one to the other. He addressed Jaadian. "Aren't you he whom I interviewed 
several weeks ago?"</p>
<p>Jaadian assented. "You have not accepted my advice."</p>
<p>Fair shrugged. "You asked me to remain ignorant, to accept my stupidity and 
ineptitude."</p>
<p>"And why should you not?" asked Jaadian gently. "You are a primitive in a 
primitive realm; nevertheless not one man in a thousand can match your 
achievements."</p>
<p>Fair agreed, smiling faintly. "But knowledge creates a craving for further 
knowledge. Where is the harm in knowledge?"</p>
<p>Misthemar, the more mercurial of the sprites, spoke angrily. "Where is the harm? 
Consider your earthen monster! It befouled forty miles of delicacy, the record 
of ten million years. Consider your caterpillar! It trampled our pillars of 
carved milk, our dreaming towers, damaged the nerve-skeins which extrude and 
waft us our Meanings."</p>
<p>"I'm dreadfully sorry," said Fair. "I meant no destruction."</p>
<p>The sprites nodded. "But your apology conveys no guarantee of restraint."</p>
<p>Fair toyed with his glass. A waiter approached the table, addressed the two 
sprites. "Something for you two gentlemen?"</p>
<p>Jaadian ordered a glass of charged water, as did Misthemar. Fair called for 
another highball.</p>
<p>"What do you hope to gain from this activity?" inquired Misthemar. "Destructive 
forays teach you nothing!"</p>
<p>Fair agreed. "I have learned little. But I have seen miraculous sights. I am 
more than ever anxious to learn."</p>
<p>The green sprites glumly watched the bubbles rising in their glasses. Jaadian at 
last drew a deep sigh. "Perhaps we can obviate toil on your part and disturbance 
on ours. Explicitly, what gains or advantages do you hope to derive from green 
magic?"</p>
<p>Fair, smiling, leaned back into the red imitation-leather cushions. "I want many 
things. Extended life--mobility in time--comprehensive memory--augmented 
perception, with vision across the whole spectrum. I want physical charm and 
magnetism, the semblance of youth, muscular endurance... Then there are 
qualities more or less speculative, such as--"</p>
<p>Jaadian interrupted. "These qualities and characteristics we will confer upon 
you. In return you will undertake never again to disturb the green realm. You 
will evade centuries of toil; we will be spared the nuisance of your presence, 
and the inevitable tragedy."</p>
<p>"Tragedy?" inquired Fair in wonder. "Why tragedy?"</p>
<p>Jaadian spoke in a deep reverberating voice. "You are a man of Earth. Your goals 
are not our goals. Green magic makes you aware of our goals."</p>
<p>Fair thoughtfully sipped his highball. "I can't see that this is a disadvantage. 
I am willing to submit to the discipline of instruction. Surely a knowledge of 
green magic will not change me into a different entity?"</p>
<p>"No. And this is the basic tragedy!"</p>
<p>Misthemar spoke in exasperation. "We are forbidden to harm lesser creatures, and 
so you are fortunate; for to dissolve you into air would end all the annoyance."</p>
<p>Fair laughed. "I apologize again for making such a nuisance of myself. But 
surely you understand how important this is to me?"</p>
<p>Jaadian asked hopefully, "Then you agree to our offer?"</p>
<p>Fair shook his head. "How could I live, forever young, capable of extended 
learning, but limited to knowledge which I already see bounds to? I would be 
bored, restless, miserable."</p>
<p>"That well may be," said Jaadian. "But not so bored, restless and miserable as 
if you were learned in green magic."</p>
<p>Fair drew himself erect. "I must learn green magic. It is an opportunity which 
only a person both torpid and stupid could refuse."</p>
<p>Jaadian sighed. "In your place I would make the same response." The sprites rose 
to their feet. "Come then, we will teach you."</p>
<p>"Don't say we didn't warn you," said Misthemar.</p>
<p>Time passed. Sunset waned and twilight darkened. A man walked up the stairs, 
entered Howard Fair's apartment. He was tall, unobtrusively muscular. His face 
was sensitive, keen, humorous; his left thumb-nail glistened green.</p>
<p>Time is a function of vital processes. The people of Earth had perceived the 
motion of their clocks. On this understanding, two hours had elapsed since 
Howard Fair had followed the green sprites from the bar.</p>
<p>Howard Fair had perceived other criteria. For him the interval had been seven 
hundred years, during which he had lived in the green realm, learning to the 
utmost capacity of his brain.</p>
<p>He had occupied two years training his senses to the new conditions. Gradually 
he learned to walk in the six basic three-dimensional directions, and accustomed 
himself to the fourth-dimensional short-cuts. By easy stages the blinds over his 
eyes were removed, so that the dazzling over-human intricacy of the landscape 
never completely confounded him.</p>
<p>Another year was spent training him to the use of a code language--an 
intermediate step between the vocalizations of Earth and the meaning patterns of 
the green realm, where a hundred symbol-flakes (each a flitting spot of delicate 
iridescence) might be displayed in a single swirl of import. During this time 
Howard Fair's eyes and brain were altered, to allow him the use of the many new 
colors, without which the meaning-flakes could not be recognized.</p>
<p>These were preliminary steps. For forty years he studied the flakes, of which 
there were almost a million. Another forty years was given to elementary 
permutations and shifts, and another forty to parallels, attenuation, 
diminishments and extensions; and during this time he was introduced to flake 
patterns, and certain of the more obvious displays.</p>
<p>Now he was able to study without recourse to the code language, and his progress 
became more marked. Another twenty years found him able to recognize more 
complicated Meanings, and he was introduced to a more varied program. He floated 
over the field of moth-wing mosaics, which still showed the footprints of the 
golem. He sweated in embarrassment, the extent of his wicked willfulness now 
clear to him.</p>
<p>So passed the years. Howard Fair learned as much green magic as his brain could 
encompass.</p>
<p>He explored much of the green realm, finding so much beauty that he feared his 
brain might burst. He tasted, he heard, he felt, he sensed, and each one of his 
senses was a hundred times more discriminating than before. Nourishment came in 
a thousand different forms: from pink eggs which burst into a hot sweet gas, 
suffusing his entire body; from passing through a rain of stinging metal 
crystals; from simple contemplation of the proper symbol.</p>
<p>Homesickness for Earth waxed and waned. Sometimes it was insupportable and he 
was ready to forsake all he had learned and abandon his hopes for the future. At 
other times the magnificence of the green realm permeated him, and the thought 
of departure seemed like the threat of death itself.</p>
<p>By stages so gradual he never realized them he learned green magic.</p>
<p>But the new faculty gave him no pride: between his crude ineptitudes and the 
poetic elegance of the sprites remained a tremendous gap, and he felt his innate 
inferiority much more keenly than he ever had in his old state. Worse, his most 
earnest efforts failed to improve his technique, and sometimes, observing the 
singing joy of an improvised manifestation by one of the sprites, and 
contrasting it to his own labored constructions, he felt futility and shame.</p>
<p>The longer he remained in the green realm, the stronger grew the sense of his 
own maladroitness, and he began to long for the easy environment of Earth, where 
each of his acts would not shout aloud of vulgarity and crassness. At times he 
would watch the sprites (in the gossamer forms natural to them) at play among 
the pearl-petals, or twining like quick flashes of music through the forest of 
pink spirals. The contrast between their verve and his brutish fumbling could 
not be borne and he would turn away. His self-respect dwindled with each passing 
hour, and instead of pride in his learning, he felt a sullen ache for what he 
was not and could never become. The first few hundred years he worked with the 
enthusiasm of ignorance, for the next few he was buoyed by hope. During the last 
part of his time, only dogged obstinacy kept him plodding through what now he 
knew for infantile exercises.</p>
<p>In one terrible bittersweet spasm, he gave up. He found Jaadian weaving tinkling 
fragments of various magics into a warp of shining long splines. With grave 
courtesy, Jaadian gave Fair his attention, and Fair laboriously set forth his 
meaning.</p>
<p>Jaadian returned a message. "I recognize your discomfort, and extend my sympathy. 
It is best that you now return to your native home."</p>
<p>He put aside his weaving and conveyed Fair down through the requisite vortices. 
Along the way they passed Misthemar. No flicker of meaning was expressed or 
exchanged, but Howard Fair thought to feel a tinge of faintly malicious 
amusement.</p>
<p>Howard Fair sat in his apartment. His perceptions, augmented and sharpened by 
his sojourn in the green realm, took note of the surroundings. Only two hours 
before, by the clocks of Earth, he had found them both restful and stimulating; 
now they were neither. His books: superstition, spuriousness, earnest nonsense. 
His private journals and workbooks: a pathetic scrawl of infantilisms. Gravity 
tugged at his feet, held him rigid. The shoddy construction of the house, which 
heretofore he never had noticed, oppressed him. Everywhere he looked he saw 
slipshod disorder, primitive filth. The thought of the food he must now eat 
revolted him.</p>
<p>He went out on his little balcony which overlooked the street. The air was 
impregnated with organic smells. Across the street he could look into windows 
where his fellow humans lived in stupid squalor.</p>
<p>Fair smiled sadly. He had tried to prepare himself for these reactions, but now 
was surprised by their intensity. He returned into his apartment. He must 
accustom himself to the old environment. And after all there were compensations. 
The most desirable commodities of the world were now his to enjoy.</p>
<p>Howard Fair plunged into the enjoyment of these pleasures. He forced himself to 
drink quantities of expensive wines, brandies, liqueurs, even though they 
offended his palate. Hunger overcame his nausea, he forced himself to the 
consumption of what he thought of as fried animal tissue, the hypertrophied 
sexual organs of plants. He experimented with erotic sensations, but found that 
beautiful women no longer seemed different from the plain ones, and that he 
could barely steel himself to the untidy contacts. He bought libraries of 
erudite books, glanced through them with contempt. He tried to amuse himself 
with his old magics; they seemed ridiculous.</p>
<p>He forced himself to enjoy these pleasures for a month; then he fled the city 
and established a crystal bubble on a crag in the Andes. To nourish himself, he 
contrived a thick liquid, which, while by no means as exhilarating as the 
substances of the green realm, was innocent of organic contamination.</p>
<p>After a certain degree of improvisation and make-shift, he arranged his life to 
its minimum discomfort. The view was one of austere grandeur; not even the 
condors came to disturb him. He sat back to ponder the chain of events which had 
started with his discovery of Gerald McIntyre's workbook. He frowned. Gerald 
McIntyre? He jumped to his feet, looked far over the crags.</p>
<p>He found Gerald McIntyre at a wayside service station in the heart of the South 
Dakota prairie. McIntyre was sitting in an old wooden chair, tilted back against 
the peeling yellow paint of the service station, a straw hat shading his eyes 
from the sun.</p>
<p>He was a magnetically handsome man, blond of hair, brown of skin, with blue eyes 
whose gaze stung like the touch of icicles. His left thumb-nail glistened green.</p>
<p>Fair greeted him casually; the two men surveyed each other with wry curiosity.</p>
<p>"I see you have adapted yourself." said Howard Fair.</p>
<p>McIntyre shrugged. "As well as possible. I try to maintain a balance between 
solitude and the pressure of humanity." He looked into the bright blue sky where 
crows flapped and called. "For many years I lived in isolation. I began to 
detest the sound of my own breathing."</p>
<p>Along the highway came a glittering automobile, rococo as a hybrid goldfish. 
With the perceptions now available to them, Fair and McIntyre could see the 
driver to be red-faced and truculent, his companion a peevish woman in expensive 
clothes.</p>
<p>"There are other advantages to residence here," said McIntyre. "For instance, I 
am able to enrich the lives of passersby with trifles of novel adventure." He 
made a small gesture; two dozen crows swooped down and flew beside the 
automobile. They settled on the fenders, strutted back and forth along the hood, 
fouled the windshield.</p>
<p>The automobile squealed to a halt, the driver jumped out, put the birds to 
flight. He threw an ineffectual rock, waved his arms in outrage, returned to his 
car, proceeded.</p>
<p>"A paltry affair," said McIntyre with a sigh. "The truth of the matter is that I 
am bored." He pursed his mouth and blew forth three bright puffs of smoke: first 
red, then yellow, then blazing blue. "I have arrived at the estate of 
foolishness, as you can see."</p>
<p>Fair surveyed his great-uncle with a trace of uneasiness. McIntyre laughed. "No 
more pranks. I predict, however, that you will presently share my malaise."</p>
<p>"I share it already," said Fair. "Sometimes I wish I could abandon all my magic 
and return to my former innocence."</p>
<p>"I have toyed with the idea," McIntyre replied thoughtfully. "In fact I have 
made all the necessary arrangements. It is really a simple matter." He led Fair 
to a small room behind the station. Although the door was open, the interior 
showed a thick darkness.</p>
<p>McIntyre, standing well back, surveyed the darkness with a quizzical curl to his 
lip. "You need only enter. All your magic, all your recollections of the green 
realm will depart. You will be no wiser than the next man you meet. And with 
your knowledge will go your boredom, your melancholy, your dissatisfaction."</p>
<p>Fair contemplated the dark doorway. A single step would resolve his discomfort.</p>
<p>He glanced at McIntyre; the two surveyed each other with sardonic amusement. 
They returned to the front of the building.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I stand by the door and look into the darkness," said McIntyre. "Then 
I am reminded how dearly I cherish my boredom, and what a precious commodity is 
so much misery."</p>
<p>Fair made himself ready for departure. "I thank you for this new wisdom, which a 
hundred more years in the green realm would not have taught me. And now, for a 
time, at least, I go back to my crag in the Andes."</p>
<p>McIntyre tilted his chair against the wall of the service station. "And I, for a 
time, at least, will wait for the next passerby."</p>
<p>"Good-bye, then, Uncle Gerald."</p>
<p>"Good-bye, Howard."</p>
