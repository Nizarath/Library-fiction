<section>
<empty-line/><p>I'm a baitman. No one is born a baitman, except in a French novel where
everyone  is.  (In fact, I think that's the title, _We are All Bait_. Pfft!)
How I got that way is barely worth the telling and has nothing  to  do  with
neo-exes, but the days of the beast deserve a few words, so here they are.</p><empty-line/><p>The  Lowlands  of  Venus  lie  between  the thumb and forefinger of the
continent known as Hand. When you break  into  Cloud  Alley  it  swings  its
silverblack bowling ball toward you without a warning. You jump then, inside
that  firetailed  tenpin they ride you down in, but the straps keep you from
making a fool of yourself. You generally chuckle afterwards, but you  always
jump first.</p>
<p>Next,  you  study  Hand  to lay its illusion and the two middle fingers
become dozen-ringed archipelagoes  as  the  outers  resolve  into  greengray
peninsulas;  the  thumb is too short, and curls like the embryo tail of Cape
Horn.</p>
<p>You suck pure oxygen, sigh possibly, and begin the long topple back  to
the Lowlands.</p>
<p>There,  you  are  caught  like  an  infield fly at the Lifeline landing
area--so named because of its nearness to the great  delta  in  the  Eastern
Bay--located  between the first peninsula and "thumb." For a minute it seems
as if you're going to miss Lifeline and  wind  up  as  canned  seafood,  but
afterwards--shaking  off the metaphors--you descend to scorched concrete and
present your middle-sized  telephone  directory  of  authorizations  to  the
short,  fat man in the gray cap. The papers show that you are not subject to
mysterious inner rottings and etcetera. He then smiles  you  a  short,  fat,
gray  smile  and motions you toward the bus which hauls you to the Reception
Area. At the R.A. you spend three days proving that,  indeed,  you  are  not
subject to mysterious inner rottings and etcetera.</p>
<p>Boredom,  however,  is  another  rot.  When your three days are up, you
generally hit Lifeline hard, and it returns the compliment as  a  matter  of
reflex.  The effects of alcohol in variant atmospheres is a subject on which
the connoisseurs have written numerous volumes, so I will confine my remarks
to noting that a good binge is worthy of at least a week's  time  and  often
warrants a lifetime study.</p>
<p>I  had  been  a student of exceptional promise (strictly undergraduate)
for going on two years when the  _Bright  Water_  fell  through  our  marble
ceiling and poured its people like targets into the city.</p>
<p>Pause.  The  Worlds  Almanac  re Lifeline: "...Port city on the eastern
coast of Hand. Employees of the Agency for Non-terrestrial Research comprise
approximately 85%  of  its  100,000  population  (2010  Census).  Its  other
residents   are   primarily   personnel  maintained  by  several  industrial
corporations engaged  in  basic  research.  Independent  marine  biologists,
wealthy  fishing  enthusiasts,  and  waterfront  entrepreneurs  make  up the
remainder of its inhabitants."</p>
<p>I turned to Mike Dabis, a fellow entrepreneur,  and  commented  on  the
lousy state of basic research.</p>
<p>"Not if the mumbled truth be known."</p>
<p>He  paused  behind  his  glass  before  continuing  the slow swallowing
process calculated to  obtain  my  interest  and  a  few  oaths,  before  he
continued.</p>
<p>"Carl,"   he   finally   observed,   poker  playing,  "they're  shaping
Tensquare."</p>
<p>I could have hit him. I might have refilled  his  glass  with  sulfuric
acid  and  looked on with glee as his lips blackened and cracked. Instead, I
grunted a noncommittal.</p>
<p>"Who's fool enough to shell out fifty grand a day? ANR?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Jean Luharich," he said, "the girl with the violet contacts and  fifty
or sixty perfect teeth. I understand her eyes are really brown."</p>
<p>"Isn't she selling enough face cream these days?"</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<p>"Publicity  makes  the  wheels  go  'round.  Luharich Enterprise jumped
sixteen points when she picked up the Sun Trophy.  You  ever  play  golf  on
Mercury?"</p>
<p>I had, but I overlooked it and continued to press.</p>
<p>"So she's coming here with a blank check and a fishhook?"</p>
<p>"_Bright  Water_,  today,"  he  nodded. "Should be down by now. Lots of
cameras. She wants an Ikky, bad."</p>
<p>"Hmm," I hmmed. "How bad?"</p>
<p>"Sixty day contract. Tensquare. Indefinite  extension  clause.  Million
and a half deposit," he recited.</p>
<p>"You seem to know a lot about it."</p>
<p>"I'm  Personnel  Recruitment.  Luharich  Enterprises approached me last
month. It helps to drink in the right places.</p>
<p>"Or own them." He smirked, after a moment.</p>
<p>I looked away, sipping my bitter brew. After awhile I swallowed several
things and asked Mike what he expected to be asked, leaving myself open  for
his monthly temperance lecture.</p>
<p>"They  told me to try getting you," he mentioned. "When's the last time
you sailed?"</p>
<p>"Month and a half ago. The _Corning_."</p>
<p>"Small stuff," he snorted. "When have you been under, yourself?"</p>
<p>"It's been awhile."</p>
<p>"It's been over a year, hasn't it? That time you got cut by the  screw,
under the _Dolphin_?"</p>
<p>I turned to him.</p>
<p>"I  was  in the river last week, up at Angleford where the currents are
strong. I can still get around."</p>
<p>"Sober," he added.</p>
<p>"I'd stay that way," I said, "on a job like this."</p>
<p>A doubting nod.</p>
<p>"Straight union rates. Triple time for extraordinary circumstances," he
narrated. "Be at Hangar Sixteen with your gear, Friday morning, five hundred
hours. We push off Saturday, daybreak."</p>
<p>"You're sailing?"</p>
<p>"I'm sailing."</p>
<p>"How come?"</p>
<p>"Money."</p>
<p>"Ikky guano."</p>
<p>"The bar isn't doing so well and baby needs new minks."</p>
<p>"I repeat--"</p>
<p>"...And  I  want  to  get  away  from  baby,  renew  my  contract  with
basics--fresh air, exercise, make cash..."</p>
<p>"All right, sorry I asked."</p>
<p>I  poured him a drink, concentrating on H2SO4, but it didn't transmute.
Finally I got him soused and went out into  the  night  to  walk  and  think
things over.</p>
<p>Around  a  dozen  serious  attempts  to  land  _Ichthyform  Leviosaurus
Levianthus_, generally known as "Ikky", had been made  over  the  past  five
years.  When Ikky was first sighted, whaling techniques were employed. These
proved either fruitless or disastrous, and a new procedure was  inaugurated.
Tensquare  was  constructed  by a wealthy sportsman named Michael Jandt, who
blew his entire roll on the project.</p>
<p>After a year on the Eastern Ocean,  he  returned  to  file  bankruptcy.
Carlton  Davits,  a playboy fishing enthusiast, then purchased the huge raft
and laid a wake for Ikky's spawning grounds. On the nineteenth  day  out  he
had a strike and lost one hundred fifty bills' worth of untested gear, along
with one _Ichthyform Levianthus_. Twelve days later, using tripled lines, he
hooked,  narcotized,  and  began  to hoist the huge beast. It awakened then,
destroyed a control tower, killed six men, and worked general hell over five
square blocks of Tensquare. Carlton was left with partial hemiplegia  and  a
bankruptcy  suit  of  his  own.  He  faded  into  waterfront  atmosphere and
Tensquare changed hands four more times, with less spectacular  but  equally
expensive results.</p>
<p>Finally,  the  big raft, built only for one purpose was purchased at an
auction by ANR for "marine research." Lloyd's still won't insure it, and the
only marine research it has ever seen is an occasional rental at fifty bills
a day--to people anxious to tell Leviathan fish stories. I've been a baitman
on three of the voyages, and I've been close enough to count Ikky's fangs on
two occasions. I want one of them to show  my  grandchildren,  for  personal
reasons.</p>
<p>I faced the direction of the landing area and resolved a resolve.</p>
<p>"You  want  me  for local coloring, gal. It'll look nice on the feature
page and all that. But clear this--If anyone gets you an Ikky, it'll be  me.
I promise."</p>
<p>I  stood in the empty Square. The foggy towers of Lifeline shared their
mists.</p><empty-line/><p>Shoreline a couple eras ago, the western slope above Lifeline stretches
as far as forty miles inland in some places. Its angle of rising  is  not  a
great  one,  but it achieves an elevation of several thousand feet before it
meets the mountain range which separates us from the Highlands.  About  four
miles  inland and five hundred feet higher than Lifeline are set most of the
surface airstrips and privately owned hangars. Hangar Sixteen  houses  Cal's
Contract  Cab,  hop service, shore to ship. I do not like Cal, but he wasn't
around when I climbed from the bus and waved to a mechanic.</p>
<p>Two of the hoppers tugged at the concrete,  impatient  beneath  flywing
haloes.  The  one  on which Steve was working belched deep within its barrel
carburetor and shuttered spasmodically.</p>
<p>"Bellyache?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Yeah, gas pains and heartburn."</p>
<p>He twisted setscrews until it settled into an even keening, and  turned
to me.</p>
<p>"You're for out?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Tensquare. Cosmetics. Monsters. Stuff like that."</p>
<p>He blinked into the beacons and wiped his freckles. The temperature was
about twenty, but the big overhead spots served a double purpose.</p>
<p>"Luharich,"  he  muttered. "Then you _are_ the one. There's some people
want to see you."</p>
<p>"What about?"</p>
<p>"Cameras. Microphones. Stuff like that."</p>
<p>"I'd better stow my gear. Which one am I riding?"</p>
<p>He poked the screwdriver at the other hopper.</p>
<p>"That one. You're on video tape now, by the way. They wanted to get you
arriving."</p>
<p>He turned to the hangar, turned back.</p>
<p>"Say 'cheese.' They'll shoot the close-ups later."</p>
<p>I said something  other  than  "cheese."  They  must  have  been  using
telelens  and  been  able to read my lips, because that part of the tape was
never shown.</p>
<p>I threw my junk in the back, climbed into a passenger seat, and  lit  a
cigarette.  Five minutes later, Cal himself emerged from the office Quonset,
looking cold. He came over and pounded on the side of the hopper. He  jerked
a thumb back at the hangar.</p>
<p>"They want you in there!" he called through cupped hands. "Interview!"</p>
<p>"The  show's  over!"  I  yelled  back.  "Either  that,  or they can get
themselves another baitman!"</p>
<p>His rustbrown eyes became nailheads under blond brows and his  glare  a
spike  before  he jerked about and stalked off. I wondered how much they had
paid him to be able  to  squat  in  his  hangar  and  suck  juice  from  his
generator.</p>
<p>Enough, I guess, knowing Cal. I never liked the guy, anyway.</p><empty-line/><p>Venus at night is a field of sable waters. On the coasts, you can never
tell where  the  sea ends and the sky begins. Dawn is like dumping milk into
an inkwell. First, there are erratic curdles of white, then streamers. Shade
the bottle for a gray colloid, then watch it whiten a little more. All of  a
sudden you've got day. Then start heating the mixture.</p>
<p>I  had  to  shed my jacket as we flashed out over the bay. To our rear,
the skyline could have been under water for the way it waved and rippled  in
the  heatfall.  A  hopper  can accommodate four people (five, if you want to
bend Regs and underestimate weight), or three passengers with  the  sort  of
gear a baitman uses. I was the only fare, though, and the pilot was like his
machine.  He  hummed  and  made  no  unnecessary  noises.  Lifeline turned a
somersault and evaporated  in  the  rear  mirror  at  about  the  same  time
Tensquare  broke  the  fore-horizon. The pilot stopped humming and shook his
head.</p>
<p>I leaned forward. Feelings played flopdoodle in my guts. I  knew  every
bloody  inch  of  the  big  raft, but the feelings you once took for granted
change when their source is out of reach. Truthfully, I'd had my doubts  I'd
ever  board  the  hulk  again.  But  now,  now  I  could  almost  believe in
predestination. There it was!</p>
<p>A tensquare football field of a ship. A-powered.  Flat  as  a  pancake,
except  for the plastic blisters in the middle and the "Rooks" fore and aft,
port and starboard.</p>
<p>The Rook towers were named for their corner positions--and any two  can
work   together  to  hoist,  co-powering  the  graffles  between  them.  The
graffles--half gaff, half grapple--can raise enormous weights to near  water
level; their designer had only one thing in mind, though, which accounts for
the gaff half. At water level, the Slider has to implement elevation for six
to  eight  feet before the graffles are in a position to push upward, rather
than pulling.</p>
<p>The Slider, essentially, is a mobile room--a big box capable of  moving
in  any  of  Tensquare's  crisscross groovings and "anchoring" on the strike
side by means of a powerful electromagnetic bond. Its winches could hoist  a
battleship  the  necessary  distance, and the whole craft would tilt, rather
than the Slider come loose, if you want any idea of  the  strength  of  that
bond.</p>
<p>The  Slider  houses  a  section operated control indicator which is the
most sophisticated "reel" ever designed. Drawing broadcast  power  from  the
generator  beside  the center blister, it is connected by shortwave with the
sonar room, where the movements of the quarry are recorded and  repeated  to
the angler seated before the section control.</p>
<p>The  fisherman  might  play  his  "lines" for hours, days even, without
seeing any more than metal and an outline on the screen. Only when the beast
is graffled and the extensor shelf, located  twelve  feet  below  waterline,
slides  out  for  support  and begins to aid the winches, only then does the
fisherman see his catch rising before him like a  fallen  Seraph.  Then,  as
Davits  learned,  one looks into the Abyss itself and is required to act. He
didn't, and a hundred meters of unimaginable  tonnage,  undernarcotized  and
hurting,  broke  the  cables  of  the  winch,  snapped a graffle, and took a
half-minute walk across Tensquare.</p>
<p>We circled till the mechanical flag took notice and waved us  on  down.
We touched beside the personnel hatch and I jettisoned my gear and jumped to
the deck.</p>
<p>"Luck,"  called  the pilot as the door was sliding shut. Then he danced
into the air and the flag clicked blank.</p>
<p>I shouldered my stuff and went below.</p>
<p>Signing in with Malvern, the de facto captain, I learned that  most  of
the  others wouldn't arrive for a good eight hours. They had wanted me alone
at Cal's so they could  pattern  the  pub  footage  along  twentieth-century
cinema lines.</p>
<p>Open:  landing  strip,  dark.  One mechanic prodding a contrary hopper.
Stark-o-vision  shot  of  slow  bus  pulling  in.  Heavily  dressed  baitman
descends,  looks  about, limps across field. Close-up: he grins. Move in for
words: "Do you think this is the  time?  The  time  he  _will_  be  landed?"
Embarrassment,  taciturnity,  a  shrug. Dub something-"I see. And why do you
think Miss Luharich has a better chance  than  any  of  the  others?  Is  it
because  she's  better equipped? [Grin.] Because more is known now about the
creature's habits than when you were out before? Or is  it  because  of  her
will  to  win, to be a champion? Is it any one of these things, or is it all
of them?" Reply: "Yeah, all of them." "--Is that why you signed on with her?
Because your instincts say, 'This one will be it'?" Answer: "She pays  union
rates.  I couldn't rent that damned thing myself. And I want in." Erase. Dub
something else. Fade-out as he moves toward hopper, etcetera.</p>
<p>"Cheese," I said, or something  like  that,  and  took  a  walk  around
Tensquare, by myself.</p>
<p>I mounted each Rook, checking out the controls and the underwater video
eyes. Then I raised the main lift.</p>
<p>Malvern  had  no  objections to my testing things this way. In fact, he
encouraged it. We had sailed together before and our positions had even been
reversed upon a time. So I wasn't surprised when I stepped off the lift into
the Hopkins Locker and found him  waiting.  For  the  next  ten  minutes  we
inspected  the big room in silence, walking through its copper coil chambers
soon to be Arctic.</p>
<p>Finally, he slapped a wall.</p>
<p>"Well, will we find it?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"I'd like to, but I doubt it. I don't give two hoots  and  a  damn  who
gets  credit  for  the  catch,  so long as I have a part in it. But it won't
happen. That gal's an egomaniac. She'll want to operate the Slider, and  she
can't."</p>
<p>"You ever meet her?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"How long ago?"</p>
<p>"Four, five years."</p>
<p>"She was a kid then. How do you know what she can do now?"</p>
<p>"I  know.  She'll  have  learned every switch and reading by this time.
She'll be all up on theory. But do you remember one time we were together in
the starboard Rook, forward, when Ikky broke water like a porpoise?"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>He rubbed his emery chin.</p>
<p>"Maybe she can do it, Carl. She's raced torch ships and  she's  scubaed
in  bad  waters  back  home." He glanced in the direction of invisible Hand.
"And she's hunted in the Highlands. She might be wild enough  to  pull  that
horror into her lap without flinching.</p>
<p>"...For  Johns Hopkins to foot the bill and shell out seven figures for
the corpus," he added. "That's money, even to a Luharich."</p>
<p>I ducked through a hatchway.</p>
<p>"Maybe you're right, but she was a rich witch when I knew her.</p>
<p>"And she wasn't blonde," I added, meanly.</p>
<p>He yawned.</p>
<p>"Let's find breakfast."</p>
<p>We did that.</p><empty-line/><p>When I was young I thought that being  born  a  sea  creature  was  the
finest  choice  Nature could make for anyone. I grew up on the Pacific coast
and spent my summers on the Gulf or the Mediterranean. I lived months of  my
life  negotiating with coral, photographing trench dwellers, and playing tag
with dolphins. I fished everywhere there are fish, resenting the  fact  that
they  can  go  places I can't. When I grew older I wanted a bigger fish, and
there was nothing living that I knew of, excepting a Sequoia, that came  any
bigger than Ikky. That's part of it....</p>
<p>I  jammed a couple of extra rolls into a paper bag and filled a thermos
with coffee. Excusing myself, I left the gallery and  made  my  way  to  the
Slider  berth.  It  was just the way I remembered it. I threw a few switches
and the shortwave hummed.</p>
<p>"That you, Carl?"</p>
<p>"That's  right,  Mike.  Let  me  have  some  juice   down   here,   you
double-crossing rat."</p>
<p>He  thought it over, then I felt the hull vibrate as the generators cut
in. I poured my third cup of coffee and found a cigarette.</p>
<p>"So why am I a double-crossing rat this time?" came his voice again.</p>
<p>"You knew about the cameraman at Hangar Sixteen?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then you're a double-crossing rat. The last thing I want is publicity.
'He who fouled up so often before is ready to try it, nobly, once  more.'  I
can read it now."</p>
<p>"You're  wrong.  The  spotlight's  only  big  enough for one, and she's
prettier than you."</p>
<p>My next comment was cut off as I threw  the  elevator  switch  and  the
elephant  ears  flapped  above  me.  I  rose,  settling flush with the deck.
Retracting the lateral rail, I cut forward into  the  groove.  Amidships,  I
stopped  at  a juncture, dropped the lateral, and retracted the longitudinal
rail.</p>
<p>I slid starboard, midway between the Rooks, halted, and  threw  on  the
coupler.</p>
<p>I hadn't spilled a drop of coffee.</p>
<p>"Show me pictures."</p>
<p>The screen glowed. I adjusted and got outlines of the bottom.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>I threw a Status Blue switch and he matched it. The light went on.</p>
<p>The  winch  unlocked. I aimed out over the waters, extended an arm, and
fired a cast.</p>
<p>"Clean one," he commented.</p>
<p>"Status Red. Call strike." I threw a switch.</p>
<p>"Status Red."</p>
<p>The baitman would be on his way with this, to make the barbs tempting.</p>
<p>It's not exactly a fishhook. The cables bear hollow  tubes;  the  tubes
convey  enough  dope  for  an army of hopheads; Ikky takes the bait, dandled
before him by remote control, and the fisherman rams the barbs home.</p>
<p>My hands moved over the console, making the  necessary  adjustments.  I
checked  the narco-tank reading. Empty. Good, they hadn't been filled yet. I
thumbed the inject button.</p>
<p>"In the gullet," Mike murmured.</p>
<p>I released the cables. I played the beast  imagined.  I  let  him  run,
swinging the winch to simulate his sweep.</p>
<p>I  had  the  air  conditioner  on  and  my  shirt  off and it was still
uncomfortably hot, which is how I knew that morning had gone over into noon.
I was dimly aware of the arrivals and departures of the hoppers. Some of the
crew sat in the  "shade"  of  the  doors  I  had  left  open,  watching  the
operation.  I  didn't  see Jean arrive or I would have ended the session and
gotten below.</p>
<p>She broke my concentration by slamming the door hard  enough  to  shake
the bond.</p>
<p>"Mind telling me who authorized you to bring up the Slider?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No one," I replied. "I'll take it below now."</p>
<p>"Just move aside."</p>
<p>I  did,  and she took my seat. She was wearing brown slacks and a baggy
shirt and she had her hair pulled back in a  practical  manner.  Her  cheeks
were flushed, but not necessarily from the heat. She attacked the panel with
a nearly amusing intensity that I found disquieting.</p>
<p>"Status Blue," she snapped, breaking a violet fingernail on the toggle.</p>
<p>I  forced  a yawn and buttoned my shirt slowly. She threw a side glance
my way, checked the registers, and fired a cast.</p>
<p>I monitored the lead on the screen. She turned to me for a second.</p>
<p>"Status Red," she said levelly.</p>
<p>I nodded my agreement.</p>
<p>She worked the winch sideways to show she knew how. I didn't doubt  she
knew how and she didn't doubt that I didn't doubt, but then--</p>
<p>"In  case you're wondering," she said, "you're not going to be anywhere
near this thing. You were  hired  as  a  baitman,  remember?  Not  a  Slider
operator!  A  baitman!  Your  duties consist of swimming out and setting the
table for our friend the monster. It's dangerous, but  you're  getting  well
paid for it. Any questions?"</p>
<p>She squashed the Inject button and I rubbed my throat.</p>
<p>"Nope,"  I  smiled, "but I am qualified to run that thingamajigger--and
if you need me I'll be available, at union rates."</p>
<p>"Mister Davits," she said, "I don't want a loser operating this panel."</p>
<p>"Miss Luharich, there has never been a winner at this game."</p>
<p>She started reeling in the cable and broke the bond at the  same  time,
so  that  the  whole  Slider  shook  as the big yo-yo returned. We skidded a
couple of feet backward. She raised the laterals and we shot back along  the
groove.  Slowing,  she  transferred  rails and we jolted to a clanging halt,
then shot off at a right angle. The crew scrambled away from the hatch as we
skidded onto the elevator.</p>
<p>"In the future, Mister Davits, do not enter the  Slider  without  being
ordered," she told me.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I won't even step inside if I am ordered," I answered. "I
signed  on  as  a  baitman. Remember? If you want me in here, you'll have to
_ask_ me."</p>
<p>"That'll be the day," she smiled.</p>
<p>I agreed, as the doors closed above us.  We  dropped  the  subject  and
headed  in  our  different directions after the Slider came to a halt in its
berth. She did not say "good day," though, which I thought  showed  breeding
as well as determination, in reply to my chuckle.</p><empty-line/><p>Later  that  night  Mike and I stoked our pipes in Malvern's cabin. The
winds were shuffling waves, and a steady pattering of rain and hail overhead
turned the deck into a tin roof.</p>
<p>"Nasty," suggested Malvern.</p>
<p>I nodded. After two bourbons the room had become  a  familiar  woodcut,
with  its  mahogany furnishings (which I had transported from Earth long ago
on a whim) and the dark  walls,  the  seasoned  face  of  Malvern,  and  the
perpetually  puzzled expression of Dabis set between the big pools of shadow
that lay behind chairs and splashed in cornets, all cast by the  tiny  table
light and seen through a glass, brownly.</p>
<p>"Glad I'm in here."</p>
<p>"What's it like underneath on a night like this?"</p>
<p>I  puffed,  thinking of my light cutting through the insides of a black
diamond, shaken slightly. The meteor-dart of a  suddenly  illuminated  fish,
the  swaying  of  grotesque  ferns,  like  nebulae-shadow,  then green, then
gone--swam in a moment through my mind. I guess it's like a spaceship  would
feel,  if  a  spaceship  could  feel,  crossing  between  worlds--and quiet,
uncannily, preternaturally quiet; and peaceful as sleep.</p>
<p>"Dark," I said, "and not real choppy below a few fathoms."</p>
<p>"Another eight hours and we shove off," commented Mike.</p>
<p>"Ten, twelve days, we should be there," noted Malvern.</p>
<p>"What do you think Ikky's doing?"</p>
<p>"Sleeping on the bottom with Mrs. Ikky if he has any brains."</p>
<p>"He hasn't. I've seen ANR's skeletal extrapolation from the bones  that
have washed up--"</p>
<p>"Hasn't everyone?"</p>
<p>"...Fully  fleshed,  he'd  be  over  a hundred meters long. That right,
Carl?"</p>
<p>I agreed.</p>
<p>"...Not much of a brain box, though, for his bulk."</p>
<p>"Smart enough to stay out of our locker."</p>
<p>Chuckles, because nothing exists  but  this  room,  really.  The  world
outside is an empty, sleet drummed deck. We lean back and make clouds.</p>
<p>"Boss lady does not approve of unauthorized fly fishing."</p>
<p>"Boss lady can walk north till her hat floats."</p>
<p>"What did she say in there?"</p>
<p>"She told me that my place, with fish manure, is on the bottom."</p>
<p>"You don't Slide?"</p>
<p>"I bait."</p>
<p>"We'll see."</p>
<p>"That's  all  I  do. If she wants a Slideman she's going to have to ask
nicely."</p>
<p>"You think she'll have to?"</p>
<p>"I think she'll have to."</p>
<p>"And if she does, can you do it?"</p>
<p>"A fair question," I puffed. "I don't know the answer, though."</p>
<p>I'd incorporate my soul and trade forty percent of the  stock  for  the
answer.  I'd  give  a  couple  years  off  my life for the answer. But there
doesn't seem to be a lineup of supernatural takers, because  no  one  knows.
Supposing  when  we  get out there, luck being with us, we find ourselves an
Ikky? Supposing we succeed in baiting him and get lines on him.  What  then?
If  we get him shipside, will she hold on or crack up? What if she's made of
sterner stuff than Davits, who used to hunt sharks  with  poison-darted  air
pistols?  Supposing she lands him and Davits has to stand there like a video
extra.</p>
<p>Worse yet, supposing she asks for Davits and he still stands there like
a video extra or something else--say, some  yellowbellied  embodiment  named
Cringe?</p>
<p>It  was  when  I  got  him up above the eight-foot horizon of steel and
looked out at all that body, sloping on and on till it dropped out of  sight
like  a  green mountain range...And that head. Small for the body, but still
immense. Fat, craggy, with lidless roulettes that had  spun  black  and  red
since before my forefathers decided to try the New Continent. And swaying.</p>
<p>Fresh narco-tanks had been connected. It needed another shot, fast. But
I was paralyzed.</p>
<p>It had made a noise like God playing a Hammond organ...</p>
<p>_And looked at me!_</p>
<p>I  don't  know if seeing is even the same process in eyes like those. I
doubt it. Maybe I was just a  gray  blur  behind  a  black  rock,  with  the
plexi-reflected  sky  hurting  its  pupils.  But it fixed on me. Perhaps the
snake doesn't really paralyze the rabbit, perhaps it's just that rabbits are
cowards by constitution. But it began to struggle and I still couldn't move,
fascinated.</p>
<p>Fascinated by all that power,  by  those  eyes,  they  found  me  there
fifteen  minutes  later,  a  little broken about the head and shoulders, the
Inject still unpushed.</p>
<p>And I dream about those eyes. I want to face them once  more,  even  if
their finding takes forever. I've got to know if there's something inside me
that  sets  me  apart  from  a  rabbit,  from notched plates of reflexes and
instincts that always fall apart in exactly the same way whenever the</p>
<p>proper combination is spun.</p>
<p>Looking down, I noticed that  my  hand  was  shaking.  Glancing  up,  I
noticed that no one else was noticing.</p>
<p>I  finished  my drink and emptied my pipe. It was late and no songbirds
were singing.</p><empty-line/><p>I sat whittling, my legs hanging over the aft edge, the chips  spinning
down into the furrow of our wake. Three days out. No action.</p>
<p>"You!"</p>
<p>"Me?"</p>
<p>"You."</p>
<p>Hair  like  the  end  of the rainbow, eyes like nothing in nature, fine
teeth.</p>
<p>"Hello."</p>
<p>"There's a safety regulation against what you're doing, you know."</p>
<p>"I know. I've been worrying about it all morning."</p>
<p>A delicate curl climbed my knife then drifted out behind us. It settled
into the foam and was plowed under. I watched her reflection  in  my  blade,
taking a secret pleasure in its distortion.</p>
<p>"Are you baiting me?" she finally asked.</p>
<p>I heard her laugh then, and turned, knowing it had been intentional.</p>
<p>"What, me?"</p>
<p>"I could push you off from here, very easily."</p>
<p>"I'd make it back."</p>
<p>"Would you push me off, then--some dark night, perhaps?"</p>
<p>"They're  all dark, Miss Luharich. No, I'd rather make you a gift of my
carving."</p>
<p>She seated herself beside me then, and I couldn't help but  notice  the
dimples  in  her  knees. She wore white shorts and a halter and still had an
offworld tan to her which was awfully appealing. I almost felt a  twinge  of
guilt at having planned the whole scene, but my right hand still blocked her
view of the wooden animal.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll bite. What have you got for me?"</p>
<p>"Just a second. It's almost finished."</p>
<p>Solemnly,  I passed her the little wooden jackass I had been carving. I
felt a little sorry and slightly jackass-ish myself, but  I  had  to  follow
through. I always do. The mouth was split into a braying grin. The ears were
upright.</p>
<p>She didn't smile and she didn't frown. She just studied it.</p>
<p>"It's  very  good,"  she  finally  said,  "like most things you do--and
appropriate, perhaps."</p>
<p>"Give it to me." I extended a palm.</p>
<p>She handed it back and I tossed it out over the water.  It  missed  the
white water and bobbed for awhile like a pigmy seahorse.</p>
<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>
<p>"It was a poor joke. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Maybe  you  are  right,  though.  Perhaps  this time I've bitten off a
little too much."</p>
<p>I snorted.</p>
<p>"Then why not do something safer, like another race?"</p>
<p>She shook her end of the rainbow.</p>
<p>"No. It has to be an Ikky."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Why did you want one so badly that you threw away a fortune?"</p>
<p>"Many reasons," I said. "An unfrocked analyst who  held  black  therapy
sessions in his basement once told me, 'Mister Davits, you need to reinforce
the  image  of  your  masculinity  by  catching one of every kind of fish in
existence.' Fish are a very ancient masculinity symbol, you know. So  I  set
out to do it. I have one more to go.
--Why do you want to reinforce _your_ masculinity?"</p>
<p>"I  don't,"  she said. "I don't want to reinforce anything but Luharich
Enterprises. My chief statistician once said, 'Miss Luharich, sell  all  the
cold  cream  and face powder in the System and you'll be a happy girl. Rich,
too.' And he was right. I am the proof. I can look  the  way  I  do  and  do
anything, and I sell most of the lipstick and face powder in the System--but
I have to be _able_ to do anything."</p>
<p>"You do look cool and efficient," I observed.</p>
<p>"I don't feel cool," she said, rising. "Let's go for a swim."</p>
<p>"May I point out that we're making pretty good time?"</p>
<p>"If  you want to indicate the obvious, you may. You said you could make
it back to the ship, unassisted. Change your mind?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then get us two scuba outfits and I'll race you under Tensquare.</p>
<p>"I'll win, too," she added.</p>
<p>I stood and looked down at her, because  that  usually  makes  me  feel
superior to women.</p>
<p>"Daughter  of  Lir,  eyes  of  Picasso," I said, "you've got yourself a
race. Meet me at the forward Rook, starboard, in ten minutes."</p>
<p>"Ten minutes," she agreed.</p>
<p>And ten minutes it was. From the center blister to the Rook took  maybe
two  of  them,  with the load I was carrying. My sandals grew very hot and I
was glad to shuck them for flippers when I reached the comparative  cool  of
the corner.</p>
<p>We  slid  into  harnesses and adjusted our gear. She had changed into a
trim one-piece green job that made me shade my eyes and look away, then look
back again.</p>
<p>I fastened a rope ladder and kicked it over the side. Then I pounded on
the wall of the Rook.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"You talk to the port Rook, aft?" I called.</p>
<p>"They're all set up," came the answer. "There's ladders  and  draglines
all over that end."</p>
<p>"You  sure you want to do this?" asked the sunburnt little gink who was
her publicity man, Anderson yclept.</p>
<p>He sat beside the Rook in  a  deckchair,  sipping  lemonade  through  a
straw.</p>
<p>"It  might  be dangerous," he observed, sunken-mouthed. (His teeth were
beside him, in another glass.)</p>
<p>"That's right," she  smiled.  "It  _will_  be  dangerous.  Not  overly,
though."</p>
<p>"Then  why  don't  you let me get some pictures? We'd have them back to
Lifeline in an hour. They'd be in New York by tonight. Good copy."</p>
<p>"No," she said, and turned away from both of us.</p>
<p>"Here, keep these for me."</p>
<p>She passed him a box full of her unseeing, and when she turned back  to
me they were the same brown that I remembered.</p>
<p>"Ready?"</p>
<p>"No,"  I said, tautly. "Listen carefully, Jean. If you're going to play
this game there are a few rules. First,"  I  counted,  "we're  going  to  be
directly  beneath  the  hull, so we have to start low and keep moving. If we
bump the bottom, we could rupture an air tank..."</p>
<p>She began to protest that any moron knew that and I cut her down.</p>
<p>"Second," I went on, "there won't be much light, so  we'll  stay  close
together, and we will _both_ carry torches."</p>
<p>Her wet eyes flashed.</p>
<p>"I dragged you out of Govino without--"</p>
<p>Then she stopped and turned away. She picked up a lamp.</p>
<p>"Okay. Torches. Sorry."</p>
<p>"...And  watch  out  for  the  drive-screws,"  I finished. "There'll be
strong currents for at least fifty meters behind them."</p>
<p>She wiped her eyes and adjusted the mask.</p>
<p>"All right, let's go."</p>
<p>We went.</p>
<p>She led the way, at my insistence. The  surface  layer  was  pleasantly
warm. At two fathoms the water was bracing; at five it was nice and cold. At
eight we let go the swinging stairway and struck out. Tensquare sped forward
and  we  raced  in  the  opposite  direction,  tattooing  the hull yellow at
ten-second intervals.</p>
<p>The hull stayed where it belonged, but we raced on  like  two  darkside
satellites.  Periodically,  I tickled her frog feet with my light and traced
her antennae of bubbles. About a five meter lead was fine; I'd beat  her  in
the home stretch, but I couldn't let her drop behind yet.</p>
<p>Beneath us, black. Immense. Deep. The Mindanao of Venus, where eternity
might  eventually  pass  the  dead  to a rest in cities of unnamed fishes. I
twisted my head away and touched the hull with a feeler of light; it told me
we were about a quarter of the way along.</p>
<p>I increased my beat to match her stepped-up stroke,  and  narrowed  the
distance  which  she  had suddenly opened by a couple of meters. She sped up
again and I did, too. I spotted her with my beam.</p>
<p>She turned and it caught on her mask. I never knew whether  she'd  been
smiling.  Probably.  She  raised two fingers in a V-for-Victory and then cut
ahead at full speed.</p>
<p>I should have known. I should have felt it coming. It was just  a  race
to her, something else to win. Damn the torpedos!</p>
<p>So  I  leaned into it, hard. I don't shake in the water. Or, if I do it
doesn't matter and I don't notice it. I began to close the gap again.</p>
<p>She looked back, sped on, looked back. Each  time  she  looked  it  was
nearer, until I'd narrowed it down to the original five meters.</p>
<p>Then she hit the jatoes.</p>
<p>That's  what  I  had been fearing. We were about half-way under and she
shouldn't have done it. The powerful jets of  compressed  air  could  easily
rocket  her upward into the hull, or tear something loose if she allowed her
body to twist. Their main use is in  tearing  free  from  marine  plants  or
fighting  bad currents. I had wanted them along as a safety measure, because
of the big suck-and-pull windmills behind.</p>
<p>She shot ahead like a meteorite, and I could feel a  sudden  tingle  of
perspiration leaping to meet and mix with the churning waters.</p>
<p>I  swept  ahead,  not  wanting  to  use  my  own guns, and she tripled,
quadrupled the margin.</p>
<p>The jets died and  she  was  still  on  course.  Okay,  I  was  an  old
fuddyduddy. She _could_ have messed up and headed toward the top.</p>
<p>I plowed the sea and began to gather back my yardage, a foot at a time.
I wouldn't  be  able  to  catch her or beat her now, but I'd be on the ropes
before she hit deck.</p>
<p>Then the spinning magnets began their insistence and  she  wavered.  It
was  an  awfully  powerful drag, even at this distance. The call of the meat
grinder.</p>
<p>I'd been scratched up by one once, under the _Dolphin_, a fishing  boat
of the middle-class. I _had_ been drinking, but it was also a rough day, and
the  thing had been turned on prematurely. Fortunately, it was turned off in
time, also, and a tendon-stapler made everything good as new, except in  the
log,  where it only mentioned that I'd been drinking. Nothing about it being
off-hours when I had the right to do as I damn well pleased.</p>
<p>She had slowed to half her speed, but she was still moving  cross-wise,
toward the port, aft corner. I began to feel the pull myself and had to slow
down.  She'd  made  it  past the main one, but she seemed too far back. It's
hard to gauge distances under water, but each red beat of time told me I was
right. She was out of danger from the main one, but the smaller port  screw,
located about eighty meters in, was no longer a threat but a certainty.</p>
<p>She  had  turned  and  was  pulling  away  from  it  now. Twenty meters
separated us. She was standing still. Fifteen.</p>
<p>Slowly, she began a backward drifting. I  hit  my  jatoes,  aiming  two
meters behind her and about twenty back of the blades.</p>
<p>Straightline!  Thankgod!  Catching,  softbelly,  leadpipe  on  shoulder
SWIMLIKEHELL! maskcracked, not broke though AND UP!</p>
<p>We caught a line and I remember brandy.</p><empty-line/><p>Into the cradle endlessly rocking I spit, pacing.  Insomnia tonight
and left shoulder sore again, so let it rain on me--they can cure
rheumatism.  Stupid as hell.  What I said.  In blankets and shivering.
She: "Carl, I can't say it."  Me: "Then call it square for that night
in Govino, Miss Luharich.  Huh?"  She: nothing.  Me: "Any more of that
brandy?"  She: "Give me another, too."  Me: sounds of sipping.  It had
only lasted three months.  No alimony.  Many $ on both sides.  Not
sure whether they were happy or not.  Wine-dark Aegean.  Good fishing.
Maybe he should have spent more time on shore.  Or perhaps she
shouldn't have.  Good swimmer, though.  Dragged him all the way to
Vido to wring out his lungs.  Corfu should have brought them closer.
Didn't.  I think that mental cruelty was a trout.  He wanted to go to
Canada.  She: "Go to hell if you want!"  He: "Will you go along?"
She: "No."  But she did, anyhow.  Many hells.  Expensive.  He lost a
monster or two.  She inherited a couple.  Lot of lightning tonight.
Stupid as hell.  Civility's the coffin of a conned soul.  By whom?
--Sounds like a bloody neo-ex....But I hate you, Anderson, with your
glass full of teeth and her new eyes....Can't keep this pipe lit, keep
sucking tobacco.  Spit again!</p><empty-line/><p>Seven days out and the scope showed Ikky.</p>
<p>Bells jangled, feet pounded, and some optimist set  the  thermostat  in
the  Hopkins. Malvern wanted me to sit it out, but I slipped into my harness
and waited for whatever came. The bruise looked worse than it  felt.  I  had
exercised every day and the shoulder hadn't stiffened on me.</p>
<p>A  thousand meters ahead and thirty fathoms deep, it tunneled our path.
Nothing showed on the surface.</p>
<p>"Will we chase him?" asked an excited crewman.</p>
<p>"Not unless she feels like using money for fuel." I shrugged.</p>
<p>Soon the scope was clear, and it stayed that way. We remained on  alert
and held our course.</p>
<p>I hadn't said over a dozen words to my boss since the last time we went
drowning together, so I decided to raise the score.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon," I approached. "What's new?"</p>
<p>"He's  going north-northeast. We'll have to let this one go. A few more
days and we can afford some chasing. Not yet."</p>
<p>_Sleek head..._</p>
<p>I nodded. "No telling where this one's headed."</p>
<p>"How's your shoulder?"</p>
<p>"All right. How about you?"</p>
<p>_Daughter of Lir..._</p>
<p>"Fine. By the way, you're down for a nice bonus."</p>
<p>_Eyes of perdition!_</p>
<p>"Don't mention it," I told her back.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, and appropriately, a storm shattered.  (I  prefer
"shattered"  to  "broke."  It  gives a more accurate idea of the behavior of
tropical storms on Venus and saves a lot of words.) Remember that inkwell  I
mentioned earlier? Now take it between thumb and forefinger and hit its side
with a hammer. Watch yourself! Don't get splashed or cut--</p>
<p>Dry,  then drenched. The sky one million bright fractures as the hammer
falls. And sounds of breaking.</p>
<p>"Everyone below?" suggested the loudspeakers to the  already  scurrying
crew.</p>
<p>Where was I? Who do you think was doing the loudspeaking?</p>
<p>Everything  loose  went overboard when the water got to walking, but by
then no people were loose. The Slider was the first thing below decks.  Then
the big lifts lowered their shacks.</p>
<p>I  had  hit it for the nearest Rook with a yell the moment I recognized
the pre-brightening of the holocaust. From there I cut in the  speakers  and
spent half a minute coaching the track team.</p>
<p>Minor  injuries  had occurred, Mike told me over the radio, but nothing
serious. I, however, was marooned for the duration. The Rooks  do  not  lead
anywhere;  they're set too far out over the hull to provide entry downwards,
what with the extensor shelves below.</p>
<p>So I undressed myself of the tanks  which  I  had  worn  for  the  past
several  hours,  crossed  my flippers on the table, and leaned back to watch
the hurricane. The top was black as the bottom and we were in  between,  and
somewhat  illuminated  because  of  all  that  flat, shiny space. The waters
didn't rain down--they just sort of got together and dropped.</p>
<p>The Rooks were secure enough--they'd  weathered  any  number  of  these
onslaughts--it's  just  that their positions gave them a greater arc of rise
and descent when Tensquare makes like the rocker of a very nervous  grandma.
I had used the belts form my rig to strap myself into the bolted-down chair,
and  I  removed  several  years in purgatory from the soul of whoever left a
pack of cigarettes in the table drawer.</p>
<p>I watched the water make teepees and  mountains  and  hands  and  trees
until I started seeing faces and people. So I called Mike.</p>
<p>"What are you doing down there?"</p>
<p>"Wondering what you're doing up there," he replied. "What's it like?"</p>
<p>"You're from the Midwest, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Get bad storms out there?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes."</p>
<p>"Try  to  think  of  the  worst  one you were ever in. Got a slide rule
handy?"</p>
<p>"Right here."</p>
<p>"Then put a one under it, imagine a zero or two  following  after,  and
multiply the thing out."</p>
<p>"I can't imagine the zeros."</p>
<p>"Then retain the multiplicand--that's all you can do."</p>
<p>"So what are you doing up there?"</p>
<p>"I've strapped myself in the chair. I'm watching things roll around the
floor right now."</p>
<p>I looked up and out again. I saw one darker shadow in the forest.</p>
<p>"Are you praying or swearing?"</p>
<p>"Damned  if  I know. But if this were the Slider--if only this were the
Slider!"</p>
<p>"_He's out there?_"</p>
<p>I nodded, forgetting that he couldn't see me.</p>
<p>Big, as I remembered him. He'd only broken surface for a  few  moments,
to  look  around.  _There is no power on Earth that can be compared with him
who was made to fear no one._ I dropped my cigarette. It  was  the  same  as
before. Paralysis and an unborn scream.</p>
<p>"You all right, Carl?"</p>
<p>He  had  looked  at me again. Or seemed to. Perhaps that mindless brute
had been waiting half a millennium to ruin the life of a member of the  most
highly developed species in business....</p>
<p>"You okay?"</p>
<p>...Or  perhaps it had been ruined already, long before their encounter,
and theirs was just a meeting of beasts, the  stronger  bumping  the  weaker
aside, body to psyche....</p>
<p>"Carl, dammit! Say something!"</p>
<p>He  broke  again,  this  time  nearer.  Did you ever see the trunk of a
tornado? It seems like something alive, moving  around  in  all  that  dark.
Nothing  has  a  right to be so big, so strong, and moving. It's a sickening
sensation.</p>
<p>"Please answer me."</p>
<p>He was gone and did not come back that day. I finally made a couple  of
wisecracks at Mike, but I held my next cigarette in my right hand.</p><empty-line/><p>The  next  seventy  or eighty thousand waves broke by with a monotonous
similarity. The five days that held them were also without distinction.  The
morning of the thirteenth day out, though, our luck began to rise. The bells
broke our coffee-drenched lethargy into small pieces, and we dashed from the
gallery without hearing what might have been Mike's finest punchline.</p>
<p>"Aft!" cried someone. "Five hundred meters!"</p>
<p>I stripped to my trunks and started buckling. My stuff is always within
grabbing distance.</p>
<p>I   flipflopped  across  the  deck,  girding  myself  with  a  deflated
squiggler.</p>
<p>"Five hundred meters, twenty fathoms!" boomed the speakers.</p>
<p>The big traps banged upward and the Slider grew  to  its  full  height,
m'lady  at  the console. It rattled past me and took root ahead. Its one arm
rose and lengthened.</p>
<p>I breasted the Slider as the speakers called, "Four-eight, twenty!"</p>
<p>"Status Red!"</p>
<p>A belch like an emerging champagne cork and the line  arced  high  over
the waters.</p>
<p>"Four-eight,  twenty!"  it  repeated, all Malvern and static. "Baitman,
attend!"</p>
<p>I adjusted my mask and hand-over-handed it down the  side.  Then  warm,
then cool, then away.</p>
<p>Green,  vast,  down.  Fast.  This  is  the  place where I am equal to a
squiggler. If something big decides a baitman looks tastier than  what  he's
carrying, then irony colors his title as well as the water about it.</p>
<p>I  caught sight of the drifting cables and followed them down. Green to
dark green to black. It had been a long cast, too long.  I'd  never  had  to
follow one this far down before. I didn't want to switch on my torch.</p>
<p>But I had to.</p>
<p>Bad!  I  still had a long way to go. I clenched my teeth and stuffed my
imagination into a straightjacket.</p>
<p>Finally the line came to an end.</p>
<p>I wrapped one arm about it and unfastened the squiggler. I attached it,
working as fast as I could, and plugged in the little insulated  connections
which are the reason it can't be fired with the line. Ikky could break them,
but by then it wouldn't matter.</p>
<p>My  mechanical eel hooked up, I pulled its section plugs and watched it
grow. I had been dragged deeper during this operation, which  took  about  a
minute and a half. I was near--too near--to where I never wanted to be.</p>
<p>Loathe as I had been to turn on my light, I was suddenly afraid to turn
it off.  Panic  gripped  me  and  I  seized  the  cable with both hands. The
squiggler began to glow, pinkly. It started to twist. It was twice as big as
I am and doubtless twice as attractive  to  pink  squiggler-eaters.  I  told
myself  this  until  I believed it, then I switched off my light and started
up.</p>
<p>If I bumped into something enormous and steel-hided my heart had orders
to stop beating immediately and release me--to dart fitfully  forever  along
Acheron, and gibbering.</p>
<p>Ungibbering, I made it to green water and fled back to the nest.</p>
<p>As  soon  as they hauled me aboard I made my mask a necklace, shaded my
eyes, and monitored for surface turbulence. My first  question,  of  course,
was "Where is he?"</p>
<p>"Nowhere,"  said  a  crewman;  "we  lost him right after you went over.
Can't pick him up on the scope now. Musta dived."</p>
<p>"Too bad."</p>
<p>The squiggler stayed down, enjoying its bath. My job ended for the time
being, I headed back to warm my coffee with rum.</p>
<p>From behind me, a whisper: "Could you laugh like that afterwards?"</p>
<p>Perceptive Answer: "Depends on what he's laughing at."</p>
<p>Still chuckling, I made  my  way  into  the  center  blister  with  two
cupfuls.</p>
<p>"Still hell and gone?"</p>
<p>Mike  nodded.  His  big  hands  were shaking, and mine were steady as a
surgeon's when I set down the cups.</p>
<p>He jumped as I shrugged off the tanks and looked for a bench.</p>
<p>"Don't drip on that panel! You want to kill yourself and blow expensive
fuses?"</p>
<p>I toweled down, then settled down to watching the unfilled eye  on  the
wall. I yawned happily; my shoulder seemed good as new.</p>
<p>The  little  box  that  people talk through wanted to say something, so
Mike lifted the switch and told it to go ahead.</p>
<p>"Is Carl there, Mister Dabis?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Then let me talk to him."</p>
<p>Mike motioned and I moved.</p>
<p>"Talk," I said.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, thanks. Shouldn't I be?"</p>
<p>"That was a long swim. I--I guess I overshot my cast."</p>
<p>"I'm happy," I said. "More triple-time for me. I  really  clean  up  on
that hazardous duty clause."</p>
<p>"I'll  be  more  careful next time," she apologized. "I guess I was too
eager. Sorry--" Something happened to the sentence, so she ended  it  there,
leaving me with half a bagful of replies I'd been saving.</p>
<p>I  lifted the cigarette from behind Mike's ear and got a light from the
one in the ashtray.</p>
<p>"Carl, she was being nice," he said, after turning to study the panels.</p>
<p>"I know," I told him. "I wasn't."</p>
<p>"I mean, she's an awfully pretty  kid,  pleasant.  Headstrong  and  all
that. But what's she done to you?"</p>
<p>"Lately?" I asked.</p>
<p>He looked at me, then dropped his eyes to his cup.</p>
<p>"I know it's none of my bus--" he began.</p>
<p>"Cream and sugar?"</p><empty-line/><p>Ikky didn't return that day, or that night. We picked up some Dixieland
out of Lifeline and let the muskrat ramble while Jean had her supper sent to
the Slider.  Later  she  had a bunk assembled inside. I piped in "Deep Water
Blues" when it came over the air and waited for her to call up and  cuss  us
out. She didn't though, so I decided she was sleeping.</p>
<p>Then  I  got  Mike  interested  in  a  game of chess that went on until
daylight. It limited conversation to several "checks," one "checkmate,"  and
a  "damn!"  Since he's a poor loser it also effectively sabotaged subsequent
talk, which was fine with me. I had a steak and fried potatoes for breakfast
and went to bed.</p>
<p>Ten hours later someone shook me awake and  I  propped  myself  on  one
elbow, refusing to open my eyes.</p>
<p>"Whassamadder?"</p>
<p>"I'm  sorry  to get you up," said one of the younger crewmen, "but Miss
Luharich wants you to disconnect the squiggler so we can move on."</p>
<p>I knuckled open one eye, still deciding whether I should be amused.</p>
<p>"Have it hauled to the side. Anyone can disconnect it."</p>
<p>"It's at the side now, sir. But she said it's in your contract and we'd
better do things right."</p>
<p>"That's very considerate of her. I'm  sure  my  Local  appreciates  her
remembering."</p>
<p>"Uh,  she  also  said  to  tell you to change your trunks and comb your
hair, and shave, too. Mister Anderson's going to film it."</p>
<p>"Okay. Run along; tell her I'm on my  way--and  ask  if  she  has  some
toenail polish I can borrow."</p>
<p>I'll  save  on  details.  It took three minutes in all, and I played it
properly, even pardoning myself when I slipped and  bumped  into  Anderson's
white  tropicals  with  the  wet  squiggler.  He smiled, brushed it off; she
smiled, even though Luharich Complectacolor  couldn't  completely  mask  the
dark  circles under her eyes; and I smiled, waving to all our fans out there
in  videoland.  --Remember,  Mrs.  Universe,  you,  too,  can  look  like  a
monster-catcher. Just use Luharich face cream.</p>
<p>I went below and made myself a tuna sandwich, with mayonnaise.</p><empty-line/><p>Two  days like icebergs--bleak, blank, half-melting, all frigid, mainly
out of sight, and definitely a threat to peace of mind--drifted by and  were
good  to  put  behind.  I  experienced some old guilt feelings and had a few
disturbing dreams. Then I called Lifeline and checked my bank balance.</p>
<p>"Going shopping?" asked Mike, who had put the call through for me.</p>
<p>"Going home," I answered.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I'm out of the baiting business after this one, Mike. The  Devil  with
Ikky!  The  Devil  with  Venus  and Luharich Enterprises! And the Devil with
you!"</p>
<p>Up eyebrows.</p>
<p>"What brought that on?"</p>
<p>"I waited over a year for this job. Now that I'm here, I've decided the
whole thing stinks."</p>
<p>"You knew what it was when you signed on. No matter  what  else  you're
doing, you're selling face cream when you work for face cream sellers."</p>
<p>"Oh,  that's  not  what's  biting  me.  I  admit  the  commercial angle
irritates me, but Tensquare has always been a publicity spot, ever since the
first time it sailed."</p>
<p>"What, then?"</p>
<p>"Five or six things, all added up. The main one being that I don't care
any more. Once it meant more to me than anything else to hook that  critter,
and  now it doesn't. I went broke on what started out as a lark and I wanted
blood for what it had cost me. Now I realize that maybe I had it coming. I'm
beginning to feel sorry for Ikky."</p>
<p>"And you don't want him now?"</p>
<p>"I'll take him if he comes peacefully, but I don't feel  like  sticking
out my neck to make him crawl into the Hopkins."</p>
<p>"I'm  inclined  to  think it's one of the four or five other things you
said you added."</p>
<p>"Such as?"</p>
<p>He scrutinized the ceiling.</p>
<p>I growled.</p>
<p>"Okay, but I won't say it, not just  to  make  you  happy  you  guessed
right."</p>
<p>He, smirking: "That look she wears isn't just for Ikky."</p>
<p>"No  good,  no  good." I shook my head. "We're both fission chambers by
nature. You can't have jets on both ends of the  rocket  and  expect  to  go
anywhere--what's in the middle just gets smashed."</p>
<p>"That's how it _was_. None of my business, of course--"</p>
<p>"Say that again and you'll say it without teeth."</p>
<p>"Any day, big man"--he looked up--"any place..."</p>
<p>"So go ahead. Get it said!"</p>
<p>"She  doesn't care about that bloody reptile, she came here to drag you
back where you belong. You're not the baitman this trip."</p>
<p>"Five years is too long."</p>
<p>"There must be something under that cruddy hide of  yours  that  people
like," he muttered, "or I wouldn't be talking like this. Maybe you remind us
humans  of some really ugly dog we felt sorry for when we were kids. Anyhow,
someone wants to take you home and raise you--also, something about  beggars
not getting menus."</p>
<p>"Buddy,"  I  chuckled,  "do  you  know  what I'm going to do when I hit
Lifeline?"</p>
<p>"I can guess."</p>
<p>"You're wrong. I'm torching it to Mars, and then I'll cruise back home,
first class. Venus bankruptcy provisions  do  not  apply  to  Martian  trust
funds,  and I've still got a wad tucked away where moth and corruption enter
not. I'm going to pick up a big old mansion on the Gulf and if  you're  ever
looking for a job you can stop around and open bottles for me."</p>
<p>"You are a yellowbellied fink," he commented.</p>
<p>"Okay," I admitted, "but it's her I'm thinking of, too."</p>
<p>"I've heard the stories about you both," he said. "So you're a heel and
a goofoff  and she's a bitch. That's called compatibility these days. I dare
you, baitman, try keeping something you catch."</p>
<p>I turned.</p>
<p>"If you ever want that job, look me up."</p>
<p>I closed the door quietly behind me and left him sitting there  waiting
for it to slam.</p><empty-line/><p>The  day  of the beast dawned like any other. Two days after my gutless
flight from empty waters I went down to rebait. Nothing on the scope. I  was
just making things ready for the routine attempt.</p>
<p>I  hollered  a  "good  morning" from outside the Slider and received an
answer from inside before I pushed off. I had reappraised Mike's words, sans
sound, sans fury, and  while  I  did  not  approve  of  their  sentiment  or
significance, I had opted for civility anyhow.</p>
<p>So  down,  under,  and  away.  I  followed  a  decent  cast  about  two
hundred-ninety meters out. The snaking cables burned black to my left and  I
paced  their  undulations  from  the  yellowgreen  down  into  the darkness.
Soundless lay the wet night, and I bent my way through it like  a  cock-eyed
comet, bright tail before.</p>
<p>I  caught  the  line, slick and smooth, and began baiting. An icy world
swept by me then, ankles to head. It was a draft, as if someone had opened a
big door beneath me. I wasn't drifting forwards that fast either.</p>
<p>Which meant that something might be moving up, something big enough  to
displace  a  lot of water. I still didn't think it was Ikky. A freak current
of some sort, but not Ikky. Ha!</p>
<p>I had finished attaching the leads and pulled the  first  plug  when  a
big, rugged, black island grew beneath me....</p>
<p>I flicked the beam downward. His mouth was opened.</p>
<p>I was rabbit.</p>
<p>Waves  of  the  death-fear passed downward. My stomach imploded. I grew
dizzy.</p>
<p>Only one thing, and one thing only. Left to do. I managed it,  finally.
I pulled the rest of the plugs.</p>
<p>I could count the scaly articulations ridging his eyes by then.</p>
<p>The squiggler grew, pinked into phosphorescence...squiggled.</p>
<p>Then my lamp. I had to kill it, leaving just the bait before him.</p>
<p>One glance back as I jammed the jatoes to life.</p>
<p>He  was so near that the squiggler reflected on his teeth, in his eyes.
Four meters, and I kissed his lambent jowls with two jets of backwash  as  I
soared.  Then  I didn't know whether he was following or had halted. I began
to black out as I waited to be eaten.</p>
<p>The jatoes died and I kicked weakly.</p>
<p>Too fast, I felt a cramp coming  on.  One  flick  of  the  beam,  cried
rabbit. One second, to know...</p>
<p>Or end things up, I answered. No, rabbit, we don't dart before hunters.
Stay dark.</p>
<p>Green waters, finally, to yellowgreen, then top.</p>
<p>Doubling,  I  beat  off  toward Tensquare. The waves from the explosion
behind pushed me on ahead. The world closed in, and a screamed "He's alive!"
in the distance.</p>
<p>A giant shadow and a shock wave. The line was alive, too. Happy Fishing
Grounds. Maybe I did something wrong....</p>
<p>Somewhere Hand was clenched. What's bait?</p><empty-line/><p>A few million years. I remember starting out as a  one-celled  organism
and  painfully  becoming  an amphibian, then an air-breather. From somewhere
high in the treetops I heard a voice.</p>
<p>"He's coming around."</p>
<p>I evolved back into homosapience, then a step further into a hangover.</p>
<p>"Don't try to get up yet."</p>
<p>"Have we got him?" I slurred.</p>
<p>"Still fighting, but he's  hooked.  We  thought  he  took  you  for  an
appetizer."</p>
<p>"So did I."</p>
<p>"Breath some of this and shut up."</p>
<p>A funnel over my face. Good. Lift your cups and drink....</p>
<p>"He  was  awfully  deep. Below scope range. We didn't catch him till he
started up. Too late, then."</p>
<p>I began to yawn.</p>
<p>"We'll get you inside now."</p>
<p>I managed to uncase my ankle knife.</p>
<p>"Try it and you'll be minus a thumb."</p>
<p>"You need rest."</p>
<p>"Then bring me a couple more blankets. I'm staying."</p>
<p>I fell back and closed my eyes.</p><empty-line/><p>Someone was shaking me. Gloom and cold. Spotlights bled yellow  on  the
deck.  I  was  in  a  jury-rigged  bunk,  bulked against the center blister.
Swaddled in wool, I still shivered.</p>
<p>"It's been eleven hours. You're not going to see anything now."</p>
<p>I tasted blood.</p>
<p>"Drink this."</p>
<p>Water. I had a remark but I couldn't mouth it.</p>
<p>"Don't ask me how I feel," I croaked. "I  know  that  comes  next,  but
don't ask me. Okay?"</p>
<p>"Okay. Want to go below now?"</p>
<p>"No. Just get me my jacket."</p>
<p>"Right here."</p>
<p>"What's he doing?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. He's deep, he's doped but he's staying down."</p>
<p>"How long since last time he showed?"</p>
<p>"Two hours, about."</p>
<p>"Jean?"</p>
<p>"She  won't  let anyone in the Slider. Listen, Mike says to come on in.
He's right behind you in the blister."</p>
<p>I sat up and turned around. Mike was watching. He gestured; I  gestured
back.</p>
<p>I  swung my feet over the edge and took a couple of deep breaths. Pains
in my stomach. I got to my feet and made it into the blister.</p>
<p>"Howza gut?" queried Mike.</p>
<p>I checked the scope. No Ikky. Too deep.</p>
<p>"You buying?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, coffee."</p>
<p>"Not coffee."</p>
<p>"You're ill. Also, coffee is all that's allowed in here."</p>
<p>"Coffee is a brownish liquid that burns your stomach. You have some  in
the bottom drawer."</p>
<p>"No cups. You'll have to use a glass."</p>
<p>"Tough."</p>
<p>He poured.</p>
<p>"You do that well. Been practicing for that job?"</p>
<p>"What job?"</p>
<p>"The one I offered you--"</p>
<p>A blot on the scope!</p>
<p>"Rising, ma'am! Rising!" he yelled into the box.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mike. I've got it in here," she crackled.</p>
<p>"Jean!"</p>
<p>"Shut up! She's busy!"</p>
<p>"Was that Carl?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," I called. "Talk later," and I cut it.</p>
<p>Why did I do that?</p>
<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>
<p>I didn't know.</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>Damned echoes! I got up and walked outside.</p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing.</p>
<p>Something?</p>
<p>Tensquare actually rocked! He must have turned when he saw the hull and
started  downward  again.  White  water  to my left, and boiling. An endless
spaghetti of cable roared hotly into the belly of the deep.</p>
<p>I stood awhile, then turned and went back inside.</p>
<p>Two hours sick. Four, and better.</p>
<p>"The dope's getting to him."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"What about Miss Luharich?"</p>
<p>"What about her?"</p>
<p>"She must be half dead."</p>
<p>"Probably."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do about it?"</p>
<p>"She signed the contract for this. She knew what might happen. It did."</p>
<p>"I think you could land him."</p>
<p>"So do I."</p>
<p>"So does she."</p>
<p>"Then let her ask me."</p>
<p>Ikky was drifting lethargically, at thirty fathoms.</p>
<p>I took another walk and happened to pass behind the Slider. She  wasn't
looking my way.</p>
<p>"Carl, come in here!"</p>
<p>Eyes of Picasso, that's what, and a conspiracy to make me Slide...</p>
<p>"Is that an order?"</p>
<p>"Yes--No! Please."</p>
<p>I dashed inside and monitored. He was rising.</p>
<p>"Push or pull?"</p>
<p>I slammed the "wind" and he came like a kitten.</p>
<p>"Make up your own mind now."</p>
<p>He balked at ten fathoms.</p>
<p>"Play him?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>She wound him upwards--five fathoms, four...</p>
<p>She hit the extensors at two, and the caught him. Then the graffles.</p>
<p>Cries without and a heat of lightning of flashbulbs.</p>
<p>The crew saw Ikky.</p>
<p>He began to struggle. She kept the cables tight, raised the graffles.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Another two feet and the graffles began pulsing.</p>
<p>Screams and fast footfalls.</p>
<p>Giant  beanstalk  in the wind, his neck, waving. The green hills of his
shoulders grew.</p>
<p>"He's big, Carl!" she cried.</p>
<p>And he grew, and grew, and grew uneasy...</p>
<p>"_Now!_"</p>
<p>He looked down.</p>
<p>He looked down, as the god of our most  ancient  ancestors  might  have
looked  down.  Fear,  shame, and mocking laughter rang in my head. Her head,
too?</p>
<p>"Now!"</p>
<p>She looked up at the nascent earthquake.</p>
<p>"I can't!"</p>
<p>It was going to be so damnably simple this time,  now  the  rabbit  had
died. I reached out.</p>
<p>I stopped.</p>
<p>"Push it yourself."</p>
<p>"I can't. You do it. Land him, Carl!"</p>
<p>"No. If I do, you'll wonder for the rest of your life whether you could
have.  You'll  throw  away  your  soul finding out. I know you will, because
we're alike, and I did it that way. Find out now!"</p>
<p>She stared.</p>
<p>I gripped her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Could be that's me out there," I offered. "I am a green sea serpent, a
hateful, monstrous beast, and out to destroy you. I am answerable to no one.
Push the Inject."</p>
<p>Her hand moved to the button, jerked back.</p>
<p>"Now!"</p>
<p>She pushed it.</p>
<p>I lowered her still form to the floor and finished things up with Ikky.</p>
<p>It was a good seven hours before I awakened to the steady,  sea-chewing
grind of Tensquare's blades.</p>
<p>"You're sick," commented Mike.</p>
<p>"How's Jean?"</p>
<p>"The same."</p>
<p>"Where's the beast?"</p>
<p>"Here."</p>
<p>"Good." I rolled over. "...Didn't get away this time."</p>
<p>So  that's the way it was. No one is born a baitman, I don't think, but
the rings of Saturn sing epithalamium the sea-beast's dower.</p><empty-line/>

<section>

<p>BORN  OF  MAN  and  woman,  in accordance with Catform Y7 requirements,
Coldworld Class (modified per Alyonal), 3.2-E, G.M.I. option, Jarry Dark was
not suited for existence anywhere in the universe which had guaranteed him a
niche. This was either a blessing or a curse, depending on how you looked at
it.</p>
<p>So look at it however you would, here is the story:</p>
<p>It is likely that his parents could have afforded the temperature
control unit, but not much more than that.  (Jarry required a
temperature of at least -50 C. to be comfortable.)</p>
<p>It is unlikely that  his  parents  could  have  provided  for  the  air
pressure control and gas mixture equipment required to maintain his life.</p>
<p>Nothing  could  be  done  in the way of 3.2-E grav-simulation, so daily
medication and physiotherapy were required. It is unlikely that his  parents
could have provided for this.</p>
<p>The much-maligned option took care of him, however. It safe-guarded his
health.  It  provided for his education. It assured his economic welfare and
physical well-being.</p>
<p>It might be argued that Jarry Dark  would  not  have  been  a  homeless
Coldworld Catform (modified per Alyonal) had it not been for General Mining,
Incorporated,  which  had held the option. But then it must be borne in mind
that no one could have foreseen the nova which destroyed Alyonal.</p>
<p>When his parents had presented themselves at the Public Health  Planned
Parenthood  Center  and  requested  advice and medication pending offspring,
they had  been  informed  as  to  the  available  worlds  and  the  bodyform
requirements  for  them.  They had selected Alyonal, which had recently been
purchased by General Mining for purposes of  mineral  exploitation.  Wisely,
they  had  elected the option; that is to say, they had signed a contract on
behalf of their anticipated offspring, who would be eminently  qualified  to
inhabit  that  world,  agreeing that he would work as an employee of General
Mining until he achieved his majority, at which time he  would  be  free  to
depart  and  seek  employment  wherever  he might choose (though his choices
would admittedly be limited). In return for this guarantee,  General  Mining
agreed to assure his health, education and continuing welfare for so long as
he remained in their employ.</p>
<p>When  Alyonal  caught  fire  and  went  away,  those Coldworld Catforms
covered by the option who were scattered about the crowded galaxy  were,  by
virtue of the agreement, wards of General Mining.</p>
<p>This  is  why  Jarry  grew  up in a hermetically sealed room containing
temperature and atmosphere controls,  and  why  he  received  a  first-class
closed circuit education, along with his physiotherapy and medicine. This is
also  why Jarry bore some resemblance to a large gray ocelot without a tail,
had webbing between his fingers and  could  not  go  outside  to  watch  the
traffic  unless  he  wore  a  pressurized  refrigeration suit and took extra
medication.</p>
<p>All over the swarming galaxy, people took the advice of  Public  Health
Planned  Parenthood  Centers,  and  many  others  had  chosen as had Jarry's
parents. Twenty-eight thousand, five hundred sixty-six of them, to be exact.
In any group of over twenty-eight thousand five  hundred  sixty,  there  are
bound  to  be  a  few  talented individuals. Jarry was one of them. He had a
knack for making money.  Most  of  his  General  Mining  pension  check  was
invested  in  well-chosen  stocks of a speculative nature. (In fact, after a
time he came to own considerable stock in General Mining.)</p>
<p>When the man from the Galactic Civil Liberties Union had  come  around,
expressing  concern  over the pre-birth contracts involved in the option and
explaining that the Alyonal Catforms would make a good test case (especially
since Jarry's parents lived within jurisdiction of the 877th Circuit,  where
they  would  be assured favorable courtroom atmosphere), Jarry's parents had
demurred, for fear of jeopardizing the General  Mining  pension.  Later  on,
Jarry himself dismissed the notion also. A favorable decision could not make
him  an  E-world  Normform,  and  what else mattered? He was not vindictive.
Also, he owned considerable stock in G.M. by then.</p>
<p>He loafed in his methane tank and  purred,  which  meant  that  he  was
thinking.  He  operated  his  cryo-computer as he purred and thought. He was
computing the total net worth of all the Catforms in the recently  organized
December Club.</p>
<p>He  stopped  purring  and  considered a sub-total, stretched, shook his
head slowly. Then he returned to his calculations.</p>
<p>When he had finished, he dictated a message into  his  speech-tube,  to
Sanza Barati, President of December and his betrothed:</p>
<p>"Dearest Sanza--the funds available, as I have suspected, leave much to
be desired.  All  the  more  reason  to begin immediately. Kindly submit the
proposal to the business  committee,  outline  my  qualifications  and  seek
immediate  endorsement.  I've finished drafting the general statement to the
membership. (Copy attached.) From these figures, it  will  take  me  between
five  and  ten years, if at least eighty percent of the membership backs me.
So push hard, beloved. I'd like to meet you someday, in a  place  where  the
sky  is  purple.  Yours, always, Jarry Dark, Treasurer. P.S. I'm pleased you
were pleased with the ring."</p>
<p>Two  years  later,  Jarry  had  doubled  the  net  worth  of  December,
Incorporated.</p>
<p>A year and a half after that, he had doubled it again.</p>
<p>When  he  received  the  following letter from Sanza, he leapt onto his
trampoline, bounded into the air, landed upon his feet at the  opposite  end
of his quarters, returned to his viewer and replayed it:</p>
<p>Dear Jarry,</p>
<p>Attached are specifications and prices for five more</p>
<p>worlds. The research staff likes the last one. So do I.</p>
<p>What do you think? Alyonal II? If so, how about the price?</p>
<p>When could we afford that much? The staff also says that an</p>
<p>hundred Worldchange units could alter it to what we want in</p>
<p>5-6 centuries. Will forward costs of this machinery shortly.</p>
<p>Come live with me and be my love, in a place where there</p>
<p>are no walls....</p>
<p>Sanza</p>
<p>"One  year,"  he  replied, "and I'll buy you a world! Hurry up with the
costs of the machinery and transport...." When  the  figures  arrived  Jarry
wept icy tears. One hundred machines, capable of altering the environment of
a  world,  plus twenty-eight thousand coldsleep bunkers, plus transportation
costs for the machinery and his people, plus...Too  high!  He  did  a  rapid
calculation.</p>
<p>He spoke into the speech-tube:</p>
<p>"...Fifteen  additional  years is too long to wait, Pussycat. Have them
figure the time-span if we were to purchase only twenty  Worldchange  units.
Love and kisses, Jarry."</p>
<p>During  the days which followed, he stalked above his chamber, erect at
first, then on all fours as his mood deepened.</p>
<p>"Approximately three thousand years," came the reply. "May your coat be
ever shiny--Sanza."</p>
<p>"Let's put it to a vote, Greeneyes," he said.</p>
<p>Quick, a world in 300 words or less! Picture this...</p>
<p>One land mass, really, containing  three  black  and  brackish  looking
seas; gray plains and yellow plains and skies the color of dry sand; shallow
forests  with  trees  like mushrooms which have been swabbed with iodine; no
mountains, just hills brown, yellow, white, lavender; green birds with wings
like parachutes, bills like sickles, feathers like oak leaves, an inside-out
umbrella behind; six very distant moons,  like  spots  before  the  eyes  in
daytime; grass like mustard in the moister valleys; mists like white fire on
windless  mornings,  albino serpents when the air's astir; radiating chasms,
like fractures in frosted windowpanes; hidden caverns, like chains  of  dark
bubbles; seventeen known dangerous predators, ranging from one to six meters
in  length,  excessively  furred  and fanged; sudden hailstorms, like hurled
hammerheads from a clear  sky;  an  icecap  like  a  blue  beret  at  either
flattened  pole;  nervous  bipeds  a  meter  and  a half in height, short on
cerebrum,  which  wander  the  shallow  forests  and  prey  upon  the  giant
caterpillar's  larva,  as well as the giant caterpillar, the green bird, the
blind burrower, and the offal-eating  murkbeast;  seventeen  mighty  rivers;
clouds  like  pregnant  purple  cows, which quickly cross the land to lie-in
beyond the visible east; stands of windblasted  stones  like  frozen  music;
nights  like  soot, to obscure the lesser stars; valleys which flow like the
torsos of women or instruments  of  music;  perpetual  frost  in  places  of
shadow;  sounds  in  the  morning like the cracking of ice, the trembling of
tin, the snapping of steel strands...</p>
<p>They knew they would turn it to heaven.</p>
<p>The vanguard arrived, decked out in refrigeration suits, installed  ten
Worldchange  units in either hemisphere, began setting up cold-sleep bunkers
in several of the larger caverns.</p>
<p>Then came the members of December down from the sand-colored sky.</p>
<p>They came and they saw, decided it  was  almost  heaven,  then  entered
their  caverns  and  slept.  Over  twenty-eight  thousand Coldworld Catforms
(modified per Alyonal) came into their own world to sleep for  a  season  in
silence  the sleep of ice and of stone, to inherit the new Alyonal. There is
no dreaming in that sleep. But had there been, their dreams might have  been
as the thoughts of those yet awake.</p>
<p>"It is bitter, Sanza."</p>
<p>"Yes, but only for a time--"</p>
<p>"...To  have  each  other and our own world, and still to go forth like
divers at the bottom of the sea. To have to crawl when you want to leap..."</p>
<p>"It is only for a short time, Jarry, as the sense will reckon it."</p>
<p>"But it is really three thousand years! An ice age will come to pass as
we doze. Our former worlds will change so that we would not know  them  were
we to go back for a visit--and none will remember us."</p>
<p>"Visit what? Our former cells? Let the rest of the worlds go by! Let us
be forgotten  in  the  lands of our birth! We are a people apart and we have
found our home. What else matters?"</p>
<p>"True...It will be but a few years, and we shall  stand  our  tours  of
wakefulness and watching together."</p>
<p>"When is the first?"</p>
<p>"Two and a half centuries from now--three months of wakefulness."</p>
<p>"What will it be like then?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Less warm..."</p>
<p>"Then let us return and sleep. Tomorrow will be a better day."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh! See the green bird! It drifts like a dream..."</p>
<p>When they awakened that first time, they stayed within the Worldchange
installation at the place called Deadland.  The world was already
colder and the edges of the sky were tinted with pink.  The metal
walls of the great installation were black and rimed with frost.  The
atmosphere was still lethal and the temperature far too high.  They
remained within their special chambers for most of the time, venturing
outside mainly to make necessary tests and to inspect the structure of
their home.</p>
<p>Deadland...Rocks and sand. No trees, no marks of life at all.</p>
<p>The time of terrible winds was still upon the land, as the world fought
back against  the  fields  of  the  machines. At night, great clouds of real
estate smoothed and sculpted  the  stands  of  stone,  and  when  the  winds
departed  the  desert would shimmer as if fresh-painted and the stones would
stand like flames within the morning and its singing. After the sun came  up
into  the  sky  and hung there for a time, the winds would begin again and a
dun-colored fog would curtain the day.  When  the  morning  winds  departed,
Jarry  and Sanza would stare out across the Deadland through the east window
of the installation, for that was  their  favorite--the  one  on  the  third
floor--where the stone that looked like a gnarly Normform waved to them, and
they  would lie upon the green couch they had moved up from the first floor,
and would sometimes make love as they listened for the winds to rise  again,
or  Sanza  would  sing and Jarry would write in the log or read back through
it, the scribblings of friends and unknowns through the centuries, and  they
would purr often but never laugh, because they did not know how.</p>
<p>One  morning,  as  they watched, they saw one of the biped creatures of
the iodine forests moving across the land. It  fell  several  times,  picked
itself up, fell once more, lay still.</p>
<p>"What is it doing this far from its home?" asked Sanza.</p>
<p>"Dying," said Jarry. "Let's go outside."</p>
<p>They  crossed  a  catwalk,  descended  to the first floor, donned their
protective suits and departed the installation.</p>
<p>The creature had risen to its feet and was staggering  once  again.  It
was covered with a reddish down, had dark eyes and a long, wide nose, lacked
a true forehead. It had four brief digits, clawed, upon each hand and foot.</p>
<p>When  it  saw  them  emerge  from  the Worldchange unit, it stopped and
stared at them. Then it fell.</p>
<p>They moved to its side and studied it where it lay.</p>
<p>It continued to stare at them, its dark eyes  wide,  as  it  lay  there
shivering.</p>
<p>"It will die if we leave it here," said Sanza.</p>
<p>"...And it will die if we take it inside," said Jarry.</p>
<p>It raised a forelimb toward them, let it fall again. Its eyes narrowed,
then closed.</p>
<p>Jarry reached out and touched it with the toe of his boot. There was no
response.</p>
<p>"It's dead," he said.</p>
<p>"What will we do?"</p>
<p>"Leave it here. The sands will cover it."</p>
<p>They  returned  to the installation, and Jarry entered the event in the
log.</p>
<p>During their last month of duty, Sanza asked him, "Will everything  die
here  but  us? The green birds and the big eaters of flesh? The funny little
trees and the hairy caterpillar?"</p>
<p>"I  hope  not,"  said  Jarry.  "I've  been  reading  back  through  the
biologists'  notes. I think life might adapt. Once it gets a start anywhere,
it'll do anything it can  to  keep  going.  It's  probably  better  for  the
creatures  of this planet we could afford only twenty Worldchangers That way
they have three millennia to grow more hair and learn to breathe our air and
drink our water. With a hundred units we might have wiped them out  and  had
to  import  coldworld  creatures  or breed them. This way, the ones who live
here might be able to make it."</p>
<p>"It's funny," she said, "but the thought just occurred to me that we're
doing here what was done to us. They made us for Alyonal, and a nova took it
away. These creatures came to life in this place, and we're taking it  away.
We're  turning  all  of  life on this planet into what we were on our former
worlds--misfits."</p>
<p>"The difference, however, is that we are taking our time," said  Jarry,
"and giving them a chance to get used to the new conditions."</p>
<p>"Still,  I  feel that all that--outside there"--she gestured toward the
window--"is what this world is becoming: one big Deadland."</p>
<p>"Deadland was here before we came. We haven't created any new deserts."</p>
<p>"All the animals are moving south. The trees are dying. When  they  get
as  far  south  as  they can go and still the temperature drops, and the air
continues to harm their lungs--then it will be all over for them."</p>
<p>"By then  they  might  have  adapted.  The  trees  are  spreading,  are
developing thicker barks. Life will make it."</p>
<p>"I wonder...."</p>
<p>"Would you prefer to sleep until it's all over?"</p>
<p>"No; I want to be by your side, always."</p>
<p>"Then  you must reconcile yourself to the fact that something is always
hurt by any change. If you do this, you will not be hurt yourself."</p>
<p>Then they listened for the winds to rise.</p>
<p>Three days later, in the still of sundown, between the winds of day and
the winds of night, she called him to the window. He climbed  to  the  third
floor  and moved to her side. Her breasts were rose in the sundown light and
the places beneath them silver and  dark.  The  fur  of  her  shoulders  and
haunches  was  like  an  aura  of smoke. Her face was expressionless and her
wide, green eyes were not turned toward him.</p>
<p>He looked out.</p>
<p>The first big flakes were falling, blue, through the pink  light.  They
drifted  past  the stone and gnarly Normform; some stuck in the thick quartz
windowpane; they fell upon  the  desert  and  lay  there  like  blossoms  of
cyanide; they swirled as more of them came down and were caught by the first
faint  puffs  of  the  terrible winds. Dark clouds had mustered overhead and
from them, now, great cables and nets of  blue  descended.  Now  the  flakes
flashed  past  the  window  like  butterflies,  and  the outline of Deadland
flickered on and off. The pink vanished and there was only  blue,  blue  and
darkening  blue, as the first great sigh of evening came into their ears and
the billows suddenly moved sidewise rather than downwards,  becoming  indigo
as they raced by.</p>
<p>"The  machine  is  never silent," Jarry wrote. "Sometimes I fancy I can
hear voices in its constant humming, its occasional growling,  its  crackles
of  power.  I  am  alone  here  at the Deadland station. Five centuries have
passed since our arrival. I thought it better to let Sanza  sleep  out  this
tour of duty, lest the prospect be too bleak. (It is.) She will doubtless be
angry.  As  I  lay  half-awake  this  morning, I thought I heard my parents'
voices in the next room. No words. Just the sounds of their voices as I used
to hear them over my old intercom. They must be dead  by  now,  despite  all
geriatrics.  I  wonder  if  they thought of me much after I left? I couldn't
even shake my father's hand without the gauntlet, or kiss my mother goodbye.
It is strange, the feeling, to be this alone, with only  the  throb  of  the
machinery  about  me  as  it  rearranges  the  molecules  of the atmosphere,
refrigerates the world, here in the middle  of  the  blue  place.  Deadland.
This,  despite  the  fact  that  I grew up in a steel cave. I call the other
nineteen stations every afternoon. I am afraid I am becoming something of  a
nuisance. I won't call them tomorrow, or perhaps the next day.</p>
<p>"I went outside without my refrig-pack this morning, for a few moments.
It is  still  deadly  hot. I gulped a mouthful of air and choked. Our day is
still far off. But I can notice the difference from the last  time  I  tried
it,  two and a half hundred years ago. I wonder what it will be like when we
have finished? --And I, an economist! What will my function be  in  our  new
Alyonal? Whatever, so long as Sanza is happy....</p>
<p>"The  Worldchanger stutters and groans. All the land is blue for so far
as I can see. The stones still stand, but their shapes are changed from what
they were. The sky is entirely pink now, and it becomes almost maroon in the
morning and the evening. I guess it's really a wine-color,  but  I've  never
seen  wine,  so  I  can't  say for certain. The trees have not died. They've
grown hardier. Their barks are thicker, their leaves darker and larger. They
grow much taller now, I've been told. There are no trees in Deadland.</p>
<p>"The caterpillars still live. They seem much larger, I understand,  but
it  is  actually  because they have become woollier than they used to be. It
seems that  most  of  the  animals  have  heavier  pelts  these  days.  Some
apparently  have  taken  to  hibernating.  A  strange  thing:  Station Seven
reported that they had thought the bipeds were growing heavier coats.  There
seem  to be quite a few of them in that area, and they often see them off in
the distance. They looked  to  be  shaggier.  Closer  observation,  however,
revealed that some of them were either carrying or were wrapped in the skins
of  dead  animals!  Could  it be that they are more intelligent than we have
given them credit for? This hardly seems possible, since  they  were  tested
quite  thoroughly  by  the Bio Team before we set the machines in operation.
Yes, it is very strange.</p>
<p>"The winds are still severe. Occasionally, they  darken  the  sky  with
ash.  There  has been considerable vulcanism southwest of here. Station Four
was relocated because of this. I hear Sanza singing now, within  the  sounds
of  the  machine. I will let her be awakened the next time. Things should be
more settled by then. No, that is not true. It is selfishness.  I  want  her
here  beside  me.  I  feel  as  if I were the only living thing in the whole
world. The voices on the radio are ghosts. The clock ticks  loudly  and  the
silences between the ticks are filled with the humming of the machine, which
is  a  kind of silence, too, because it is constant. Sometimes I think it is
not there; I listen for it, I strain my ears, and  I  do  not  know  whether
there  is  a humming or not. I check the indicators then, and they assure me
that the machine is functioning. Or perhaps there is  something  wrong  with
the indicators. But they seem to be all right. No. It is me. And the blue of
Deadland  is  a  kind  of  visual silence. In the morning even the rocks are
covered with blue frost. Is it beautiful  or  ugly?  There  is  no  response
within  me.  It  is a part of the great silence, that's all. Perhaps I shall
become a mystic. Perhaps I shall develop occult powers or achieve  something
bright  and  liberating  as  I  sit here at the center of the great silence.
Perhaps I shall see visions. Already I hear  voices.  Are  there  ghosts  in
Deadland?  No,  there  was never anything here to be ghosted. Except perhaps
for the little biped. Why did it cross Deadland, I wonder? Why did  it  head
for  the center of destruction rather than away, as its fellows did? I shall
never know. Unless perhaps I have a vision. I think it is time  to  suit  up
and  take  a  walk. The polar icecaps are heavier. The glaciation has begun.
Soon, soon things will be better. Soon the  silence  will  end,  I  hope.  I
wonder,  though,  whether  silence  is  not the true state of affairs in the
universe, our little noises serving only to accentuate it, like a  speck  of
black  on  a  field  of  blue.  Everything  was  once silence and will be so
again--is now, perhaps. Will I ever hear real sounds, or only sounds out  of
the silence? Sanza is singing again. I wish I could wake her up now, to walk
with me, out there. It is beginning to snow."</p>
<p>Jarry awakened again on the eve of the millennium.</p>
<p>Sanza  smiled  and took his hand in hers and stoked it, as he explained
why he had let her sleep, as he apologized.</p>
<p>"Of course I'm not angry," she said, "considering I did the same  thing
to you last cycle."</p>
<p>Jarry stared up at her and felt the understanding begin.</p>
<p>"I'll  not  do  it  again,"  she  said,  "and  I know you couldn't. The
aloneness is almost unbearable."</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>
<p>"They warmed us both alive last time. I came around first and told them
to put you back to sleep. I was angry then, when I found out  what  you  had
done. But I got over it quickly, so often did I wish you were there."</p>
<p>"We will stay together," said Jarry.</p>
<p>"Yes, always."</p>
<p>They  took  a  flier  from  the  cavern  of  sleep  to  the Worldchange
installation at Deadland, where they relieved the other attendants and moved
the new couch up to the third floor.</p>
<p>The air of Deadland, while sultry, could  now  be  breathed  for  short
periods of time, though a headache invariably followed such experiments. The
heat  was  still oppressive. The rock, once like an old Normform waving, had
lost its distinctive outline. The winds were no longer so severe.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, they found some animal tracks which seemed to belong
to one of the larger predators.  This  cheered  Sanza,  but  another,  later
occurrence produced only puzzlement.</p>
<p>One morning they went forth to walk in Deadland.</p>
<p>Less  than  a hundred paces from the installation, they came upon three
of the giant caterpillars, dead. They were stiff, as though dried out rather
than frozen, and they were surrounded by rows of markings within  the  snow.
The  footprints  which  led  to  the  scene  and  away from it were rough of
outline, obscure.</p>
<p>"What does it mean?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know, but I think we had better photograph this," said Jarry.</p>
<p>They did. When Jarry spoke to Station Eleven that afternoon, he learned
that similar occurrences had occasionally been noted by attendants of  other
installations. These were not too frequent, however.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," said Sanza.</p>
<p>"I don't want to," said Jarry.</p>
<p>It  did  not  happen  again during their tour of duty. Jarry entered it
into the  log  and  wrote  a  report.  Then  they  abandoned  themselves  to
lovemaking,  monitoring, and occasionally nights of drunkenness. Two hundred
years previously, a biochemist had devoted his tour of duty to experimenting
with compounds which would produce the same reactions  in  Catforms  as  the
legendary  whiskey  did in Normforms. He had been successful, had spent four
weeks on a colossal binge, neglected his duty and been relieved of  it,  was
then  retired  to  his  coldbunk  for the balance of the Wait. His basically
simple formula  had  circulated,  however,  and  Jarry  and  Sanza  found  a
well-stocked  bar  in the storeroom and a hand-written manual explaining its
use and a variety of drinks which might be compounded.  The  author  of  the
document had expressed the hope that each tour of attendance might result in
the  discovery of a new mixture, so that when he returned for his next cycle
the manual would have grown to a size proportionate to his desire. Jarry and
Sanza worked at  it  conscientiously,  and  satisfied  the  request  with  a
Snowflower Punch which warmed their bellies and made their purring turn into
giggles,  so  that  they  discovered  laughter  also.  They  celebrated  the
millennium with an entire bowl of it, and Sanza insisted on calling all  the
other  installations  and  giving  them  the  formula,  right  then,  on the
graveyard watch, so that everyone could share in  their  joy.  It  is  quite
possible  that  everyone  did, for the recipe was well-received. And always,
even after that bowl was but a memory, they kept the laughter. Thus are  the
first simple lines of tradition sometimes sketched.</p>
<p>"The green birds are dying," said Sanza, putting aside a report she had
been reading.</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Jarry.</p>
<p>"Apparently  they've  done  all the adapting they're able to," she told
him.</p>
<p>"Pity," said Jarry.</p>
<p>"It seems less than a  year  since  we  came  here.  Actually,  it's  a
thousand."</p>
<p>"Time flies," said Jarry.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid," she said.</p>
<p>"Of what?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Just afraid."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Living  the  way  we've been living, I guess. Leaving little pieces of
ourselves in different centuries. Just a few months ago, as my memory works,
this place was a desert. Now it's an  ice  field.  Chasms  open  and  close.
Canyons  appear  and  disappear.  Rivers  dry  up and new ones spring forth.
Everything seems so very transitory. Things  look  solid,  but  I'm  getting
afraid  to touch things now. They might go away. They might turn into smoke,
and   my   hand   will   keep   on   reaching   through   the   smoke    and
touch--something...God,  maybe. Or worse yet, maybe not. No one really knows
what it will be like here when we've finished.  We're  traveling  toward  an
unknown  land  and  it's  too late to go back. We're moving through a dream,
heading toward an idea...Sometimes I  miss  my  cell...and  all  the  little
machines that took care of me there. Maybe <emphasis>I</emphasis> can't adapt. Maybe I'm
like the green bird..."</p>
<p>"No,  Sanza.  You're not. We're real. No matter what happens out there,
<emphasis>we</emphasis> will last. Everything is changing because we want it to  change.
We're  stronger  than  the world, and we'll squeeze it and paint it and poke
holes in it until we've made it exactly the way we want it. Then we'll  take
it  and  cover  it with cities and children. You want to see God? Go look in
the mirror. God has pointed ears and green eyes. He  is  covered  with  soft
gray fur. When He raises His hand there is webbing between His fingers."</p>
<p>"It is good that you are strong, Jarry."</p>
<p>"Let's get out the power sled and go for a ride."</p>
<p>"All right."</p>
<p>Up  and  down,  that  day,  they drove through Deadland, where the dark
stones stood like clouds in another sky.</p>
<p>It was twelve and a half hundred years.</p>
<p>Now they could breathe without respirators, for a short time.</p>
<p>Now they could bear the temperature, for a short time.</p>
<p>Now all the green birds were dead.</p>
<p>Now a strange and troubling thing began.</p>
<p>The bipeds came by night, made markings on the snow, left dead  animals
in the midst of them. This happened now with much more frequency than it had
in  the past. They came long distances to do it, many of them with fur which
was not their own upon their shoulders.</p>
<p>Jarry searched through the history files for all  the  reports  on  the
creatures.</p>
<p>"This one speaks of lights in the forest," he said. "Station Seven."</p>
<p>"What...?"</p>
<p>"Fire," he said. "What if they've discovered fire?"</p>
<p>"Then they're not really beasts!"</p>
<p>"But they were!"</p>
<p>"They  wear  clothing  now.  They  make  some  sort of sacrifice to our
machines. They're not beasts any longer."</p>
<p>"How could it have happened?"</p>
<p>"How do you think? <emphasis>We</emphasis> did it. Perhaps they would have remained
stupid--animals--if we had not come along and forced them to  get  smart  in
order  to go on living. We've accelerated their evolution. They had to adapt
or die, and they adapted."</p>
<p>"D'you think it would have happened if we hadn't come along?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Maybe--some day. Maybe not, too."</p>
<p>Jarry moved to the window, stared out across Deadland.</p>
<p>"I have to find out," he  said.  "If  they  are  intelligent,  if  they
are--human,  like  us,"  he said, then laughed, "then we must consider their
ways."</p>
<p>"What do you propose?"</p>
<p>"Locate some of the creatures. See  whether  we  can  communicate  with
them."</p>
<p>"Hasn't it been tried?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What were the results?"</p>
<p>"Mixed.  Some  claim they have considerable understanding. Others place
them far below the threshold where humanity begins."</p>
<p>"We may be doing a terrible  thing,"  she  said.  "Creating  men,  then
destroying  them. Once, when I was feeling low, you told me that we were the
gods of this world, that ours was the power to  shape  and  to  break.  Ours
<emphasis>is</emphasis>  the  power  to  shape  and  break,  but I don't feel especially
divine. What can we do? They have come this far, but do you think  they  can
bear the change that will take us the rest of the way? What if they are like
the  green birds? What if they've adapted as fast and as far as they can and
it is not sufficient? What would a god do?"</p>
<p>"Whatever he wished," said Jarry.</p>
<p>That day, they cruised over Deadland in the flier, but the  only  signs
of  life they saw were each other. They continued to search in the days that
followed, but they did not meet with success.</p>
<p>Under the purple of morning, however, two weeks later, it happened.</p>
<p>"They've been here," said Sanza.</p>
<p>Jarry moved to the front of the installation and stared out.</p>
<p>The snow was broken in several places, inscribed with the lines he  had
seen before, about the form of a small, dead beast.</p>
<p>"They can't have gone very far," he said.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"We'll search in the sled."</p>
<p>Now over the snow and out, across the land called Dead they went, Sanza
driving and Jarry peering at the lines of footmarks in the blue.</p>
<p>They cruised through the occurring morning, hinting of fire and violet,
and the  wind  went  past  them  like a river, and all about them there came
sounds like the cracking of ice, the trembling of tin, the snapping of steel
strands. The bluefrosted stones stood like frozen music, and the long shadow
of their sled, black as ink, raced on ahead of them. A shower of  hailstones
drumming  upon  the  roof of their vehicle like a sudden visitation of demon
dancers, as suddenly was gone. Deadland sloped downward, slanted up again.</p>
<p>Jarry placed his hand upon Sanza's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Ahead!"</p>
<p>She nodded, began to brake the sled.</p>
<p>They had it at bay.</p>
<p>They were using clubs and long poles which looked to have fire-hardened
points. They threw stones. They threw pieces of ice.</p>
<p>Then they backed away and it killed them as they went.</p>
<p>The Catforms had called it a bear because it was  big  and  shaggy  and
could rise up onto its hind legs...</p>
<p>This  one was about three and a half meters in length, was covered with
bluish fur and had a thin, hairless snout like the business end of a pair of
pliers.</p>
<p>Five of the little creatures lay still in the snow. Each time  that  it
swung a paw and connected, another one fell.</p>
<p>Jarry removed the pistol from its compartment and checked the charge.</p>
<p>"Cruise by slowly," he told her. "I'm going to try to burn it about the
head."</p>
<p>His  first  shot  missed,  scoring  the boulder at its back. His second
singed the fur of its neck. He leapt down from the sled then, as  they  came
abreast of the beast, thumbed the power control up to maximum, and fired the
entire charge into its breast, point-blank.</p>
<p>The  bear  stiffened,  swayed,  fell,  a gaping wound upon it, front to
back.</p>
<p>Jarry turned and regarded the little creatures. They stared up at him.</p>
<p>"Hello," he said. "My name is Jarry. I dub thee Redforms--"</p>
<p>He was knocked from his feet by a blow from behind.</p>
<p>He rolled across the snow, lights dancing before his eyes, his left arm
and shoulder afire with pain.</p>
<p>A second bear had emerged from the forest of stone.</p>
<p>He drew his long hunting knife with his right hand and climbed back  to
his feet.</p>
<p>As  the  creature  lunged,  he  moved  with  the  catspeed of his kind,
thrusting upward, burying his knife to the hilt in its throat.</p>
<p>A shudder ran through it, but if cuffed him and he fell once again, the
blade torn from his grasp.</p>
<p>The Redforms threw more stones, rushed toward  it  with  their  pointed
sticks.</p>
<p>Then  there  was  a thud and a crunching sound, and it rose up into the
air and came down on top of him.</p>
<p>He awakened.</p>
<p>He lay on his back, hurting, and everything he looked at seemed  to  be
pulsing, as if about to explode.</p>
<p>How much time had passed, he did not know.</p>
<p>Either he or the bear had been moved.</p>
<p>The little creatures crouched, waiting.</p>
<p>Some watched the bear. Some watched him.</p>
<p>Some watched the broken sled...</p>
<p>The broken sled...</p>
<p>He struggled to his feet.</p>
<p>The Redforms drew back.</p>
<p>He crossed to the sled and looked inside.</p>
<p>He  knew she was dead when he saw the angle of her neck. But he did all
the things a person does to be sure, anyway, before  he  would  let  himself
believe it.</p>
<p>She  had  delivered the deathblow, crashing the sled into the creature,
breaking its back. It had broken the sled. Herself, also.</p>
<p>He leaned against the wreckage, composed his first prayer, then removed
her body.</p>
<p>The Redforms watched.</p>
<p>He  lifted  her  in  his  arms  and  began  walking,  back  toward  the
installation, across Deadland.</p>
<p>The Redforms continued to watch as he went, except for the one with the
strangely high brow-ridge, who studied instead the knife that protruded from
the shaggy and steaming throat of the beast.</p>
<p>Jarry asked the awakened executives of December: "What should we do?"</p>
<p>"She  is  the  first  of our race to die on this world," said Yan Turl,
Vice President.</p>
<p>"There  is  no  tradition,"  said  Selda  Kein,  Secretary.  "Shall  we
establish one?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Jarry. "I don't know what is right to do."</p>
<p>"Burial  or  cremation  seem  to  be  the main choices. Which would you
prefer?"</p>
<p>"I don't--No, not the ground. Give her back to  me.  Give  me  a  large
flier...I'll burn her."</p>
<p>"Then let us construct a chapel."</p>
<p>"No. It is a thing I must do in my own way. I'd rather do it alone."</p>
<p>"As you wish. Draw what equipment you will need, and be about it."</p>
<p>"Please  send someone else to keep the Deadland installation. I wish to
sleep again when I have finished this thing--until the next cycle."</p>
<p>"Very well, Jarry. We are sorry."</p>
<p>"Yes--we are."</p>
<p>Jarry nodded, gestured, turned, departed.</p>
<p>Thus are the heavier lines of life sometimes drawn.</p>
<p>At the southeastern edge of Deadland there  was  a  blue  mountain.  It
stood to slightly over three thousand meters in height. When approached from
the  northwest,  it  gave the appearance of being a frozen wave in a sea too
vast to imagine. Purple clouds rent themselves  upon  its  peak.  No  living
thing  was  to be found on its slopes. It had no name, save that which Jarry
Dark gave it.</p>
<p>He anchored the flier.</p>
<p>He carried her body to the highest point  to  which  a  body  might  be
carried.</p>
<p>He  placed  her  there,  dressed  in  her finest garments, a wide scarf
concealing the angle of her neck, a dark veil covering her emptied features.</p>
<p>He was about to try a prayer when the hail began to fall.  Like  thrown
rocks, the chunks of blue ice came down upon him, upon her.</p>
<p>"God damn you!" he cried and he raced back to the flier.</p>
<p>He climbed into the air, circled.</p>
<p>Her  garments  were  flapping  in the wind. The hail was a blue, beaded
curtain that separated them from all but these final  caresses:  fire  aflow
from ice to ice, from clay aflow immortally through guns.</p>
<p>He  squeezed  the trigger and a doorway into the sun opened in the side
of the mountain that had been nameless.  She  vanished  within  it,  and  he
widened the doorway until he had lowered the mountain.</p>
<p>Then  he  climbed  upward into the cloud, attacking the storm until his
guns were empty.</p>
<p>He circled then above the molten mesa, there at the  southeastern  edge
of Deadland.</p>
<p>He circled above the first pyre this world had seen.</p>
<p>Then he departed, to sleep for a season in silence the sleep of ice and
stone, to inherit the Alyonal. There is no dreaming in that sleep.</p>
<p>Fifteen   centuries.  Almost  half  the  Wait.  Two  hundred  words  or
less....Picture--</p>
<p>...Nineteen mighty rivers flowing, but the black seas  rippling  violet
now.</p>
<p>...No  shallow  iodine-colored forests. Mighty shag-barked barrel trees
instead, orange and lime and black and tall across the land.</p>
<p>...Great ranges of mountains in  the  place  of  hills  brown,  yellow,
white, lavender. Black corkscrews of smoke unwinding from smoldering cones.</p>
<p>...Flowers,  whose  roots  explore the soil twenty meters beneath their
mustard petals, unfolded amidst the blue frost and the stones.</p>
<p>...Blind  burrowers  burrowing  deeper;  offal-eating  murk-beasts  now
showing   formidable  incisors  and  great  rows  of  ridged  molars;  giant
caterpillars growing smaller but looking larger because of increasing coats.</p>
<p>...The contours of valleys still like the torsos of women, flowing  and
rolling, or perhaps like instruments of music.</p>
<p>...Gone much windblasted stone, but ever the frost.</p>
<p>...Sounds in the morning as always, harsh, brittle, metallic.</p>
<p>They were sure that they were halfway to heaven.</p>
<p>Picture that.</p>
<p>The Deadland log told him as much as he really needed to know.  But he read
back through the old reports, too.</p>
<p>Then he mixed himself a drink and stared out the third floor window.</p>
<p>"...Will die," he said, then finished his drink, outfitted himself, and
abandoned his post.</p>
<p>It was three days before he found a camp.</p>
<p>He landed the flier at a distance and approached on foot. He was far to
the south  of  Deadland,  where  the  air  was warmer and caused him to feel
constantly short of breath.</p>
<p>They were wearing animal skins--skins which had been cut for  a  better
fit  and  greater  protection,  skins which were tied about them. He counted
sixteen lean-to arrangements and three campfires. He flinched as he regarded
the fires, but he continued to advance.</p>
<p>When they saw him, all their little noises stopped, a  brief  cry  went
up, and there was silence.</p>
<p>He entered the camp.</p>
<p>The  creatures  stood unmoving about him. He heard some bustling within
the large lean-to at the end of the clearing.</p>
<p>He walked about the camp.</p>
<p>A slab of dried meat hung from the center of a tripod of poles.</p>
<p>Several long spears stood before each dwelling place. He  advanced  and
studied  one. A stone which had been flaked into a leaf-shaped spearhead was
affixed to its end.</p>
<p>There was the outline of a cat carved upon a block of wood...</p>
<p>He heard a footfall and turned.</p>
<p>One of the Redforms moved slowly toward him. It appeared older than the
others. Its shoulders sloped; as it opened its mouth to  make  a  series  of
popping  noises,  he  saw  that some of its teeth were missing; its hair was
grizzled and thin. It bore something in its hands, but Jarry's attention was
drawn to the hands themselves.</p>
<p>Each hand bore an opposing digit.</p>
<p>He looked about him quickly, studying the hands of the others.  All  of
them seemed to have thumbs. He studied their appearance more closely.</p>
<p>They now had foreheads.</p>
<p>He returned his attention to the old Redform.</p>
<p>It placed something at his feet, and then it backed away from him.</p>
<p>He looked down.</p>
<p>A chunk of dried meat and a piece of fruit lay upon a broad leaf.</p>
<p>He  picked  up  the  meat, closed his eyes, bit off a piece, chewed and
swallowed. He wrapped the rest in the leaf and placed it in the side  pocket
of his pack.</p>
<p>He extended his hand and the Redform drew back.</p>
<p>He  lowered  his hand, unrolled the blanket he had carried with him and
spread it upon the ground. He seated himself, pointed to the  Redform,  then
indicated a position across from him at the other end of the blanket.</p>
<p>The creature hesitated, then advanced and seated itself.</p>
<p>"We  are going to learn to talk with one another," he said slowly. Then
he placed his hand upon his breast and said, "Jarry."</p>
<p>Jarry stood before the reawakened executives of December.</p>
<p>"They are intelligent," he told them. "It's all in my report."</p>
<p>"So?" asked Yan Turl.</p>
<p>"I don't think they will be able to adapt. They  have  come  very  far,
very rapidly. But I don't think they can go much further. I don't think they
can make it all the way."</p>
<p>"Are you a biologist, an ecologist, a chemist?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then on what do you base your opinion?"</p>
<p>"I observed them at close range for six weeks."</p>
<p>"Then it's only a feeling you have...?"</p>
<p>"You  know  there  are  no  experts  on  a  thing like this. It's never
happened before."</p>
<p>"Granting their intelligence--granting even that  what  you  have  said
concerning  their  adaptability  is correct--what do you suggest we do about
it?"</p>
<p>"Slow down the change. Give them a better chance. If they can't make it
the rest of the way, then stop short of our goal. It's already livable here.
We can adapt the rest of the way."</p>
<p>"Slow it down? How much?"</p>
<p>"Supposing we took another seven or eight thousand years?"</p>
<p>"Impossible!"</p>
<p>"Entirely!"</p>
<p>"Too much!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because everyone stands a three-month watch every  two  hundred  fifty
years.  That's  one  year of personal time for every thousand. You're asking
for too much of everyone's time."</p>
<p>"But the life of an entire race may be at stake!"</p>
<p>"You do not know that for certain."</p>
<p>"No, I don't. But do you feel it is something to take a chance with?"</p>
<p>"Do you want to put it to an executive vote?"</p>
<p>"No--I can see that I'll lose. I want  to  put  it  before  the  entire
membership."</p>
<p>"Impossible. They're all asleep."</p>
<p>"Then wake them up."</p>
<p>"That would be quite a project."</p>
<p>"Don't  you  think  the  fate of a race is worth the effort? Especially
since we're the ones who forced intelligence upon them? We're the  ones  who
made them evolve, cursed them with intellect."</p>
<p>"Enough!  They  were  right  at  the  threshold. They might have become
intelligent had we <emphasis>not</emphasis> come along"</p>
<p>"But you can't say for certain! You don't really know! And  it  doesn't
really  matter  how it happened. They're here and we're here, and they think
we're gods--maybe because we do nothing for them but make them miserable. We
have some responsibility to an intelligent race, though.  At  least  to  the
extent of not murdering it."</p>
<p>"Perhaps we could do a long-range study..."</p>
<p>"They  could  be  dead  by  then.  I  formally  move, in my capacity as
Treasurer, that we awaken the full membership and put the matter to a vote."</p>
<p>"I don't hear any second to your motion."</p>
<p>"Selda?" he said.</p>
<p>She looked away.</p>
<p>"Tarebell? Clond? Bondici?"</p>
<p>There was silence in the cavern that was high and wide about him.</p>
<p>"All right. I can see when I'm beaten. We will be our own serpents when
we come into our Eden. I'm going now, back to Deadland, to finish my tour of
duty."</p>
<p>"You don't have to. In fact, it might be better if you sleep the  whole
thing out..."</p>
<p>"No.  If it's going to be this way, the guilt will be mine also. I want
to watch, to share it fully."</p>
<p>"So be it," said Turl.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, when Installation Nineteen tried to raise the Deadland
Station on the radio, there was no response.</p>
<p>After a time, a flier was dispatched.</p>
<p>The Deadland Station was a shapeless lump of melted metal.</p>
<p>Jarry Dark was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Later than afternoon, Installation Eight went dead.</p>
<p>A flier was immediately dispatched.</p>
<p>Installation Eight no longer existed. Its attendants were found several
miles away, walking. They told how Jarry  Dark  had  forced  them  from  the
station  at  gunpoint.  Then  he  had  burnt  it  to  the  ground,  with the
fire-cannons mounted upon his flier.</p>
<p>At about the time they were telling this story, Installation Six became
silent.</p>
<p>The order went out: MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS RADIO CONTACT  WITH  TWO  OTHER
STATIOINS AT ALL TIMES.</p>
<p>The  other  order  went  out:  GO  ARMED AT ALL TIMES. TAKE ANY VISITOR
PRISONER.</p>
<p>Jarry waited. At the bottom of a chasm, parked beneath a shelf of rock,
Jarry waited. An opened bottle stood upon the control board  of  his  flier.
Next to it was a small case of white metal.</p>
<p>Jarry  took  a  long,  last  drink from the bottle as he waited for the
broadcast he knew would come.</p>
<p>When it did, he stretched out on the seat and took a nap.</p>
<p>When he awakened, the light of day was waning.</p>
<p>The broadcast was still going on...</p>
<p>"...Jarry. They will be awakened and a referendum will  be  held.  Come
back  to  the  main cavern. This is Yan Turl. Please do not destroy any more
installations. This action is not necessary. We  agree  with  your  proposal
that  a vote be held. Please contact us immediately. We are waiting for your
reply, Jarry..."</p>
<p>He tossed the empty bottle through the window and raised the flier  out
of the purple shadow into the air and up.</p>
<p>When he descended upon the landing stage within the main cavern, of course
they were waiting for him.  A dozen rifles were trained upon him as he
stepped down from the flier.</p>
<p>"Remove your weapons, Jarry," came the voice of Yan Turl.</p>
<p>"I'm  not  wearing  any weapons," said Jarry. "Neither is my flier," he
added; and this was true, for the fire-cannons no longer rested within their
mountings.</p>
<p>Yan Turl approached, looked up at him.</p>
<p>"Then you may step down."</p>
<p>"Thank you, but I like it right where I am."</p>
<p>"You are a prisoner."</p>
<p>"What do you intend to do with me?"</p>
<p>"Put you back to sleep until the end of the Wait. Come down here!"</p>
<p>"No. And don't try shooting--or using a stun charge or gas, either.  If
you do, we're all of us dead the second it hits."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" asked Turl, gesturing gently to the riflemen.</p>
<p>"My  flier,"  said  Jarry,  "is  a bomb, and I'm holding the fuse in my
right hand." He raised the white metal box. "So long as I keep the lever  on
the  side  of  this  box depressed, we live. If my grip relaxes, even for an
instant, the explosion which  ensues  will  doubtless  destroy  this  entire
cavern."</p>
<p>"I think you're bluffing."</p>
<p>"You know how you can find out for certain."</p>
<p>"You'll die too, Jarry."</p>
<p>"At  the  moment,  I  don't really care. Don't try burning my hand off,
either, to destroy the fuse,"  he  cautioned,  "because  it  doesn't  really
matter.  Even  if  you  should  succeed,  it  will  cost  you  at  least two
installations."</p>
<p>"Why is that?"</p>
<p>"What do you think I did with the fire-cannons? I taught  the  Redforms
how  to  use  them.  At the moment, these weapons are manned by Redforms and
aimed at two installations. If I do not personally visit my gunners by dawn,
they will open fire. After destroying their objectives, they  will  move  on
and try for two more."</p>
<p>"You trusted those beasts with laser projectors?"</p>
<p>"That  is  correct.  Now,  will  you begin awakening the others for the
voting?"</p>
<p>Turl crouched, as if to spring at him, appeared to think better of  it,
relaxed.</p>
<p>"Why  did  you  do it, Jarry?" he asked. "What are they to you that you
would make your own people suffer for them?"</p>
<p>"Since you do not feel as I feel," said Jarry, "my reasons  would  mean
nothing  to  you. After all, they are only based upon my feelings, which are
different than your own--for mine are based upon sorrow and loneliness.  Try
this  one,  though:  I  am  their god. My form is to be found in their every
camp. I am the Slayer of Bears from the Desert of the Dead. They  have  told
my  story  for two and a half centuries, and I have been changed by it. I am
powerful and wise and good, so far as they are concerned. In this  capacity,
I  owe  them some consideration. If I do not give them their lives, who will
there be to honor me in snow and chant my story around the fires and cut for
me the best portions of the woolly caterpillar? None, Turl. And these things
are all that my life is worth now. Awaken the others. You have no choice."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Turl. "And if their decision should go against you?"</p>
<p>"Then I'll retire, and you can be god," said Jarry.</p>
<p>Now every day when the sun goes down out of the purple sky, Jarry  Dark
watches  it  in its passing, for he shall sleep no more the sleep of ice and
of stone, wherein there is no dreaming. He has elected to live out the  span
of  his  days  in  a  tiny  instant  of the Wait, never to look upon the New
Alyonal of his people. Every morning, at the new Deadland  Installation,  he
is  awakened  by  sounds like the cracking of ice, the trembling of tin, the
snapping of steel strands, before they come to  him  with  their  offerings,
singing  and  making marks upon the snow. They praise him and he smiles upon
them. Sometimes he coughs.</p>
<p>Born of man and woman, in  accordance  with  Catform  Y7  requirements,
Coldworld  Class,  Jarry  Dark  was not suited for existence anywhere in the
universe which had guaranteed him a niche. This was either a blessing  or  a
curse,  depending  on how you looked at it. So look at it however you would,
that was the story. Thus does life repay those who would serve her fully.</p>

<section>

<p>Murdock sped across the Great Western Road Plain.</p>
<p>High above him the sun was a fiery yo-yo as he took the
innumerable hillocks and rises of the Plain at better than a
hundred-sixty miles an hour.  He did now slow for anything, and
Jenny's hidden eyes spotted all the rocks and potholes before they
came to them, and she carefully adjusted their course, sometimes
without his even detecting the subtle movement of the steering column
beneath his hands.</p>
<p>Even through the dark-tinted windshield and the thick goggles he
wore, the glare from the fused Plain burnt into his eyes, so that at
times it seemed as if he were steering a very fast boat through night,
beneath a brilliant alien moon, and that he was cutting his way across
a lake of silver fire.  Tall dust waves rose in his wake, hung in the
air, and after a time settled once more.</p>
<p>"You are wearing yourself out," said the radio, "sitting there
clutching the wheel that way, squinting ahead.  Why don't you try to
get some rest?  Let me fog the shields.  Go to sleep and leave the
driving to me."</p>
<p>"No," he said, "I want it this way."</p>
<p>"All right," said Jenny.  "I just thought I would ask."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>About a minute later the radio began playingit was a soft,
stringy sort of music.</p>
<p>"Cut that out!"</p>
<p>"Sorry, boss.  Thought it might relax you."</p>
<p>"When I need relaxing, _I'll_ tell _you_."</p>
<p>"Check, Sam.  Sorry."</p>
<p>The silence seemed oppressive after its brief interruption.  She
was a good car, though, Murdock knew that.  She was always concerned
with his welfare, and she was anxious to get on with his quest.</p>
<p>She was made to look like a carefree Swinger sedan: bright red,
gaudy, fast.  But there were rockets under the bulges of her hood, and
two fifty-caliber muzzles lurked just out of sight in the recesses
beneath her headlamps; she wore a belt of five and ten-second timed
grenades across her belly; and in her trunk was a spray-tank
containing a highly volatile naphthalic.</p>
<p>....for his Jenny was a specially designed deathcar, built for him
by the Archengineer of the Geeyem Dynasty, far to the East, and all
the cunning of that great artificer had gone into her construction.</p>
<p>"We'll find it this time, Jenny," he said, "and I didn't mean to snap
at you like I did."</p>
<p>"That's all right, Sam," said the delicate voice.  "I am
programmed to understand you."</p>
<p>They roared on across the Great Plain and the sun fell away to the
west.  All night and all day they had searched, and Murdock was tired.
The last Fuel Stop/Rest Stop Fortress seemed so long ago, so far
back...</p>
<p>Murdock leaned forward and his eyes closed.</p>
<p>The windows slowly darkened into complete opacity.  The seat belt
crept higher and drew him back away from the wheel.  Then the seat
gradually leaned backwards until he was reclining on a level plane.
The heater came on as the night approached, later.</p>
<p>The seat shook him awake, a little before five in the morning.</p>
<p>"Wake up, Sam!  Wake up!"</p>
<p>"What is it?" he mumbled.</p>
<p>"I picked up a broadcast twenty minutes ago.  There was a recent
car-raid out this way.  I changed immediately, and we are almost
there."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you get me up right away?"</p>
<p>"You needed the sleep, and there was nothing you could do but get
tense and nervous."</p>
<p>"Okay, you're probably right.  Tell me about the raid."</p>
<p>"Six vehicles, proceeding westward, were apparently ambushed by an
undetermined number of wild cars sometimes last night.  The Patrol
Copter was reporting it from above the scene and I listened in.  All
the vehicles were stripped and drained and their brains were smashed,
and their passengers were all apparently killed too.  There were no
signs of movement."</p>
<p>"How far is it now?"</p>
<p>"Another two or three minutes."</p>
<p>The windshields came clear once more, and Murdock stared as far
ahead through the night as the powerful lamps could cut.</p>
<p>"I see something," he said, after a few moments.</p>
<p>"This is the place," said Jenny, and she began to slow down.</p>
<p>They drew up beside the ravaged cars.  His seat belt unstrapped
and the door sprang open on his side.</p>
<p>"Circle around, Jenny," he said, "and look for heat tracks.  I
won't be long."</p>
<p>The door slammed and Jenny moved away from him.  He snapped on his
pocket torch and moved toward the wrecked vehicles.</p>
<p>The Plain was like a sand-strewn dance floorhard and
grittybeneath his feet.  There were many skid-marks, and a
spaghetti-work of tire tracks lay all about the area.</p>
<p>A dead man sat behind the wheel of the first car.  His neck was
obviously broken.  The smashed watch on his wrist said 2:24.  There
were three personstwo women and a young manlying about forty feet
away.  They had been run down as they tried to flee from their
assaulted vehicles.</p>
<p>Murdock moved on, inspected the others.  All six cars were
upright.  Most of the damage was to their bodies.  The tires and
wheels had been removed from all of them, as well as essential
portions of their engines; the gas tanks stood open, siphoned empty;
the spare tires were gone from the sprung trunks.  There were no
living passengers.</p>
<p>Jenny pulled up beside him and her door opened.</p>
<p>"Sam," she said, "pull the brain leads on that blue car, the third
one back.  It's still drawing some energy from an ancillary battery,
and I can hear it broadcasting."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Murdock went back and tore the leads free.  He returned to Jenny
and climbed into the driver's seat.</p>
<p>"Did you find anything?"</p>
<p>"Some traces, heading northwest."</p>
<p>"Follow them."</p>
<p>The door slammed and Jenny turned in that direction.</p>
<p>They drove for about five minutes in silence.  Then Jenny said
"There were eight cars in that convoy."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I just heard it on the news.  Apparently two of the cars
communicated with the wild ones on an off-band.  They threw in with
them.  They gave away their location and turned on the others at the
time of the attack."</p>
<p>"What about their passengers?"</p>
<p>"They probably monoed them before they joined the pack."</p>
<p>Murdock lit a cigarette, his hands shaking.</p>
<p>"Jenny, what makes a car run wild?" he asked.  "Never knowing when
it will get its next fuelingor being sure of finding spare parts for
its auto-repair unit?  Why do they do it?"</p>
<p>"I do not know, Sam.  I have never thought about it."</p>
<p>"Ten years ago the Devil Car, their leader, killed my brother in a
raid on his Gas Fortress," said Murdock, "and I've hunted that black
Caddy ever since.  I've searched for it form the air and I've searched
on foot.  I've used other cars.  I've carried heat trackers and
missiles.  I even laid mines.  But always it's been too fast or too
smart or too strong for me.  Then I had you built."</p>
<p>"I knew you hated it very much.  I always wondered why," Jenny
said.</p>
<p>Murdock drew on his cigarette.</p>
<p>"I had you specially programmed and armored and armed to be the
toughest, fastest, smartest thing on wheels, Jenny.  You're the
Scarlet Lady.  You're the one car can take the Caddy and his whole
pack.  You've got fangs and claws of the kind they've never met
before.  This time I'm going to get them."</p>
<p>"You could have stayed home, Sam, and let me do the hunting."</p>
<p>"No.  I know I could have, but I want to be there.  I want to give
the orders, to press some of the buttons myself, to watch that Devil
Car burn away to a metal skeleton.  How many people, how many cars has
it smashed?  We've lost count.  I've got to get it, Jenny!"</p>
<p>"I'll find it for you, Sam."</p>
<p>They sped on, at around two hundred miles per hour.</p>
<p>"How's the fuel look, Jenny?"</p>
<p>"Plenty there, and I have not yet drawn upon the auxiliary tanks.
Do not worry."</p>
<p>"The track is getting stronger," she added.</p>
<p>"Good.  How's the weapons system?"</p>
<p>"Red light, all around.  Ready to go."</p>
<p>Murdock snubbed out his cigarette and lit another.</p>
<p>"...Some of them carry dead people strapped inside," said Murdock,
"so they'll look like decent cars with passengers.  The black Caddy
does it all the time, and it changes them pretty regularly.  It keeps
its interior refrigeratedso they'll last."</p>
<p>"You know a lot about it, Sam."</p>
<p>"It fooled my brother with phoney passengers and phoney plates.
Hot him to open his Gas Fortress to it that way.  Then the whole pack
attacked.  It's painted itself red and green and blue and white, on
different occasions, but it always goes back to black, sooner or
later.  It doesn't like yellow or brown or two-tone.  I've a list of
almost every phoney plate it's ever used.  It's even driven the big
freeways right into towns and fueled up at regular gas stops.  They
often get its number as it tears away from them, just as the attendant
goes up on the driver's side for his money.  It can fake dozens of
human voices.  They can never catch it afterwards, though, because
it's souped itself up too well.  It always makes it back here to the
Plain and loses them.  It's even raided used car lots"</p>
<p>Jenny turned sharply in her course.</p>
<p>"Sam!  The trail is quite strong now.  _This_ way!  It goes off in
the direction of those mountains."</p>
<p>"Follow!" said Murdock.</p>
<p>For a long time then Murdock was silent.  The first inklings of
morning began in the east.  The pale morning star was a white
thumbtack on a blueboard behind them.  They began to climb a gently
slope.</p>
<p>"Get it, Jenny.  Go get it," urged Murdock.</p>
<p>"I think we will," she said.</p>
<p>The angle of the slope increased.  Jenny slowed her pace to match
the terrain, which was becoming somewhat bumpy.  "What the matter?"
asked Murdock.</p>
<p>"It's harder going here," she said, "also, the trail is getting
more difficult to follow."</p>
<p>"Why's that?"</p>
<p>"There is still a lot of background radiation in these parts," she
told him, "and it is throwing off my tracking system."</p>
<p>"Keep trying, Jenny."</p>
<p>"The track seems to go straight toward the mountains."</p>
<p>"Follow it, follow it!"</p>
<p>They slowed some more.</p>
<p>"I am all fouled up now, Sam," she said.  "I have just lost the
trail."</p>
<p>"It must have a stronghold somewhere around herea cave or
something like thatwhere it can be sheltered overhead.  It's the only
way it could have escaped aerial detection all these years."</p>
<p>"What should I do?"</p>
<p>"Go as far forward as you can and scan for low openings in the
rock.  Be wary.  Be ready to attack in an instant."</p>
<p>They climbed into the low foothills.  Jenny's aerial rose high
into the air, and the moths of steel cheesecloth unfolded their wings
and danced and spun about it, bright there in the morning light.</p>
<p>"Nothing yet," said Jenny, "and we can't go much further."</p>
<p>"Then we'll cruise along the length of it and keep scanning."</p>
<p>"To the right or to the left?"</p>
<p>"I don't know.  Which way would you go it you were a renegade car
on the lam?"</p>
<p>"I do not know."</p>
<p>"Pick one.  It doesn't matter."</p>
<p>"To the right, then," she said, and they turned in that direction.</p>
<p>After half an hour the night was dropping away behind the mountains.
To his right morning was exploding at the far end of the Plains,
fracturing the sky into all the colors of autumn trees.  Murdock drew
a squeeze bottle of hot coffee, of the kind spacers had once used,
from beneath the dashboard.</p>
<p>"Sam, I think I have found something."</p>
<p>"What?  Where?"</p>
<p>"Ahead, to the left of that big boulder, a declivity with some
kind of opening at its end."</p>
<p>"Okay, baby, make for it.  Rockets ready."</p>
<p>They pulled abreast of the boulder, circled around its far side,
headed downhill.</p>
<p>"A cave, or a tunnel," he said.  "Go slow"</p>
<p>"Heat!  Heat!" she said.  "I'm tracking again!"</p>
<p>"I can even see the tire marks, lots of them!" said Murdock.
"This is it!"</p>
<p>They moved toward the opening.</p>
<p>"Go in, but go slowly," he ordered.  "Blast the first thing that
moves."</p>
<p>They entered the rocky portal, moving on sand now.  Jenny turned
off her visible lights and switched to infra-red.  An i-r lens rose
before the windshield, and Murdock studied the cave.  It was about
twenty feet high and wide enough to accommodate perhaps three cars
going abreast.  The floor changed from sand to rock, but it was smooth
and fairly level.  After a time it sloped upward.</p>
<p>"There's some light ahead," he whispered.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"A piece of the sky, I think."</p>
<p>They crept toward it, Jenny's engine but the barest sigh within
the great chambers of rock.</p>
<p>They stopped at the threshold to the light.  The i-r shield
dropped again.</p>
<p>It was a sand-and-shale canyon that he looked upon.  Huge
slantings and overhangs of rock hid all but the far end from any eye
in the sky.  The light was pale, at the far end, and there was nothing
unusual beneath it.</p>
<p>But nearer...</p>
<p>Murdock blinked.</p>
<p>Nearer, in the dim light of morning and in the shadows, stood the
greatest junkheap Murdock had ever seen in his life.</p>
<p>Pieces of cars, of every make and model, were heaped into a small
mountain before him.  There were batteries and tires and cables and
shock absorbers; there were fenders and bumpers and headlamps and
headlamp housings; there were doors and windshields and cylinders and
pistons, carburetors, generators, voltage regulators, and oil pimps.</p>
<p>Murdock stared.</p>
<p>"Jenny," he whispered, "we've found the graveyard of the autos!"</p>
<p>A very old car, which Murdock had not even distinguished from the
junk during that first glance, jerked several feet in their direction
and stopped as suddenly.  The sound of rivet heads scoring ancient
brake drums screeched in his ears.  Its tires were completely bald,
and the left front one was badly in need of air.  Its right front
headlamp was broken and there was a crack in its windshield.  It stood
there before the heap, its awakened engine making a terrible rattling
noise.</p>
<p>"What's happening?" asked Murdock.  "What is it?"</p>
<p>"He is talking to me," said Jenny.  "He is very old.  His
speedometer has been all the way around so many times that he forgets
the number of miles he has seen.  He hates people, whom he says have
abused him whenever they could.  He is the guardian of the graveyard.
He is too old to go raiding any more, so he has stood guard over the
spare parts heap for many years.  He is not the sort who can repair
himself, as the younger ones do, so he must rely on their charity and
their auto-repair units.  He wants to know what I want here."</p>
<p>"Ask him where the others are."</p>
<p>But as he said it, Murdock heard the sound of many engines turning
over, until the valley was filled with the thunder of their
horsepower.</p>
<p>"They are parked on the other side of the heap," she said.  "They
are coming now."</p>
<p>"Hold back until I tell you to fire," said Murdock, ad the first
onea sleek yellow Chryslernosed around the heap.</p>
<p>Murdock lowered his head to the steering wheel, but kept his eyes
open behind his goggles.</p>
<p>"Tell him that you came here to join the pack and that you've
monoed your driver.  Try to get the black Caddy to come into range."</p>
<p>"He will not do it," she said.  "I am talking with him now.  He
can broadcast just as easily from the other side of the pile, and he
says he is sending the six biggest members of the pack to guard me
while he decides what to do.  He has ordered me to leave the tunnel
and pull ahead into the valley."</p>
<p>"Go ahead, thenslowly."</p>
<p>They crept forward.</p>
<p>Two Lincolns, a powerful-looking Pontiac, and two Mercs joined the
Chryslerthree cars on each side of them, in position to ram.</p>
<p>"Has he given you and idea how many there are on the other side?"</p>
<p>"No.  I asked, but he will not tell me."</p>
<p>"Well, we'll just have to wait then."</p>
<p>He stayed slumped, pretending to be dead.  After a time, his
already tired shoulders began to ache.  Finally, Jenny spoke:</p>
<p>"He wants me to pull around the far end of the pile," she said,
"now that they have cleared the way, and to head into a gap in the
rock which he will indicate.  He wants to have his auto-mech go over
me."</p>
<p>"We can't have that," said Murdock, "but head around the pile.
I'll tell you what to do when I've gotten a glimpse of the other
side."</p>
<p>The two Mercs and the Big Chief drew aside and Jenny crept past
them.  Murdock stared upwards from the corner of his eye, up at the
towering mound of junk they were passing.  A couple well-placed
rockets on either end could topple it, but the auto-mech would
probably clear it eventually.</p>
<p>They rounded the lefthand end of the pile.</p>
<p>Something like forty-five cars were facing them at about a
hundred-twenty yard's distance, to the right and ahead.  They had
fanned out.  They were blocking the exit around the other end of the
pile, and the six guards in back of him now blocked the way behind
Murdock.</p>
<p>On the far side of the farthest rank of the most distant cars an
ancient black Caddy was parked.</p>
<p>It had been beaten forth from assembly during a year when the
apprentice-engineers were indeed thinking big.  Huge it was, and
shiny, and a skeleton's face smiled from behind its wheel.  Black it
was, and gleaming chromium, and its headlamps were like dusky jewels
or the eyes of insects.  Every plane and curve shimmered with power,
and its great fishtailed rear end seemed ready to slap at the sea of
shadows behind it on an instant's notice, as it sprang forward for its
kill.</p>
<p>"That's it!" whispered Murdock.  "The Devil Car!"</p>
<p>"He is big!" said Jenny.  "I have never seen a car that big!"</p>
<p>They continued to move forward.</p>
<p>"He wants me to head into that opening and park," she said.</p>
<p>"Head toward it, slowly.  But don't go into it," said Murdock.</p>
<p>They turned and inched toward the opening.  The other cars stood, the
sounds of their engines rising and falling.</p>
<p>"Check all weapons systems."</p>
<p>"Red, all around."</p>
<p>The opening was twenty-five feet away.</p>
<p>"When I saw `now,' go into neutral steer and turn one
hundred-eighty degreesfast.  They can't be expecting that.  They
don't have it themselves.  Then open up with the fifty-calibers and
fire your rockets at the Caddy, turn at a right angle and start back
the way we came, and spray the naphtha as we go, and fire on the six
guards...</p>
<p>"Now!" he cried, leaping up in his seat.</p>
<p>He was slammed back as they spun, and he heard the clattering of
her guns before his head cleared.  By then, flames were leaping up in
the distance.</p>
<p>Jenny's guns were extruded now and turning on their mounts,
spraying the line of vehicles with hundreds of leaden hammers.  She
shook, twice, as she discharged two rockets from beneath her partly
opened hood.  Then they were moving forward, and eight or nine of the
cars were rushing downhill toward them.</p>
<p>She turned again in neutral steer and sprang back in the direction
from which they had come, around the southeast corner of the pile.
Her guns were hammering at the now retreating guards, and in the wide
read view mirror Murdock could see that a wall of flame was towering
high behind them.</p>
<p>"You missed it!" he cried.  "You missed the black Caddy!  You
rockets hit the cars in front of it and it backed off!"</p>
<p>"I know!  I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>"You had a clear shot!"</p>
<p>"I know!  I missed!"</p>
<p>They rounded the pile just as two of the guard cars vanished into
the tunnel.  Three more lay in smoking ruin.  The sixth had evidently
preceded the other two out through the passage.</p>
<p>"Here it comes now!" cried Murdock.  "Around the other end of the
pile!  Kill it!  Kill it!"</p>
<p>The ancient guardian of the graveyardit looked like a Ford, but
he couldn't be suremoved forward with a dreadful chattering sound and
interposed itself in the line of fire.</p>
<p>"My range is blocked."</p>
<p>"Smash that junkheap and cover the tunnel!  Don't let the Caddy
escape!"</p>
<p>"I can't!" she said.</p>
<p>"Who not?"</p>
<p>"I just _can't_!"</p>
<p>"That's an order!  Smash it and cover the tunnel!"</p>
<p>Her guns swivelled and she shot out the tires beneath the ancient
car.</p>
<p>The Caddy shot past and into the passageway.</p>
<p>"You let it get by!" he screamed.  "Get after it!"</p>
<p>"All right, Sam!  I'm doing it!  Don't yell.  _Please don't
tell!_"</p>
<p>She headed for the tunnel.  Inside, he could hear the sound of a
giant engine racing away, growing softer in the distance.</p>
<p>"Don't fire here in the tunnel!  If you hit it we may be bottled
in!"</p>
<p>"I know.  I won't."</p>
<p>"Drop a couple ten-second grenades and step on the gas.  Maybe we
can seal in whatever's left moving back there."</p>
<p>Suddenly they shot ahead and emerged into daylight.  There was no
sign of any other vehicle about.</p>
<p>"Find its track," he said, "and start chasing it."</p>
<p>There was an explosion up the hill behind him, within the
mountain.  The ground trembled, then it was still once more.</p>
<p>"There are so many tracks..." she said.</p>
<p>"You know the one I want.  The biggest, the widest, the hottest!
Find it!  Run it down!"</p>
<p>"I think I have it, Sam."</p>
<p>"Okay.  Proceed as rapidly as possible for this terrain."</p>
<p>Murdock found a squeeze bottle of bourbon and took three gulps.
Then he lit a cigarette and glared into the distance.</p>
<p>"Why did you miss it?" he asked softly.  "Why did you miss it,
Jenny?"</p>
<p>She did not answer immediately.  He waited.</p>
<p>Finally, "because he is not an `it' to me," she said.  "He has done
much damage to cars and people, and that is terrible.  But there is
something about him, somethingnoble.  The way he has fought the whole
world for his freedom.  Sam, keeping that pack of vicious machines in
line, stopping at nothing to maintain himself that waywithout a
masterfor as long as he can remain unsmashed, unbeatenSam, for a
moment back there I wanted to join his pack, to run with him across
the Gas Road Plains, to use my rockets against the gates of the Gas
Forts for him...But I could not mono you, Sam.  I was built for you.
I am too domesticated.  I am too weak.  I could not shoot him though,
and I misfired the rockets on purpose.  But I could never mono you,
Sam, really."</p>
<p>"Thanks," he said, "you over-programmed ashcan.  Thanks a lot!"</p>
<p>"I am sorry, Sam."</p>
<p>"Shut upNo, don't, not yet.  First tell me what you're going to
do if we find `him'."</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Well think it over fast.  You see that dust cloud ahead of us as
well as I do, and you'd better speed up."</p>
<p>They shot forward.</p>
<p>"Wait till I call Detroit.  They'll laugh themselves silly, till I
claim the refund."</p>
<p>"I am _not_ of inferior construction or design.  You know that.  I
am just more..."</p>
<p>"'Emotional'," supplied Murdock.</p>
<p>"...Than I thought I would be," she finished.  "I had not really
met many cars, except for young ones, before I was shipped to you.  I
did not know what a wild car was like, and I had never smashed _any_
cars beforejust targets and things like that.  I was young and..."</p>
<p>"`Innocent'," said Murdock.  "Yeah.  Very touching.  Get ready to
kill the next car we meet.  If it happens to be your boyfriend and you
hold your fire, then he'll kill us."</p>
<p>"I will try, Sam."</p>
<p>The car ahead had stopped.  It was the yellow Chrysler.  Two of
its tires had gone flat and it was parked, lopsided, waiting.</p>
<p>"Leave it!" snarled Murdock, as the hood clicked open.  "Save the
ammo for something that might fight back."</p>
<p>They sped past it.</p>
<p>"Did it say anything?"</p>
<p>"Machine profanity," she said.  "I've only heard it once or twice,
and it would be meaningless to you."</p>
<p>He chuckled.  "Cars actually sweat at each other?"</p>
<p>"Occasionally," she said.  "I imaging the lower sort indulge in it
more frequently, especially on freeways and turnpikes when they become
congested."</p>
<p>"Let me hear a swear-word."</p>
<p>"I will not.  What kind of car do you think I am, anyway?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said Murdock.  "You're a lady.  I forgot."</p>
<p>There was an audible click within the radio.</p>
<p>They raced forward on the level ground that lay before the foot of
the mountains.  Murdock took another drink, then switched to coffee.</p>
<p>"Ten years," he muttered, "ten years..."</p>
<p>The trail swung in a wide curve as the mountains jogged back and
the foothills sprang up high beside them.</p>
<p>It was over almost before he knew it.</p>
<p>As they passed a huge, orange-colored stone massif, sculpted like
an upside-down toadstool by the wind, there was a clearing to the
right.</p>
<p>It shot forward at themthe Devil Car.  It had lain in ambush,
seeing that it could not outrun the Scarlet Lady, and it rushed toward
a final collision with its hunter.</p>
<p>Jenny skidded sideways as her brakes caught with a scream and a
smell of smoke, and her fifty-calibers were firing, and her hood
sprang open and her front wheels rose up off the ground as the rockets
leapt wailing ahead, and she spun around three times, her rear bumper
scraping the saltsand plain, and the third and last time she fired her
remaining rockets into the smouldering wreckage on the hillside, and she
came to a rest on all four wheels; and her fifty-calibers kept firing
until they were emptied, and then a steady clicking sound came from
them for a full minute afterwards, and then all lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>Murdock sat there shaking, watching the gutted, twisted wreck
blaze against the sky.</p>
<p>"You did it, Jenny.  You killed him.  You killed me the Devil
Car," he said.</p>
<p>But she did not answer him.  Her engine started once more and she
turned toward the southeast and headed for the Fuel Stop/Rest Stop
Fortress that lay in that civilized direction</p>
<p>For two hours they drove in silence, and Murdock drank all his bourbon
and all his coffee and smoked all his cigarettes.</p>
<p>"Jenny, say something," he said.  "What's the matter?  Tell me."</p>
<p>There was a click, and her voice was very soft:</p>
<p>"Samhe talked to me as he came down the hill..." she said.</p>
<p>Murdock waited, but she did not say anything else.</p>
<p>"Well, what did he say?" he asked.</p>
<p>"He said, `Say you will mono your passenger and I will swerve by
you'," she told him.  "He said, `I want you, Scarlet Ladyto run with
me, to raid with me.  Together they will never catch us,' and I killed
him."</p>
<p>Murdock was silent.</p>
<p>"He only said that to delay my firing though, did he not?  He said
that to stop me, so that he could smash us both when he went smash
himself, did he not?  He could not have meant it, could he, Sam?"</p>
<p>"Of course not," said Murdock, "of course not.  It was too late
for him to swerve."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose it wasdo you think though, that he really wanted
me to run with him, to raid with himbefore everything, I meanback
there?"</p>
<p>"Probably, baby.  You're pretty well-equipped."</p>
<p>"Thanks," she said, and turned off again.</p>
<p>Before she did though, he heard a strange sound mechanical sound,
falling into the rhythms of profanity or prayer.</p>
<p>Then he shook his head and lowered it, softly patting the seat
beside him with his still unsteady hand.

<title><p>I</p></title>


<p>I was busy translating one of my <emphasis>Madrigals Macabre</emphasis> into Martian
on the morning I was found acceptable.  The intercom had buzzed
briefly, and I dropped my pencil and flipped on the toggle in a single
motion.</p>
<p>"Mister G," piped Morton's youthful contralto, "the old man says I
should `get hold of that damned conceited rhymer` right away, and send
him to his cabin.  Since there's only one damned conceited rhymer..."</p>
<p>"Let not ambition mock thy useful toil."  I cut him off.</p>
<p>So, the Martians had finally made up their minds!  I knocked an
inch and a half of ash from a smoldering butt, and took my first drag
since I had lit it.  The entire month's anticipation tried hard to
crowd itself into the moment, but could not quite make it.  I was
frightened to walk those forty feet and hear Emory say the words I
already knew he would say; and that feeling elbowed the other one into
the background.</p>
<p>So I finished the stanza I was translating before I got up.</p>
<p>It took only a moment to reach Emory's door.  I knocked twice and
opened it, just as he growled, "Come in."</p>
<p>"You wanted to see me?"  I sat down quickly to save him the
trouble of offering me a seat.</p>
<p>"That was fast.  What did you do, run?"</p>
<p>I regarded his paternal discontent:</p>
<p><emphasis>Little fatty flecks beneath pale eyes, thinning hair, and an
Irish nose; a voice a decibel louder than anyone else's.....</emphasis></p>
<p>Hamlet to Claudius: "I was working."</p>
<p>"Hah!" he snorted.  "Come off it.  No one's ever seen you do any
of that stuff."</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders and started to rise.</p>
<p>"If that's what you called me down here--"</p>
<p>"Sit down!"</p>
<p>He stood up.  He walked around his desk.  He hovered above me and
glared down.  (A hard trick, even when I'm in a low chair.)</p>
<p>"You are undoubtably the most antagonistic bastard I've ever had
to work with!" he bellowed, like a belly-stung buffalo.  "Why the hell
don't you act like a human being sometime and surprise everybody?  I'm
willing to admit you're smart, maybe even a genius, but--oh, hell!"  He
made a heaving gesture with both hands and walked back to his chair.</p>
<p>"Betty has finally talked them into letting you go in."  His voice
was normal again.  "They'll receive you this afternoon.  Draw one of
the jeepsters after lunch, and get down there."</p>
<p>"Okay," I said.</p>
<p>"That's all, then."</p>
<p>I nodded, got to my feet.  My hand was on the doorknob when he
said:</p>
<p>"I don't have to tell you how important this is.  Don't treat them
the way you treat us."</p>
<p>I closed the door behind me.</p>
<p>I don't remember what I had for lunch.  I was nervous, but I knew
instinctively that I wouldn't muff it.  My Boston publishers expected
a Martian Idyll, or at least a Saint-Exupery job on space flight.  The
National Science Association wanted a complete report on the Rise and
Fall of the Martian Empire.</p>
<p>They would both be pleased.  I knew.</p>
<p>That's the reason everyone is jealous--why they hate me.  I always
come through, and I can come through better than anyone else.</p>
<p>I shoveled in a final anthill of slop, and made my way to our car
barn.  I drew one jeepster and headed it toward Tirellian.</p>
<p>Flames of sand, lousy with iron oxide, set fire to the buggy.
They swarmed over the open top and bit through my scarf; they set to
work pitting my goggles.</p>
<p>The jeepster, swaying and panting like a little donkey I once rode
through the Himalayas, kept kicking me in the seat of the pants.  The
Mountains of Tirellian shuffled their feet and moved toward me at a
cockeyed angle.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was heading uphill, and I shifted gears to accommodate
the engine's braying.  Not like Gobi, not like the Great Southwestern
Desert, I mused.  Just red, just dead...without even a cactus.</p>
<p>I reached the crest of the hill, but I had raised too much dust to
see what was ahead.  It didn't matter, though; I have a head full of
maps.  I bore to the left and downhill, adjusting the throttle.  A
crosswind and solid ground beat down the fires.  I felt like Ulysses
in Malebolge--with a terza-rima speech in one hand and an eye out for
Dante.</p>
<p>I rounded a rock pagoda and arrived.</p>
<p>Betty waved as I crunched to a halt, then jumped down.</p>
<p>"Hi," I choked, unwinding my scarf and shaking out a pound and a
half of grit.  "Like, where do I go and who do I see?"</p>
<p>She permitted herself a brief Germanic giggle--more at my starting
a sentence with "like" than at my discomfort--then she started talking.
(She is a top linguist, so a word from the Village Idiom still tickles
her!)</p>
<p>I appreciate her precise, furry talk; informational, and all that.
I had enough in the way of social pleasantries before me to last at
least the rest of my life.  I looked at her chocolate-bar eyes and
perfect teeth, at her sun-bleached hair, close-cropped to the head (I
hate blondes!), and decided that she was in love with me.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gallinger, the Matriarch is waiting inside for you to be
introduced.  She has consented to open the Temple records for your
study."  She paused here to pat her hair and squirm a little.  Did my
gaze make her nervous?</p>
<p>"They are religious documents, as well as their only history," she
continued, "sort of like the Mahabharata.  She expects you to observe
certain rituals in handling them, like repeating the sacred words when
you turn pages--she will teach you the system."</p>
<p>I nodded quickly, several times.</p>
<p>"Fine, let's go in."</p>
<p>"Uh--"  She paused.  "Do not forget their Eleven Forms of
Politeness and Degree.  They take matters of form quite seriously--and
do not get into any discussions over the equality of the sexes--"</p>
<p>"I know all about their taboos," I broke in.  "Don't worry.  I've
lived in the Orient, remember?"</p>
<p>She dropped her eyes and seized my hand.  I almost jerked it away.</p>
<p>"It will look better if I enter leading you."</p>
<p>I swallowed my comments, and followed her, like Samson in Gaza.</p>
<p>Inside, my last thought met with a strange correspondence.  The
Matriarch's quarters were a rather abstract version of what I might
imagine the tents of the tribes of Israel to have been like.
Abstract, I say, because it was all frescoed brick, peaked like a huge
tent, with animal-skin representations like gray-blue scars, that
looked as if they had been laid on the walls with a palette knife.</p>
<p>The Matriarch, M'Cwyie, was short, white-haired, fifty-ish, and
dressed like a queen.  With her rainbow of voluminous skirts she
looked like an inverted punch bowl set atop a cushion.</p>
<p>Accepting my obeisances, she regarded me as an owl might a rabbit.
The lids of those blank, black eyes jumped upwards as she discovered
my perfect accent. --The tape recorder Betty had carried on her
interviews had done its part, and I knew the language reports from the
first two expeditions, verbatim.  I'm all hell when it comes to
picking up accents.</p>
<p>"You are the poet?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>
<p>"Recite one of your poems, please."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, but nothing short of a thorough translating job would
do justice to your language and my poetry, and I don't know enough of
your language yet."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"But I've been making such translations for my own amusement, as
an exercise in grammar," I continued.  "I'd be honored to bring a few
of them along one of the times that I come here."</p>
<p>"Yes.  Do so."</p>
<p>Score one for me!</p>
<p>She turned to Betty.</p>
<p>"You may go now."</p>
<p>Betty muttered the parting formalities, gave me a strange sideways
look, and was gone.  She apparently had expected to stay and "assist"
me.  She wanted a piece of the glory, like everyone else.  But I was
the Schliemann at this Troy, and there would be only one name on the
Association report!</p>
<p>M'Cwyie rose, and I noticed that she gained very little height by
standing.  But then I'm six-six and look like a poplar in October;
thin, bright red on top, and towering above everyone else.</p>
<p>"Our records are very, very old," she began.  "Betty says that
your word for that age is `millennia.`"</p>
<p>I nodded appreciatively.</p>
<p>"I'm very anxious to see them."</p>
<p>"They are not here.  We will have to go into the Temple--they may
not be removed."</p>
<p>I was suddenly wary.</p>
<p>"You have no objections to my copying them, do you?"</p>
<p>"No.  I see that you respect them, or your desire would not be so
great."</p>
<p>"Excellent."</p>
<p>She seemed amused.  I asked her what was so funny.</p>
<p>"The High Tongue may not be so easy for a foreigner to learn."</p>
<p>It came through fast.</p>
<p>No one on the first expedition had gotten this close.  I had had
no way of knowing that this was a double-language deal--a classical as
well as a vulgar.  I knew some of their Prakrit, now I had to learn
all their Sanskrit.</p>
<p>"Ouch, and damn!"</p>
<p>"Pardon, please?"</p>
<p>"It's non-translatable, M'Cwyie.  But imagine yourself having to
learn the High Tongue in a hurry, and you can guess at the sentiment."</p>
<p>She seemed amused again, and told me to remove my shoes.</p>
<p>She guided me through an alcove...</p>
<p>...and into a burst of Byzantine brilliance!</p>
<p>No Earthman had ever been in this room before, or I would have heard
about it.  Carter, the first expedition's linguist, with the help of
one Mary Allen, M.D., had learned all the grammar and vocabulary that
I knew while sitting cross-legged in the antechamber.</p>
<p>We had had no idea this existed.  Greedily, I cast my eyes about.
A highly sophisticated system of esthetics lay behind the decor.  We
would have to revise our entire estimation of Martian culture.</p>
<p>For one thing, the ceiling was vaulted and corbeled; for another,
there were side-columns with reverse flutings; for another--oh hell!
The place was big.  Posh.  You could never have guessed it from the
shaggy outsides.</p>
<p>I bent forward to study the gilt filigree on a ceremonial table.
M'Cwyie seemed a bit smug at my intentness, but I'd still have hated
to play poker with her.</p>
<p>The table was loaded with books.</p>
<p>With my toe, I traced a mosaic on the floor.</p>
<p>"Is your entire city within this one building?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it goes far back into the mountain."</p>
<p>"I see," I said, seeing nothing.</p>
<p>I couldn't ask her for a conducted tour, yet.</p>
<p>She moved to a small stool by the table.</p>
<p>"Shall we begin your friendship with the High Tongue?"</p>
<p>I was trying to photograph the hall with my eyes, knowing I would
have to get a camera in here, somehow, sooner or later.  I tore my
gaze from a statuette and nodded, hard.</p>
<p>"Yes, introduce me."</p>
<p>I sat down.</p>
<p>For the next three weeks alphabet-bugs chased each other behind my
eyelids whenever I tried to sleep.  The sky was an unclouded pool of
turquoise that rippled calligraphies whenever I swept my eyes across
it.  I drank quarts of coffee while I worked and mixed cocktails of
Benzedrine and champagne for my coffee breaks.</p>
<p>M'Cwyie tutored me two hours every morning, and occasionally for
another two in the evening.  I spent an additional fourteen hours a
day on my own, once I had gotten up sufficient momentum to go ahead
alone.</p>
<p>And at night the elevator of time dropped me to its bottom
floors...</p>
<p>I was six again, learning my Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Aramaic.  I was
ten, sneaking peeks at the <emphasis>Iliad</emphasis>.  When Daddy wasn't spreading
hellfire brimstone, and brotherly love, he was teaching me to dig the
Word, like in the original.</p>
<p>Lord!  There are so many originals and so <emphasis>many</emphasis> words!  When I
was twelve I started pointing out the little differences between what
he was preaching and what I was reading.</p>
<p>The fundamentalist vigor of his reply brooked no debate.  It was
worse than any beating.  I kept my mouth shut after that and learned
to appreciate Old Testament poetry.</p>
<p><emphasis>--Lord, I am sorry!  Daddy--Sir--I am sorry!  --It couldn't be!  It
couldn't be....</emphasis></p>
<p>On the day the boy graduated from high school, with the French,
German, Spanish, and Latin awards, Dad Gallinger had told his
fourteen-year old, six-foot scarecrow of a son that he wanted him to
enter the ministry.  I remember how his son was evasive:</p>
<p>"Sir," he had said, "I'd sort of like to study on my own for a
year or so, and then take pre-theology courses at some liberal arts
university.  I feel I'm still sort of young to try a seminary,
straight off."</p>
<p>The Voice of God: "But you have the gift of tongues, my son.  You
can preach the Gospel in all the lands of Babel.  You were born to be
a missionary.  You say you are young, but time is rushing by you like
a whirlwind.  Start early, and you will enjoy added years of service."</p>
<p>The added years of service were so many added tails to the cat
repeatedly laid on my back.  I can't see his face now; I never can.
Maybe it was because I was always afraid to look at it then.</p>
<p>And years later, when he was dead, and laid out, in black, amidst
bouquets, amidst weeping congregationalists, amidst prayers, red
faces, handkerchiefs, hands patting your shoulders, solemn faced
comforters...I looked at him and did not recognize him.</p>
<p>We had met nine months before my birth, this stranger and I.  He
had never been cruel--stern, demanding, with contempt for everyone's
shortcomings--but never cruel.  He was also all that I had had of a
mother.  And brothers.  And sisters.  He had tolerated my three years
at St. John's, possibly because of its name, never knowing how liberal
and delightful a place it really was.</p>
<p>But I never knew him, and the man atop the catafalque demanded
nothing now; I was free not to preach the Word.  But now I wanted to,
in a different way.  I wanted to preach a word that I never could have
voiced while he lived.</p>
<p>I did not return for my senior year in the fall.  I had a small
inheritance coming, and a bit of trouble getting control of it, since
I was still under eighteen.  But I managed.</p>
<p>It was Greenwich Village I finally settled upon.</p>
<p>Not telling any well-meaning parishioners my new address, I
entered into a daily routine of writing poetry and teaching myself
Japanese and Hindustani.  I grew a fiery beard, drank espresso, and
learned to play chess.  I wanted to try a couple of the other paths to
salvation.</p>
<p>After that, it was two years in India with the Old Peace
Corps--which broke me of my Buddhism, and gave me my <emphasis>Pipes of Krishna</emphasis>
lyrics and the Pulitzer they deserved.</p>
<p>Then back to the States for my degree, grad work in linguistics,
and more prizes.</p>
<p>Then one day a ship went to Mars.  The vessel settling in its New
Mexico nest of fires contained a new language.  --It was fantastic,
exotic, and esthetically overpowering.  After I had learned all there
was to know about it, and written my book, I was famous in new
circles:</p>
<p>"Go, Gallinger.  Dip your bucket in the well, and bring us a drink
of Mars.  Go, learn another world--but remain aloof, rail at it gently
like Auden--and hand us its soul in iambics.</p>
<p>And I came to the land where the sun is a tarnished penny, where
the wind is a whip, where two moons play at hot rod games, and a hell
of sand gives you incendiary itches whenever you look at it.</p>
<p>I rose from my twisting on the bunk and crossed the darkened cabin to
a port.  The desert was a carpet of endless orange, bulging from the
sweepings of centuries beneath it.</p>
<p>"I am a stranger, unafraid--This is the land--I've got it made!"</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>I had the High Tongue by the tail already--or the roots, if you
want your puns anatomical, as well as correct.</p>
<p>The High and Low tongues were not so dissimilar as they had first
seemed.  I had enough of the one to get me through the murkier parts
of the other.  I had the grammar and all the commoner irregular verbs
down cold; the dictionary I was constructing grew by the day, like a
tulip, and would bloom shortly.  Every time I played the tapes the
stem lengthened.</p>
<p>Now was the time to tax my ingenuity, to really drive the lessons
home.  I had purposely refrained from plunging into the major texts
until I could do justice to them.  I had been reading minor
commentaries, bits of verse, fragments of history.  And one thing had
impressed me strongly in all that I read.</p>
<p>They wrote about concrete things: rock, sand, water, winds; and
the tenor couched within these elemental symbols was fiercely
pessimistic.  It reminded me of some Buddhists texts, but even more
so, I realized from my recent <emphasis>recherches</emphasis>, it was like parts of the
Old Testament.  Specifically, it reminded me of the Book of
Ecclesiastes.</p>
<p>That, then, would be it.  The sentiment, as well as the
vocabulary, was so similar that it would be a perfect exercise.  Like
putting Poe into French.  I would never be a convert to the Way of
Malann, but I would show them that an Earthman had once thought the
same thoughts, felt similarly.</p>
<p>I switched on my desk lamp and sought King James amidst my books.</p>
<p><emphasis>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all
if vanity.  What profit hath a man...</emphasis></p>
<p>My progress seemed to startle M'Cwyie.  She peered at me, like
Sartre's Other, across the tabletop.  I ran through a chapter in the
Book of Locar.  I didn't look up, but I could feel the tight net her
eyes were working about my head, shoulders, and rapid hands.  I turned
another page.</p>
<p>Was she weighing the net, judging the size of the catch?  And what
for?  The books said nothing of fishers on Mars.  Especially of men.
They said that some god named Malann had spat, or had done something
disgusting (depending on the version you read), and that life had
gotten underway as a disease in inorganic matter.  They said that
movement was its first law, its first law, and that the dance was the
only legitimate reply to the inorganic...the dance's quality its
justification,--fication...and love is a disease in organic
matter--Inorganic matter?</p>
<p>I shook my head.  I had almost been asleep.</p>
<p>"M'narra."</p>
<p>I stood and stretched.  Her eyes outlined me greedily now.  So I
met them, and they dropped.</p>
<p>"I grow tired.  I want to rest for awhile.  I didn't sleep much
last night."</p>
<p>She nodded, Earth's shorthand for "yes," as she had learned from
me.</p>
<p>"You wish to relax, and see the explicitness of the doctrine of
Locar in its fullness?"</p>
<p>"Pardon me?"</p>
<p>"You wish to see a Dance of Locar?"</p>
<p>"Oh."  Their damned circuits of form and periphrasis here ran
worse than the Korean!  "Yes. Surely.  Any time it's going to be done
I'd be happy to watch."</p>
<p>I continued, "In the meantime, I've been meaning to ask you
whether I might take some pictures-"</p>
<p>"Now is the time.  Sit down.  Rest.  I will call the musicians."</p>
<p>She bustled out through a door I had never been past.</p>
<p>Well now, the dance was the highest art, according to Locar, not
to mention Havelock Ellis, and I was about to see how their
centuries-dead philosopher felt it should be conducted.  I rubbed my
eyes and snapped over, touching my toes a few times.</p>
<p>The blood began pounding in my head, and I sucked in a couple deep
breaths.  I bent again and there was a flurry of motion at the door.</p>
<p>To the trio who entered with M'Cwyie I must have looked as if I
were searching for the marbles I had just lost, bent over like that.</p>
<p>I grinned weakly and straightened up, my face red from more than
exertion.  I hadn't expected them <emphasis>that</emphasis> quickly.</p>
<p>Suddenly I thought of Havelock Ellis again in his area of greatest
popularity.</p>
<p>The little redheaded doll, wearing, sari-like, a diaphanous piece
of the Martian sky, looked up in wonder--as a child at some colorful
flag on a high pole.</p>
<p>"Hello," I said, or its equivalent.</p>
<p>She bowed before replying.  Evidently I had been promoted in
status.</p>
<p>"I shall dance," said the red wound in that pale, pale cameo, her
face.  Eyes, the color of dream and her dress, pulled away from mine.</p>
<p>She drifted to the center of the room.</p>
<p>Standing there, like a figure in an Etruscan frieze, she was
either meditating or regarding the design on the floor.</p>
<p>Was the mosaic symbolic of something?  I studied it.  If it was,
it eluded me; it would make an attractive bathroom floor or patio, but
I couldn't see much in it beyond that.</p>
<p>The other two were paint-spattered sparrows like M'Cwyie, in their
middle years.  One settled to the floor with a triple-stringed
instrument faintly resembling a <emphasis>samisen</emphasis>.  The other held a simple
woodblock and two drumsticks.</p>
<p>M'Cwyie disdained her stool and was seated upon the floor before I
realized it.  I followed suit.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>samisen</emphasis> player was still tuning it up, so I leaned toward
M'Cwyie.</p>
<p>"What is the dancer's name?"</p>
<p>"Braxa," she replied, without looking at me, and raised her left
hand, slowly, which meant yes, and go ahead, and let it begin.</p>
<p>The stringed-thing throbbed like a toothache, and a tick-tocking,
like ghosts of all the clocks they had never invented, sprang from the
block.</p>
<p>Braxa was a statue, both hands raised to her face, elbows high and
outspread.</p>
<p>The music became a metaphor for fire.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crackle, purr, snap...</emphasis></p>
<p>She did not move.</p>
<p>The hissing altered to splashes.  The cadence slowed.  It was
water now, the most precious thing in the world, gurgling clear then
green over mossy rocks.</p>
<p>Still she did not move.</p>
<p>Glissandos.  A pause.</p>
<p>Then, so faint I could hardly be sure at first, the tremble of
winds began.  Softly, gently, sighing and halting, uncertain.  A
pause, a sob, then a repetition of the first statement, only louder,</p>
<p>Were my eyes completely bugged from my reading, or was Braxa
actually trembling, all over, head to foot.</p>
<p>She was.</p>
<p>She began a microscopic swaying.  A fraction of an inch right,
then left.  Her fingers opened like the petals of a flower, and I
could see that her eyes were closed.</p>
<p>Her eyes opened.  They were distant, glassy, looking through me
and the walls.  Her swaying became more pronounced, merged with the
beat.</p>
<p><emphasis>The wind was sweeping in from the desert now, falling against
Tirellian like waves on a dike.</emphasis>  Her fingers moved, they were the
gusts.  Her arms, slow pendulums, descended, began a counter-movement.</p>
<p><emphasis>The gale was coming now.</emphasis>  She began an axial movement and her
hands caught up with the rest of her body, only now her shoulders
commenced to writhe out a figure-eight.</p>
<p><emphasis>The wind!  The wind, I say.  O wild, enigmatic!  O muse of St.
John Perse!</emphasis></p>
<p>The cyclone was twisting around those eyes, its still center.  Her
head was thrown back, but I knew there was no ceiling between her
gaze, passive as Buddha's, and the unchanging skies.  Only the two
moons, perhaps, interrupted their slumber in that elemental Nirvana of
uninhabited turquoise.</p>
<p>Years ago, I had seen the Devadasis is India, the street-dancers,
spinning their colorful webs, drawing in the male insect.  But Braxa
was more than this: she was a Ramadjany, like those votaries of Rama,
incarnation of Vishnu, who had given the dance to man: the sacred
dancers.</p>
<p>The clicking was monotonously steady now; the whine of the strings
made me think of the stinging rays of the sun, their heat stolen by
the wind's halations; the blue was Sarasvati and Mary, and a girl
named Laura.  I heard a sitar from somewhere, watched this statue come
to life, and inhaled a divine afflatus.</p>
<p>I was again Rimbaud with his hashish, Baudelaire with his
laudanum, Poe, De Quincy, Wilde, Mallarme and Aleister Crowley.  I
was, for a fleeting second, my father in his dark pulpit and darker
suit, the hymns and the organ's wheeze transmuted to bright wind.</p>
<p>She was a spun weather vane, a feathered crucifix hovering in the
air. a clothes-line holding one bright garment lashed parallel to the
ground.  Her shoulder was bare now, and her right breast moved up and
down like a moon in the sky, its red nipple appearing momentarily
above a fold and vanishing again.  The music was as formal as Job's
argument with God.  Her dance was God's reply.</p>
<p>The music slowed, settled; it had been met, matched, answered.
Her garment, as if alive, crept back into the more sedate folds it
originally held.</p>
<p>She dropped low, lower, to the floor.  Her head fell upon her
raised knees.  She did not move.</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>I realized, from the ache across my shoulders, how tensely I had been
sitting.  My armpits were wet.  Rivulets had been running down my
sides.  What did one do now?  Applaud?</p>
<p>I sought M'Cwyie from the corner of my eye.  She raised her right
hand.</p>
<p>As if by telepathy the girl shuddered all over and stood.  The
musicians also rose.  So did M'Cwyie.</p>
<p>I got to my feet, with a Charley Horse in my left leg, and said,
"It was beautiful," inane as that sounds.</p>
<p>I received three different High Forms of "thank you."</p>
<p>There was a flurry of color and I was alone again with M'Cwyie.</p>
<p>"That is the one hundred-seventeenth of the two thousand, two
hundred-twenty-four danced of Locar."</p>
<p>I looked down at her.</p>
<p>"Whether Locar was right or wrong, he worked out a fine reply to
the inorganic."</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>"Are the dances of your world like this?"</p>
<p>"Some of them are similar.  I was reminded of them as I watched
Braxa-but I've never seen anything exactly like hers."</p>
<p>"She is good," M'Cwyie said.  "She knows all the dances."</p>
<p>A hint of her earlier expression which had troubled me...</p>
<p>It was gone in an instant.</p>
<p>"I must tend my duties now."  She moved to the table and closed
the books.  "M'narra."</p>
<p>"Good-bye."  I slipped into my boots.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, Gallinger."</p>
<p>I walked out the door, mounted the jeepster, and roared across the
evening into night, my wings of risen desert flapping slowly behind
me.</p>

<title><p>II</p></title>


<p>I had just closed the door behind Betty, after a brief grammar
session, when I heard the voices in the hall.  My vent was opened a
fraction, so I stood there and eavesdropped;</p>
<p>Morton's fruity treble: "Guess what?  He said `hello' to me awhile
ago."</p>
<p>"Hmmph!"  Emory's elephant lungs exploded.  "Either he's slipping,
or you were standing in his way and he wanted you to move."</p>
<p>"Probably didn't recognize me.  I don't think he sleeps any more,
now he has that language to play with.  I had night watch last week,
and every night I passed his door at 0300--I always heard that recorder
going.  At 0500 when I got off, he was still at it."</p>
<p>"The guy <emphasis>is</emphasis> working hard," Emory admitted, grudgingly.  "In
fact, I think he's taking some kind of dope to keep awake.  He looks
sort of glassy-eyed these days.  Maybe that's natural for a poet,
though."</p>
<p>Betty had been standing there, because she broke in then:</p>
<p>"Regardless of what you think of him, it's going to take me at
least a year to learn what he's picked up in three weeks.  And I'm
just a linguist, not a poet."</p>
<p>Morton must have been nursing a crush on her bovine charms.  It's
the only reason I can think of for his dropping his guns to say what
he did.</p>
<p>"I took a course in modern poetry when I was back at the
university," he began.  "We read six authors--Yeats, Pound, Eliot,
Crane, Stevens, and Gallinger--and on the last day of the semester,
when the prof was feeling a little rhetorical, he said, `These six
names are written on the century, and all the gates of criticism and
hell shall not prevail on them.'</p>
<p>"Myself," he continued, "I thought his <emphasis>Pipes of Krishna</emphasis> and his
<emphasis>Madrigals</emphasis> were great.  I was honored to be chosen for an expedition
he was going on.</p>
<p>"I think he's spoken two dozen words to me since I met him," he
finished.</p>
<p>The Defense: "Did it ever occur to you," Betty said, "that he
might be tremendously self-conscious about his appearance?  He was
also a precocious child, and probably never even had school friends.
He's sensitive and very introverted."</p>
<p>"Sensitive?  Self-conscious?"  Emory choked and gagged.  "The man
is as proud as Lucifer, and he's a walking insult machine.  You press
a button like `Hello' or `Nice day' and he thumbs his nose at you.
He's got it down to a reflex."</p>
<p>They muttered a few other pleasantries and drifted away.</p>
<p>Well bless you, Morton boy.  You little pimple-faced, Ivy-bred
connoisseur!  I've never taken a course in my poetry, but I'm glad
someone said that.  The Gates of Hell.  Well now!  Maybe Daddy's
prayers got heard somewhere, and I am a missionary, after all!</p>
<p>Only...</p>
<p>...Only a missionary needs something to convert people <emphasis>to</emphasis>.  I
have my private system of esthetics, and I suppose it oozes an ethical
by-product somewhere.  But if I ever had anything to preach, really,
even in my poems, I wouldn't care to preach it to such low-lifes as
you.  If you think I'm a slob, I'm also a snob, and there's no room
for you in my Heaven--it's a private place, where Swift, Shaw, and
Petronius Arbiter come to dinner.</p>
<p>And oh, the feasts we have!  The Trimalchio's, the Emory's we
dissect!</p>
<p>We finish you with the soup, Morton!</p>
<p>I turned and settled at my desk.  I wanted to write something.
Ecclesiastes could take a night off.  I wanted to write a poem, a poem
about the one hundred-seventeenth dance of Locar; about a rose
following the light, traced by the wind, sick, like Blake's rose,
dying...</p>
<p>I found a pencil and began.</p>
<p>When I had finished I was pleased.  It wasn't great--at least, it
was no greater than it needed to be--High Martian not being my
strongest tongue.  I groped, and put it into English, with partial
rhymes.  Maybe I'd stick it in my next book.  I called it <emphasis>Braxa:</emphasis></p>
<cite><p>In a land of wind and red, where the icy evening of Time</p>
<p>freezes milk in the breasts of Life, as two moons overhead--</p>
<p>cat and dog in alleyways of dream--scratch and scramble</p>
<p>agelessly my flight...</p>
<p>This final flower turns a burning head.</p></cite>
<p>I put it away and found some phenobarbitol.  I was suddenly tired.</p>
<p>When I showed my poem to M'Cwyie the next day, she read it through
several times, very slowly.</p>
<p>"It is lovely," she said.  "But you used three words from your own
language.  `Cat' and `dog', I assume, are two small animals with a
hereditary hatred for one another.  But what is `flower'?"</p>
<p>"Oh," I said.  "I've never come across your word for `flower', but
I was actually thinking of an Earth flower, the rose."</p>
<p>"What is it like?"</p>
<p>"Well, its petals are generally bright red.  That's what I meant,
on one level, by `burning heads.'  I also wanted it to imply fever,
though, and red hair, and the fire of life.  The rose, itself, has a
thorny stem, green leaves, and a distinct, pleasing aroma."</p>
<p>"I wish I could see one."</p>
<p>"I suppose it could be arranged.  I'll check."</p>
<p>"Do it, please.  You are a--"  She used the word for "prophet," or
religious poet, like Isaias or Locar.  "--and your poem is inspired.  I
shall tell Braxa of it."</p>
<p>I declined the nomination, but felt flattered.</p>
<p>This, then, I decided, was the strategic day, the day on which to
ask whether I might bring in the microfilm machine and the camera.  I
wanted to copy all their texts, I explained, and I couldn't write fast
enough to do it.</p>
<p>She surprised me by agreeing immediately.  But she bowled me over
with her invitation.</p>
<p>"Would you like to come and stay here while you do this thing?
Then you can work day and night, any time you want--except when the
Temple is being used, of course."</p>
<p>I bowed.</p>
<p>"I should be honored."</p>
<p>"Good.  Bring your machines when you want, and I will show you a
room."</p>
<p>"Will this afternoon be all right?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"Then I will go now and get things ready.  Until this
afternoon..."</p>
<p>"Good-bye."</p>
<p>I anticipated a little trouble from Emory, but not much.  Everyone
back at the ship was anxious to see the Martians, poke needles in the
Martians, ask them about Martian climate, diseases, soil chemistry,
politics, and mushrooms (our botanist was a fungus nut, but a
reasonably good guy)--and only four or five had actually gotten to see
them.  The crew had been spending most of its time excavating dead
cities and their acropolises.  We played the game by strict rules, and
the natives were as fiercely insular as the nineteenth-century
Japanese.  I figured I would meet with little resistance, and I
figured right.</p>
<p>In fact, I got the distinct impression that everyone was happy to
see me move out.</p>
<p>I stopped in the hydroponics room to speak with our mushroom
master.</p>
<p>"Hi, Kane.  Grow any toadstools in the sand yet?"</p>
<p>He sniffed.  He always sniffs.  Maybe he's allergic to plants.</p>
<p>"Hello, Gallinger.  No, I haven't had any success with toadstools,
but look behind the car barn next time you're out there.  I've got a
few cacti going."</p>
<p>"Great," I observed.  Doc Kane was about my only friend aboard,
not counting Betty.</p>
<p>"Say, I came down to ask you a favor."</p>
<p>"Name it."</p>
<p>"I want a rose."</p>
<p>"A what?"</p>
<p>"A rose.  You know, a nice red American Beauty job--thorns, pretty
smelling--"</p>
<p>"I don't think it will take in this soil.  <emphasis>Sniff, sniff.</emphasis>"</p>
<p>"No, you don't understand.  I don't want to plant it, I just want
the flower."</p>
<p>"I'd have to use the tanks."  He scratched his hairless dome.  "It
would take at least three months to get you flowers, even under forced
growth."</p>
<p>"Will you do it?"</p>
<p>"Sure, if you don't mind the wait."</p>
<p>"Not at all.  In fact, three months will just make it before we
leave."      I looked about at the pools of crawling slime, at the trays
of shoots.  "--I'm moving up to Tirellian today, but I'll be in and out
all the time.  I'll be here when it blooms."</p>
<p>"Moving up there, eh?  Moore said they're an in-group."</p>
<p>"I guess I'm `in' then."</p>
<p>"Looks that way--I still don't see how you learned their language,
though.  Of course, I had trouble with French and German for my Ph.D,
but last week I heard Betty demonstrate it at lunch.  It just sounds
like a lot of weird noises.  She says speaking it is like working a
<emphasis>Times</emphasis> crossword and trying to imitate birdcalls at the same time."</p>
<p>I laughed, and took the cigarette he offered me.</p>
<p>"It's complicated," I acknowledged.  "But, well, it's as if you
suddenly came across a whole new class of mycetae here--you'd dream
about it at night."</p>
<p>His eyes were gleaming.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't that be something!  I might, yet, you know."</p>
<p>"Maybe you will."</p>
<p>He chuckled as we walked to the door.</p>
<p>"I'll start your roses tonight.  Take it easy down there."</p>
<p>"You bet.  Thanks."</p>
<p>Like I said, a fungus nut, but a fairly good guy.</p>
<p>My quarters in the Citadel of Tirellian were directly adjacent to the
Temple, on the inward side and slightly to the left.  They were a
considerable improvement over my cramped cabin, and I was pleased that
Martian culture had progressed sufficiently to discover the
desirability of the mattress over the pallet.  Also, the bed was long
enough to accommodate me, which was surprising.</p>
<p>So I unpacked and took sixteen 35 mm. shots of the Temple, before
starting on the books.</p>
<p>I took 'stats until I was sick of turning pages without knowing
what they said.  So I started translating a work of history.</p>
<p>"Lo.  In the thirty-seventh year of the Process of Cillen the rains
came, which gave way to rejoicing, for it was a rare and untoward
occurrence, and commonly construed a blessing.</p>
<p>"But it was not the life-giving semen of Malann which fell from
the heavens.  It was the blood of the universe, spurting from an
artery.  And the last days were upon us.  The final dance was to
begin.</p>
<p>"The rains brought the plague that does not kill, and the last
passes of Locar began with their drumming...."</p>
<p>I asked myself what the hell Tamur meant, for he was an historian
and supposedly committed to fact.  This was not their Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Unless they could be one and the same...?</p>
<p>Why not? I mused.  Tirellian's handful of people were the remnant
of what had obviously once been a highly developed culture.  They had
had wars, but no holocausts; science, but little technology.  A
plague, a plague that did not kill...?  Could that have done it?  How,
if it wasn't fatal?</p>
<p>I read on, but the nature of the plague was not discussed.  I
turned pages, skipped ahead, and drew a blank.</p>
<p><emphasis>M'Cwyie!  M'Cwyie!  When I want to question you most, you are not
around!</emphasis></p>
<p>Would it be a <emphasis>faux pas</emphasis> to go looking for her?  Yes, I decided.
I was restricted to the rooms I had been shown, that had been an
implicit understanding.  I would have to wait to find out.</p>
<p>So I cursed long and loud, in many languages, doubtless burning
Malann's sacred ears, there in his Temple.</p>
<p>He did not see fit to strike me dead, so I decided to call it a
day and hit the sack.</p>
<p>I must have been asleep for several hours when Braxa entered my room
with a tiny lamp.  She dragged me awake by tugging at my pajama
sleeve.</p>
<p>I said hello.  Thinking back, there is not much else I could have
said.</p>
<p>"Hello."</p>
<p>"I have come," she said, "to hear the poem."</p>
<p>"What poem?"</p>
<p>"Yours."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>I yawned, sat up, and did things people usually do when awakened
in the middle of the night to read poetry.</p>
<p>"That is very kind of you, but isn't the hour a trifle awkward?"</p>
<p>"I don't mind," she said.</p>
<p>Someday I am going to write an article for the <emphasis>Journal of
Semantics</emphasis>, called "Tone of Voice: An Insufficient Vehicle for Irony."</p>
<p>However, I was awake, so I grabbed my robe.</p>
<p>"What sort of animal is that? she asked, pointing at the silk
dragon on my lapel.</p>
<p>"Mythical," I replied.  "Now look, it's late.  I am tired.  I have
much to do in the morning.  And M'Cwyie just might get the wrong idea
if she learns you were here."</p>
<p>"Wrong idea?"</p>
<p>"You know damned well what I mean!"  It was the first time I had
had an opportunity to use Martian profanity, and it failed.</p>
<p>"No," she said, "I do not know."</p>
<p>She seemed frightened, like a puppy dog being scolded without
knowing what it has done wrong.</p>
<p>I softened.  Her red cloak matched her hair and lips so perfectly,
and those lips were trembling.</p>
<p>"Here now, I didn't mean to upset you.  On my world there are
certain, uh, mores, concerning people of different sex alone together
in bedrooms, and not allied by marriage....Um, I mean, you see what I
mean?"</p>
<p>They were jade, her eyes.</p>
<p>"Well, it's sort of...Well, it's sex, that's what it is."</p>
<p>A light was switched on in those jade eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean having children!"</p>
<p>"Yes.  That's it!  Exactly!"</p>
<p>She laughed.  It was the first time I had heard laughter in
Tirellian.  It sounded like a violinist striking his high strings with
the bow, in short little chops.  It was not an altogether pleasant
thing to hear, especially because she laughed too long.</p>
<p>When she had finished she moved closer.</p>
<p>"I remember, now," she said.  "We used to have such rules.  Half a
Process ago, when I was a child, we had such rules.  But--" she looked
as if she were ready to laugh again--"there is no need for them now."</p>
<p>My mind moved like a tape recorder playing at triple speed.</p>
<p>Half a Process!  HalfaProcessa--ProcessaProcess!  No!  Yes!  Half a
Process was two hundred-forty-three years, roughly speaking!</p>
<p>--Time enough to learn the 2224 dances of Locar.</p>
<p>--Time enough to grow old, if you were human.</p>
<p>--Earth-style human, I mean.</p>
<p>I looked at her again, pale as the white queen in an ivory chess
set.</p>
<p>She was human, I'd stake my soul--alive, normal, healthy.  I'd
stake my life--woman, my body...</p>
<p>But she was two and a half centuries old, which made M'Cwyie
Methusala's grandma.  It flattered me to think of their repeated
complimenting of my skills, as linguist, as poet.  These superior
beings!</p>
<p>But what did she mean "there is no such need for them now"?  Why
the near-hysteria?  Why all those funny looks I'd been getting from
M'Cwyie?</p>
<p>I suddenly knew I was close to something important, besides a
beautiful girl.</p>
<p>"Tell me," I said, in my Casual Voice, "did it have anything to do
with `the plague that does not kill,' of which Tamur wrote?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied, "the children born after the Rains could have
no children of their own, and--"</p>
<p>"And what?" I was leaning forward, memory set at "record."</p>
<p>"--and the men had no desire to get any."</p>
<p>I sagged backward against the bedpost.  Racial sterility,
masculine impotence, following phenomenal weather.  Had some vagabond
cloud of radioactive junk from God knows where penetrated their weak
atmosphere one day?  One day long before Shiaparelli saw the canals,
mythical as my dragon, before those "canals" had given rise to some
correct guesses for all the wrong reasons, had Braxa been alive,
dancing, here--damned in the womb since blind Milton had written of
another paradise, equally lost?</p>
<p>I found a cigarette.  Good thing I had thought to bring ashtrays.
Mars had never had a tobacco industry either.  Or booze.  The ascetics
I had met in India had been Dionysiac compared to this.</p>
<p>"What is that tube of fire?"</p>
<p>"A cigarette.  Want one?"</p>
<p>"Yes, please."</p>
<p>She sat beside me, and I lighted it for her.</p>
<p>"It irritates the nose."</p>
<p>"Yes.  Draw some into your lungs, hold it there, and exhale."</p>
<p>A moment passed.</p>
<p>"Ooh," she said.</p>
<p>A pause, then, "Is it sacred?"</p>
<p>"No, it's nicotine," I answered, "a very <emphasis>ersatz</emphasis> form of
divinity."</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>"Please don't ask me to translate `ersatz'."</p>
<p>"I won't.  I get this feeling sometimes when I dance."</p>
<p>"It will pass in a moment."</p>
<p>"Tell me your poem now."</p>
<p>An idea hit me.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," I said.  "I may have something better."</p>
<p>I got up and rummaged through my notebooks, then I returned and
sat beside her.</p>
<p>"These are the first three chapters of the Book of Ecclesiastes,"
I explained.  "It is very similar to your own sacred books."</p>
<p>I started reading.</p>
<p>I got through eleven verses before she cried out, "Please don't
read that!  Tell me one of yours!"</p>
<p>I stopped and tossed the notebook onto a nearby table.  She was
shaking, not as she had quivered that day she danced as the wind, but
with the jitter of unshed tears.  She held her cigarette awkwardly,
like a pencil.  Clumsily, I put my arm about her shoulders.</p>
<p>"He is so sad," she said, "like all the others."</p>
<p>So I twisted my mind like a bright ribbon, folded it, and tied the
crazy Christmas knots I love so well.  From German to Martian, with
love, I did an impromptu paraphrasal of a poem about a Spanish dancer.
I thought it would please her.  I was right.</p>
<p>"Ooh," she said again.  "Did you write that?"</p>
<p>"No, it's by a better man than I."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it.  You wrote it yourself."</p>
<p>"No, a man named Rilke did."</p>
<p>"But you brought it across to my language.  Light another match,
so I can see how she danced."</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>"The fires of forever," she mused, "and she stamped them out,
`with small, firm feet.'  I wish I could dance like that."</p>
<p>"You're better than any Gypsy," I laughed, blowing it out.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not.  I couldn't do that."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to dance for you?"</p>
<p>Her cigarette was burning down, so I removed it from her fingers
and put it out, along with my own.</p>
<p>"No," I said.  "Go to bed."</p>
<p>She smiled, and before I realized it, had unclasped the fold of
red at her shoulder.</p>
<p>And everything fell away.</p>
<p>And I swallowed, with some difficulty.</p>
<p>"All right," she said.</p>
<p>So I kissed her, as the breath of fallen cloth extinguished the
lamp.</p>

<title><p>III</p></title>


<p>The days were like Shelley's leaves: yellow, red, brown, whipped
in bright gusts by the west wind.  They swirled past me with the
rattle of microfilm.  Almost all of the books were recorded now.  It
would take scholars years to get through them, to properly assess
their value.  Mars was locked in my desk.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes, abandoned and returned to a dozen times, was almost
ready to speak in the High Tongue.</p>
<p>I whistled when I wasn't in the Temple.  I wrote reams of poetry I
would have been ashamed of before.  Evenings I would walk with Braxa,
across the dunes or up into the mountains.  Sometimes she would dance
for me; and I would read something long, and in dactylic hexameter.
She still thought I was Rilke, and I almost kidded myself into
believing it.  Here I was, staying at the Caste Duino, writing his
<emphasis>Elegies</emphasis>.</p>
<cite><p>...It is strange to inhabit the Earth no more,</p>
<p>to use no longer customs scarce acquired,</p>
<p>nor interpret roses...</p></cite>
<p>No!  Never interpret roses!  Don't.  Smell them (sniff, Kane!),
pick them, enjoy them.  Live in the moment.  Hold to it tightly.  but
charge not the gods to explain.  So fast the leaves go by, are
blown...</p>
<p>And no one ever noticed us.  Or cared.</p>
<p>Laura.  Laura and Braxa.  They rhyme, you know, with a bit of
clash.  Tall, cool, and blonde was she (I hate blondes!), and Daddy
had turned me inside out, like a pocket, and I thought she could fill
me again.  But the big, beat work-slinger, with Judas-beard and
dog-trust in his eyes, oh, he had been a fine decoration at her
parties.  And that was all.</p>
<p>How the machine cursed me in the Temple!  It blasphemed Malann and
Gallinger.  And the wild west wind went by and something was not far
behind.</p>
<p>The last days were upon us.</p>
<p>A day went by and I did not see Braxa, and a night.</p>
<p>And a second.  And a third.</p>
<p>I was half-mad.  I hadn't realized how close we had become, how
important she had been.  With the dumb assurance of presence, I had
fought against questioning the roses.</p>
<p>I had to ask.  I didn't want to, but I had no choice.</p>
<p>"Where is she, M'Cwyie?  Where is Braxa?"</p>
<p>"She is gone," she said.</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"I do not know."</p>
<p>I looked at those devil-bird eyes.  Anathema maranatha rose to my
lips.</p>
<p>"I must know."</p>
<p>She looked through me.</p>
<p>"She has left us.  She is gone.  Up into the hills, I suppose.  Or
the desert.  It does not matter.  What does anything matter?  The
dance draws itself to a close.  The Temple will soon be empty."</p>
<p>"Why?  Why did she leave?"</p>
<p>"I do not know."</p>
<p>"I must see her again.  We lift off in a matter of days."</p>
<p>"I am sorry, Gallinger."</p>
<p>"So am I," I said, and slammed shut a book without saying
"m'narra."</p>
<p>I stood up.</p>
<p>"I will find her."</p>
<p>I left the Temple.  M'Cwyie was a seated statue.  My boots were
still where I had left them.</p>
<p>All day I roared up and down the dunes, going nowhere.  To the crew of
the <emphasis>Aspic</emphasis> I must have looked like a sandstorm, all by myself.
Finally, I had to return for more fuel.</p>
<p>Emory came stalking out.</p>
<p>"Okay, make it good.  You look like the abominable dust man.  Why
the rodeo?"</p>
<p>"Why, I, uh, lost something."</p>
<p>"In the middle of the desert?  Was it one of your sonnets?
They're the only thing I can think of that you'd make such a fuss
over."</p>
<p>"No, dammit!  It was something personal."</p>
<p>George had finished filling the tank.  I started to mount the
jeepster again.</p>
<p>"Hold on there!" he grabbed my arm.</p>
<p>"You're not going back until you tell me what this is all about."</p>
<p>I could have broken his grip, but then he could order me dragged
back by the heels, and quite a few people would enjoy doing the
dragging.  So I forced myself to speak slowly, softly:</p>
<p>"It's simply that I lost my watch.  My mother gave it to me and
it's a family heirloom.  I want to find it before we leave."</p>
<p>"You sure it's not in your cabin, or down in Tirellian?"</p>
<p>"I've already checked."</p>
<p>"Maybe somebody hid it to irritate you.  You know you're not the
most popular guy around."</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"I thought of that.  But I always carry it in my right pocket.  I
think it might have bounced out going over the dunes."</p>
<p>He narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>"I remember reading on a book jacket that your mother died when
you were born."</p>
<p>"That's right," I said, biting my tongue.  "The watch belonged to
her father and she wanted me to have it.  My father kept it for me."</p>
<p>"Hmph!" he snorted.  "That's a pretty strange way to look for a
watch, riding up and down in a jeepster."</p>
<p>"I could see the light shining off it that way," I offered,
lamely.</p>
<p>"Well, it's starting to get dark," he observed.  "No sense looking
any more today.</p>
<p>"Throw a dust sheet over the jeepster," he directed a mechanic.</p>
<p>He patted my arm.</p>
<p>"Come on in and get a shower, and something to eat.  You look as
if you could use both."</p>
<p><emphasis>Little fatty flecks beneath pale eyes, thinning hair, and an
Irish nose; a voice a decibel louder than anyone else's...</emphasis></p>
<p>His only qualification for leadership!</p>
<p>I stood there, hating him.  Claudius!  If only this were the fifth
act!</p>
<p>But suddenly the idea of a shower, and food, came through to me.
I could use both badly.  If I insisted on hurrying back immediately I
might arouse more suspicion.</p>
<p>So I brushed some sand from my sleeve.</p>
<p>"You're right.  That sounds like a good idea."</p>
<p>"Come on, we'll eat in my cabin."</p>
<p>The shower was a blessing, clean khakis were the grace of God,
and the food smelled like Heaven.</p>
<p>"Smells pretty good," I said.</p>
<p>We hacked up our steaks in silence.  When we got to the dessert
and coffee he suggested:</p>
<p>"Why don't you take the night off?  Stay here and get some sleep."</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty busy.  Finishing up.  There's not much time left."</p>
<p>"A couple of days ago you said you were almost finished."</p>
<p>"Almost, but not quite."</p>
<p>"You also said they're be holding a service in the Temple
tonight."</p>
<p>"That's right.  I'm going to work in my room."</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>Finally, he said, "Gallinger," and I looked up because my name
means trouble.</p>
<p>"It shouldn't be any of my business," he said, "but it is.  Betty
says you have a girl down there."</p>
<p>There was no question mark.  It was a statement hanging in the
air.  Waiting.</p>
<p><emphasis>Betty, you're a bitch.  You're a cow and a bitch.  And a jealous
one, at that.  Why didn't you keep your nose where it belonged, shut
your eyes?  You mouth?</emphasis></p>
<p>"So?" I said, a statement with a question mark.</p>
<p>"So," he answered it, "it is my duty, as head of this expedition,
to see that relations with the natives are carried on in a friendly,
and diplomatic, manner."</p>
<p>"You speak of them," I said, "as though they are aborigines.
Nothing could be further from the truth."</p>
<p>I rose.</p>
<p>"When my papers are published everyone on Earth will know that
truth.  I'll tell them things Doctor Moore never even guessed at.
I'll tell the tragedy of a doomed race, waiting for death, resigned
and disinterested.  I'll write about it, and they will give me more
prizes, and this time I won't want them.</p>
<p>"My God!" I exclaimed.  "They had a culture when our ancestors
were clubbing the saber-tooth and finding out how fire works!"</p>
<p>"<emphasis>Do</emphasis> you have a girl down there?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" I said.  Yes, <emphasis>Claudius!  Yes, Daddy!  Yes, Emory!</emphasis>  "I do.
but I'm going to let you in on a scholarly scoop now.  They're already
dead.  They're sterile.  In one more generation there won't be any
Martians."</p>
<p>I paused, then added, "Except in my papers, except on a few pieces
of microfilm and tape.  And in some poems, about a girl who did give a
damn and could only bitch about the unfairness of it all by dancing."</p>
<p>"Oh," he said.</p>
<p>After awhile:</p>
<p>"You <emphasis>have</emphasis> been behaving differently these past couple months.
You've even been downright civil on occasion, you know.  I couldn't
help wondering what was happening.  I didn't know anything mattered
that strongly to you."</p>
<p>I bowed my head.</p>
<p>"Is she the reason you were racing around the desert?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>I looked up.</p>
<p>"Because she's out there, somewhere.  I don't know where, or why.
And I've got to find her before we go."</p>
<p>"Oh," he said again.</p>
<p>Then he leaned back, opened a drawer, and took out something
wrapped in a towel.  He unwound it.  A framed photo of a woman lay on
the table.</p>
<p>"My wife," he said.</p>
<p>It was an attractive face, with big, almond eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm a Navy man, you know," he began.  "Young officer once.  Met
her in Japan."</p>
<p>"Where I come from it wasn't considered right to marry into
another race, so we never did.  But she was my wife.  When she died I
was on the other side of the world.  They took my children, and I've
never seen them since.  I couldn't learn what orphanage, what home,
they were put into.  That was long ago.  Very few people know about
it."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," I said.</p>
<p>"Don't be.  Forget it.  But"--he shifted in his chair and looked at
me--"if you do want to take her back with you--do it.  It'll mean my
neck, but I'm too old to ever head another expedition like this one.
So go ahead."</p>
<p>He gulped cold coffee.</p>
<p>"Get your jeepster."</p>
<p>He swiveled the chair around.</p>
<p>I tried to say "thank you" twice, but I couldn't.  So I got up and
walked out.</p>
<p>"Sayonara, and all that," he muttered behind me.</p>
<p>"Here it is, Gallinger!" I heard a shout.</p>
<p>I turned on my heel and looked back up the ramp.</p>
<p>"Kane!"</p>
<p>He was limned in the port, shadow against light, but I had heard
him sniff.</p>
<p>I returned the few steps.</p>
<p>"Here what is?"</p>
<p>"Your rose."</p>
<p>He produced a plastic container, divided internally.  The lower
half was filled with liquid.  The stem ran down into it.  The other
half, a glass of claret in this horrible night, was a large, newly
opened rose.</p>
<p>"Thank you," I said, tucking it in my jacket.</p>
<p>"Going back to Tirellian, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I saw you come aboard, so I got it ready.  Just missed you at the
Captain's cabin.  He was busy.  Hollered out that I could catch you at
the barns."</p>
<p>"Thanks again."</p>
<p>"It's chemically treated.  It will stay in bloom for weeks."</p>
<p>I nodded.  I was gone.</p>
<p>Up into the mountains now.  Far.  Far.  The sky was a bucket of ice in
which no moons floated.  The going became steeper, and the little
donkey protested.  I whipped him with the throttle and went on.  Up.
Up.  I spotted a green, unwinking star, and felt a lump in my throat.
The encased rose beat against my chest like an extra heart.  The donkey
brayed, long and loudly, then began to cough.  I lashed him some more
and he died.</p>
<p>I threw the emergency brake on and got out.  I began to walk.</p>
<p>So cold, so cold it grows.  Up here.  At night?  Why?  Why did she
do it?  Why flee the campfire when night comes on?</p>
<p>And I was up, down, around, and through every chasm, gorge, and
pass, with my long-legged strides and an ease of movement never known
on Earth.</p>
<p>Barely two days remain, my love, and thou hast forsaken me.  Why?</p>
<p>I crawled under overhangs.  I leaped over ridges.  I scraped my
knees, an elbow.  I heard my jacket tear.</p>
<p>No answer, Malann?  Do you really hate your people this much?
Then I'll try someone else.  Vishnu, you're the Preserver.  Preserve
her, please!  Let me find her.</p>
<p>Jehovah?</p>
<p>Adonis?  Osiris?  Thammuz?  Manitou?  Legba?  Where is she?</p>
<p>I ranged far and high, and I slipped.</p>
<p>Stones ground underfoot and I dangled over an edge.  My fingers so
cold.  It was hard to grip the rock.</p>
<p>I looked down.</p>
<p>Twelve feet or so.  I let go and dropped, landed rolling.</p>
<p>Then I heard her scream.</p>
<p>I lay there, not moving, looking up.  Against the night, above, she
called.</p>
<p>"Gallinger!"</p>
<p>I lay still.</p>
<p>"Gallinger!"</p>
<p>And she was gone.</p>
<p>I heard stones rattle and knew she was coming down some path to
the right of me.</p>
<p>I jumped up and ducked into the shadow of a boulder.</p>
<p>She rounded a cut-off, and picked her way, uncertainly, through
the stones.</p>
<p>"Gallinger?"</p>
<p>I stepped out and seized her by the shoulders.</p>
<p>"Braxa."</p>
<p>She screamed again, then began to cry, crowding against me.  It
was the first time I had ever heard her cry.</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked.  "Why?"</p>
<p>But she only clung to me and sobbed.</p>
<p>Finally, "I thought you had killed yourself."</p>
<p>"Maybe I would have," I said.  "Why did you leave Tirellian?  And
me?"</p>
<p>"Didn't M'Cwyie tell you?  Didn't you guess?"</p>
<p>"I didn't guess, and M'Cwyie said she didn't know."</p>
<p>"Then she lied.  She knows."</p>
<p>"What?  What is it she knows?"</p>
<p>She shook all over, then was silent for a long time.  I realized
suddenly that she was wearing only her flimsy dancer's costume.  I
pushed her from me, took off my jacket, and put it about her
shoulders.</p>
<p>"Great Malann!" I cried.  "You'll freeze to death!"</p>
<p>"No," she said, "I won't."</p>
<p>I was transferring the rose-case to my pocket.</p>
<p>"What is that?" she asked.</p>
<p>"A rose," I answered.  "You can't make it out in the dark.  I once
compared you to one.  Remember?"</p>
<p>"Yes--Yes.  May I carry it?"</p>
<p>"Sure."  I stuck it in the jacket pocket.</p>
<p>"Well?  I'm still waiting for an explanation."</p>
<p>"You really do not know?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"When the Rains came," she said, "apparently only our men were
affected, which was enough....Because I--wasn't--affected--apparently--"</p>
<p>"Oh," I said.  "Oh."</p>
<p>We stood there, and I thought.</p>
<p>"Well, why did you run?  What's wrong with being pregnant on Mars?
Tamur was mistaken.  Your people can live again."</p>
<p>She laughed, again that wild violin played by a Paginini gone mad.
I stopped her before it went too far.</p>
<p>"How?" she finally asked, rubbing her cheek.</p>
<p>"Your people can live longer than ours.  If our child is normal it
will mean our races can intermarry.  There must still be other fertile
women of your race.  Why not?"</p>
<p>"You have read the Book of Locar," she said, "and yet you ask me
that?  Death was decided, voted upon, and passed, shortly after it
appeared in this form.  But long before, before the followers of Locar
knew.  They decided it long ago.  `We have done all things,' they
said, 'we have seen all things, we have heard and felt all things.
The dance was good.  Now let it end.'"</p>
<p>"You can't believe that."</p>
<p>"What I believe does not matter," she replied.  "M'Cwyie and the
Mothers have decided we must die.  Their very title is now a mockery,
but their decisions will be upheld.  There is only one prophecy left,
and it is mistaken.  We will die."</p>
<p>"No," I said.</p>
<p>"What, then?"</p>
<p>"Come back with me, to Earth."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"All right, then.  Come with me now."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Back to Tirellian.  I'm going to talk to the Mothers."</p>
<p>"You can't!  There is a Ceremony tonight!"</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>"A Ceremony for a god who knocks you down, and then kicks you in
the teeth?"</p>
<p>"He is still Malann," she answered.  "We are still his people."</p>
<p>"You and my father would have gotten along fine," I snarled.  "But
I am going, and you are coming with me, even if I have to carry
you--and I'm bigger than you are."</p>
<p>"But you are not bigger than Ontro."</p>
<p>"Who the hell is Ontro?"</p>
<p>"He will stop you, Gallinger.  He is the Fist of Malann."</p>

<title><p>IV</p></title>


<p>I scudded the jeepster to a halt in front of the only entrance I knew,
M'Cwyie's.  Braxa, who had seen the rose in a headlamp, now cradled it
in her lap, like our child, and said nothing.  There was a passive,
lovely look on her face.</p>
<p>"Are they in the Temple now?" I wanted to know.</p>
<p>The Madonna-expression did not change.  I repeated the question.
She stirred.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, from a distance, "but you cannot go in."</p>
<p>"We'll see."</p>
<p>I circled and helped her down.</p>
<p>I led her by the hand, and she moved as if in a trance.  In the
light of the new-risen moon, her eyes looked as they had the day I had
met her, when she had danced.  I snapped my fingers.  Nothing
happened.</p>
<p>So I pushed the door open and led her in.  The room was
half-lighted.</p>
<p>And she screamed for the third time that evening:</p>
<p>"Do not harm him, Ontro!  It is Gallinger!"</p>
<p>I had never seen a Martian man before, only women.  So I had no
way of knowing whether he was a freak, though I suspected it strongly.</p>
<p>I looked up at him.</p>
<p>His half-naked body was covered with moles and swellings.  Gland
trouble, I guessed.</p>
<p>I had thought I was the tallest man on the planet, but he was
seven feet tall and overweight.  Now I knew where my giant bed had
come from!</p>
<p>"Go back," he said.  "She may enter.  You may not."</p>
<p>"I must get my books and things."</p>
<p>He raised a huge left arm.  I followed it.  All my belonging lay
neatly stacked in the corner.</p>
<p>"I must go in.  I must talk with M'Cwyie and the Mothers."</p>
<p>"You may not."</p>
<p>"The lives of your people depend on it."</p>
<p>"Go back," he boomed.  "Go home to <emphasis>your</emphasis> people, Gallinger.
Leave <emphasis>us</emphasis>!"</p>
<p>My name sounded so different on his lips, like someone else's.
How old was he? I wondered.  Three hundred?  Four?  Had he been a
Temple guardian all his life?  Why?  Who was there to guard against?
I didn't like the way he moved.  I had seen men who moved like that
before.</p>
<p>"Go back," he repeated.</p>
<p>If they had refined their martial arts as far as they had their
dances, or worse yet, if their fighting arts were a part of the dance,
I was in for trouble.</p>
<p>"Go on in," I said to Braxa.  "Give the rose to M'Cwyie.  Tell her
that I sent it.  Tell her I'll be there shortly."</p>
<p>"I will do as you ask.  Remember me on Earth, Gallinger.
Good-bye."</p>
<p>I did not answer her, and she walked past Ontro and into the next
room, bearing her rose.</p>
<p>"Now will you leave?" he asked.  "If you like, I will tell her
that we fought and you almost beat me, but I knocked you unconscious
and carried you back to your ship."</p>
<p>"No," I said, "either I go around you or go over you, but I am
going through."</p>
<p>He dropped into a crouch, arms extended.</p>
<p>"It is a sin to lay hands on a holy man," he rumbled, "but I will
stop you, Gallinger."</p>
<p>My memory was a fogged window, suddenly exposed to fresh air.
Things cleared.  I looked back six years.</p>
<p>I was a student of the Oriental Languages at the University of
Tokyo.  It was my twice-weekly night of recreation.  I stood in a
thirty-foot circle in the Kodokan, the <emphasis>judogi</emphasis> lashed about my high
hips by a brown belt.  I was <emphasis>Ik-kyu</emphasis>, one notch below the lowest
degree of expert.  A brown diamond above my right breast said
"Jiu-Jitsu" in Japanese, and it meant <emphasis>atemiwaza</emphasis>, really, because of
the one striking-technique I had worked out, found unbelievably
suitable to my size, and won matches with.</p>
<p>But I had never used it on a man, and it was five years since I
had practiced.  I was out of shape, I knew, but I tried hard to force
my mind <emphasis>tsuki no kokoro</emphasis>, like the moon, reflecting the all of Ontro.</p>
<p>Somewhere, out of the past, a voice said "<emphasis>Hajime</emphasis>, let it begin."</p>
<p>I snapped into my <emphasis>neko-ashi-dachi</emphasis> cat-stance, and his eyes
burned strangely.  He hurried to correct his own position--and I threw
it at him!</p>
<p>My one trick!</p>
<p>My long left leg lashed up like a broken spring.  Seven feet off
the ground my foot connected with his jaw as he tried to leap
backward.</p>
<p>His head snapped back and he fell.  A soft moan escaped his lips.
<emphasis>That's all there is to it,</emphasis> I thought.  <emphasis>Sorry, old fellow.</emphasis></p>
<p>And as I stepped over him, somehow, groggily, he tripped me, and I
fell across his body.  I couldn't believe he had strength enough to
remain conscious after that blow, let alone move.  I hated to punish
him any more.</p>
<p>But he found my throat and slipped a forearm across it before I
realized there was a purpose to his action.</p>
<p><emphasis>No!  Don't let it end like this!</emphasis></p>
<p>It was a bar of steel across my windpipe, my carotids.  Then I
realized that he was still unconscious, and that this was a reflex
instilled by countless years of training.  I had seen it happen once,
in <emphasis>shiai</emphasis>.  The man had died because he had been choked unconscious
and still fought on, and his opponent thought he had not been applying
the choke properly.  He tried harder.</p>
<p>But it was rare, so very rare!</p>
<p>I jammed my elbow into his ribs and threw my head back in his
face.  The grip eased, but not enough.  I hated to do it, but I
reached up and broke his little finger.</p>
<p>The arm went loose and I twisted free.</p>
<p>He lay there panting, face contorted.  My heart went out to the
fallen giant, defending his people, his religion, following his
orders.  I cursed myself as I had never cursed before, for walking
over him, instead of around.</p>
<p>I staggered across the room to my little heap of possessions.  I
sat on the projector case and lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>I couldn't go into the Temple until I got my breath back, until I
thought of something to say.</p>
<p>How do you talk a race out of killing itself?</p>
<p>Suddenly--</p>
<p>--Could it happen!  Would it work that way?  If I read them the
Book of Ecclesiastes--if I read them a greater piece of literature than
any Locar ever wrote--and as somber--and as pessimistic--and showed them
that our race had gone on despite one man's condemning all of life in
the highest poetry--showed them that the vanity he had mocked had borne
us to the Heavens--would they believe it--would they change their minds?</p>
<p>I ground out my cigarette on the beautiful floor, and found my
notebook.  A strange fury rose within me as I stood.</p>
<p>And I walked into the Temple to preach the Black Gospel according
to Gallinger, from the Book of Life.</p>
<p>There was silence all about me.</p>
<p>M'Cwyie had been reading Locar, the rose set at her right hand,
target of all eyes.</p>
<p>Until I entered.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people were seated on the floor, barefoot.  The few
men were as small as the women, I noted.</p>
<p>I had my boots on.</p>
<p><emphasis>Go all the way,</emphasis> I figured.  <emphasis>You either lose or you
win--everything!</emphasis></p>
<p>A dozen crones sat in a semicircle behind M'Cwyie.  The Mothers.</p>
<p><emphasis>The barren earth, the dry wombs, the fire-touched.</emphasis></p>
<p>I moved to the table.</p>
<p>"Dying yourselves, you would condemn your people," I addressed
them, "that they may not know the life you have known--the joys, the
sorrows, the fullness.  --But it is not true that you all must die."  I
addressed the multitude now.  "Those who say this lie.  Braxa knows,
for she will bear a child--"</p>
<p>They sat there, like rows of Buddhas.  M'Cwyie drew back into the
semicircle.</p>
<p>"--my child!" I continued, wondering what my father would have
thought of this sermon.</p>
<p>"...And all the women young enough may bear children.  It is only
your men who are sterile.  --And if you permit the doctors of the next
expedition to examine you, perhaps even the men may be helped.  But if
they cannot, you can mate with the men of Earth.</p>
<p>"And ours is not an insignificant people, an insignificant place,"
I went on.  "Thousands of years ago, the Locar of our world wrote a
book saying that it was.  He spoke as Locar did, but we did not lie
down, despite plagues, wars, and famines.  We did not die.  One by one
we beat down the diseases, we fed the hungry, we fought the wars, and,
recently, have gone a long time without them.  We may finally have
conquered them.  I do not know.</p>
<p>"But we have crossed millions of miles of nothingness.  We have
visited another world.  And our Locar had said `Why bother?  What is
the worth of it?  It is all vanity, anyhow.'</p>
<p>"And the secret is," I lowered my voice, as at a poetry reading,
"he was right!  It <emphasis>is</emphasis> vanity, it <emphasis>is</emphasis> pride!  It is the hubris of
rationalism to always attack the prophet, the mystic, the god.  It is
our blasphemy which has made us great, and will sustain us, and which
the gods secretly admire in us.  --All the truly sacred names of God
are blasphemous things to speak!"</p>
<p>I was working up a sweat.  I paused dizzily.</p>
<p>"Here is the Book of Ecclesiastes," I announced, and began:</p>
<p>"`Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all
if vanity.  What profit hath a man...'"</p>
<p>I spotted Braxa in the back, mute, rapt.</p>
<p>I wondered what she was thinking.</p>
<p>And I wound the hours of the night about me, like black thread on
a spool.</p>
<p>Oh, it was late!  I had spoken till day came, and still I spoke.  I
finished Ecclesiastes and continued Gallinger.</p>
<p>And when I finished there was still only a silence.</p>
<p>The Buddhas, all in a row, had not stirred through the night.  And
after a long while M'Cwyie raised her right hand.  One by one the
Mothers did the same.</p>
<p>And I knew what that meant.</p>
<p>It meant, no, do not, cease, and stop.</p>
<p>It meant that I had failed.</p>
<p>I walked slowly from the room and slumped beside my baggage.</p>
<p>Ontro was gone.  Good that I had not killed him....</p>
<p>After a thousand years M'Cwyie entered.</p>
<p>She said, "Your job is finished."</p>
<p>I did not move.</p>
<p>"The prophecy is fulfilled," she said.  "My people are rejoicing.
You have won, holy man.  Now leave us quickly."</p>
<p>My mind was a deflated balloon.  I pumped a little air back into
it.</p>
<p>"I'm not a holy man," I said, "just a second-rate poet with a bad
case of hubris."</p>
<p>I lit my last cigarette.</p>
<p>Finally, "All right, what prophecy?"</p>
<p>"The Promise of Locar," she replied, as though the explaining were
unnecessary, "that a holy man would come from the Heavens to save us
in our last hours, if all the dances of Locar were completed.  He
would defeat the Fist of Malann and bring us life."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"As with Braxa, and as the example in the Temple."</p>
<p>"Example?"</p>
<p>"You read us his words, as great as Locar's.  You read to us how
there is `nothing new under the sun.'  And you mocked his words as you
read them--showing us a new thing.</p>
<p>"There has never been a flower on Mars," she said, "but we will
learn to grow them.</p>
<p>"You are the Sacred Scoffer," she finished.
"He-Who-Must-Mock-in-the-Temple--you go shod on holy ground."</p>
<p>"But you voted `no,'" I said.</p>
<p>"I voted not to carry out our original plan, and to let Braxa's
child live instead."</p>
<p>"Oh."  The cigarette fell from my fingers.  How close it had been!
How little I had known!</p>
<p>"And Braxa?"</p>
<p>"She was chosen half a Process ago to do the dances--to wait for
you."</p>
<p>"But she said that Ontro would stop me."</p>
<p>M'Cwyie stood there for a long time.</p>
<p>"She had never believed the prophecy herself.  Things are not well
with her now.  She ran away, fearing it was true.  When you completed
it, and we voted, she knew."</p>
<p>"Then she does not love me?  Never did?"</p>
<p>"I am sorry, Gallinger.  It was the one part of her duty she never
managed."</p>
<p>"Duty," I said flatly....Dutydutyduty!  Tra-la!</p>
<p>"She has said good-bye, she does wish to see you again.</p>
<p>"...and we will never forget your teachings," she added.</p>
<p>"Don't," I said automatically, suddenly knowing the great paradox
which lies at the heart of all miracles.  I did not believe a word of
my own gospel, never had.</p>
<p>I stood, like a drunken man, and muttered "M'narra."</p>
<p>I went outside, into my last day on Mars.</p>
<p><emphasis>I have conquered thee, Malann--and the victory is thine!  Rest
easy on thy starry bed.  God damned!</emphasis></p>
<p>I left the jeepster there and walked back to the <emphasis>Aspic</emphasis>, leaving
the burden of life so many footsteps behind me.  I went to my cabin,
locked the door, and took forty-four sleeping pills.</p>
<p>But when I awakened I was in the dispensary, and alive.</p>
<p>I felt the throb of engines as I slowly stood up and somehow made
it to the port.</p>
<p>Blurred Mars hung like a swollen belly above me, until it
dissolved, brimmed over, and streamed down my face.</p>

<section>

<p>A great unrest was among the people, for the time of decision was again
at hand. The Elders voted upon the candidates and the sacrifice was affirmed
over the objections of Ryllik, the oldest.</p>
<p>"It is wrong to capitulate thus," he argued.</p>
<p>But  they  did  not  answer  him, and the young virgin was taken to the
grotto of smokes and fed the leaves of drowsiness.</p>
<p>Ryllik watched with disapproval.</p>
<p>"It should not be so," he stated. "It is wrong."</p>
<p>"It has always been so," said the others, "in the spring of  the  year,
and  in the fall. It has always been so." And they cast worried glances down
the trail to where the sun was pouring morning upon the world.</p>
<p>The god was already traveling through the great-leafed forest.</p>
<p>"Let us go now," they said.</p>
<p>"Did you ever think of staying? Of watching to see what the monster god
does?" asked Ryllik bitterly.</p>
<p>"Enough of your blasphemies! Come along!"</p>
<p>Ryllik followed them.</p>
<p>"We grow fewer every year," he said. "One day we shall no  longer  have
any sacrifices left to offer."</p>
<p>"Then that day we die," said the others.</p>
<p>"So  why  prolong it?" he asked. "Let us fight them--now, before we are
no more!"</p>
<p>But the others shook their heads, a summary of that resignation  Ryllik
had  watched  grow as the centuries passed. They all respected Ryllik's age,
but they did not approve of his thoughts. They cast one last look back, just
as the sun caught the clanking god  upon  his  gilt-caparisoned  mount,  his
death-lance  slung  at his side. Within the place where the smokes were born
the maiden thrashed her tail from side to side, rolling  wild  eyes  beneath
her youthful browplates. She sensed the divine presence and began to bellow.</p>
<p>They turned away and lumbered across the plains.</p>
<p>As  they  neared  the forest Ryllik paused and raised a scaly forelimb,
groping after a thought. Finally, he spoke.</p>
<p>"I seem to  have  memory,"  said  he,  "of  a  time  when  things  were
different."</p>

<p>"What are you doing there, human?"</p>
<p>"It's a long story."</p>
<p>"Good, I like long stories.  Sit down and talk.  No--not on me!"</p>
<p>"Sorry.  Well, it's all because of my uncle, the fabulously
wealthy--"</p>
<p>"Stop.  What does 'wealthy' mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, like rich."</p>
<p>"And 'rich'?"</p>
<p>"Hm.  Lots of money."</p>
<p>"What's money?"</p>
<p>"You want to hear this story or don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I'd like to understand it too."</p>
<p>"Sorry, Rock, I'm afraid I don't understand it all myself."</p>
<p>"The name is Stone."</p>
<p>"Okay, Stone.  My uncle, who is a very important man, was supposed
to send me to the Space Academy, but he didn't.  He decided a liberal
education was a better thing.  So he sent me to his old spinster alma
mater to major in nonhuman humanities.  You with me, so far?"</p>
<p>"No, but understanding is not necessarily an adjunct to
appreciation."</p>
<p>"That's what I say.  I'll never understand Uncle Sidney, but I
appreciate his outrageous tastes, his magpie instinct and his gross
meddling in other people's affairs.  I appreciate them till I'm sick
to the stomach.  There's nothing else I can do.  He's a carnivorous
old family monument, and fond of having his own way.  Unfortunately,
he also has all the money in the family--so it follows, like a _xxt_
after a _zzn_, that he always _does_ have his own way."</p>
<p>"This money must be pretty important stuff."</p>
<p>"Important enough to send me across ten thousand light-years to an
unnamed world, which, incidentally, I've just named Dunghill."</p>
<p>"The low-flying _zatt_ is a heavy eater, which accounts for its
low flying..."</p>
<p>"So I've noted.  That _is_ moss though, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Good, then crating will be less of a problem."</p>
<p>"What's 'crating'?"</p>
<p>"It means to put something in a box to take it somewhere else."</p>
<p>"Like moving around?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What are you planning on crating?"</p>
<p>"Yourself, Stone."</p>
<p>"I've never been the rolling sort..."</p>
<p>"Listen, Stone, my uncle is a rock collector, see?  You are the
only species of intelligent mineral in the galaxy.  You are also the
largest specimen I've spotted so far.  Do you follow me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I don't want to."</p>
<p>"Why not?  You'd be lord of his rock collection.  Sort of a
one-eyed man in a kingdom of the blind, if I may venture an
inappropriate metaphor."</p>
<p>"Please don't do that, whatever it is.  It sounds awful.  Tell me,
how did your uncle learn of our world?"</p>
<p>"One of my instructors read about this place in an old space log.
_He_ was an old space log collector.  The log had belonged to a
Captain Fairhill, who landed here several centuries ago and held
lengthy discourses with your people."</p>
<p>"Good old Foul Weather Fairhill!  How is he these days?  Give him
my regards--"</p>
<p>"He's dead."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Dead.  Kaput.  Blooey.  Gone.  Deeble."</p>
<p>"Oh my!  When did it happen?  I trust it was an esthetic
occurrence of major import--"</p>
<p>"I couldn't really say.  But I passed the information on to my
uncle, who decided to collect you.  That's why I'm here--he sent me."</p>
<p>"Really, as much as I appreciate the compliment, I can't accompany
you.  It's almost deeble time--"</p>
<p>"I know, I read all about deebling in the Fairhill log before I
showed it to Uncle Sidney.  I tore those pages out.  I want him to be
around when you do it.  Then I can inherit his money and console
myself in all manner of expensive ways for never having gone to the
Space Academy.  First I'll become an alcoholic, then I'll take up
wenching--or maybe I'd better do it the other way around..."</p>
<p>"But I want to deeble here, among the things I've become attached
to!"</p>
<p>"This is a crowbar.  I'm going to unattach you."</p>
<p>"If you try it, I'll deeble right now."</p>
<p>"You can't.  I measured your mass before we struck up this
conversation.  It will take at least eight months, under Earth
conditions, for you to reach deebling proportions."</p>
<p>"Okay, I was bluffing.  But have you no compassion?  I've rested
here for centuries, ever since I was a small pebble, as did my fathers
before me.  I've added so carefully to my atom collection, building up
the finest molecular structure in the neighborhood.  And now, to be
snatched away right before deebling time, it's--it's quite unrock of
you."</p>
<p>"It's not that bad.  I promise you'll collect the finest Earth
atoms available.  You'll go places no other Stone has ever been
before."</p>
<p>"Small consolation.  I want my friends to see."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that's out of the question."</p>
<p>"You are a very cruel human.  I hope you're around when I deeble."</p>
<p>"I intend to be far away and on the eve of prodigious debaucheries
when that occurs."</p>
<p>Under Dunghill's sub-E gravitation Stone was easily rolled to the side
of the space sedan, crated, and, with the help of a winch, installed
in the compartment beside the atomic pile.  The fact that it was a
short-jaunt sport model sedan, customized by its owner, who had
removed much of the shielding, was the reason Stone felt a sudden
flush of volcanic drunkenness, rapidly added select items to his
collection and deebled on the spot.</p>
<p>He mushroomed upwards, then swept in great waves across the plains
of Dunghill.  Several young Stones fell from the dusty heavens wailing
their birth pains across the community band.</p>
<p>"Gone fission," commented a distant neighbor, above the static,
"and sooner than I expected.  Feel that warm afterglow!"</p>
<p>"An excellent deeble," agreed another.  "It always pays to be a
cautious collector."

<p>I looked down at it and I was sick!  I wondered, where did it lead?
Stars?</p>
<p>There were no words.  I stared and I stared, and I cursed the fact
that the thing existed and that someone had found it while I was still
around.</p>
<p>"Well?" said Lanning, and he banked the flier so that I could look
upward.</p>
<p>I shook my head and shaded my already shielded eyes.</p>
<p>"Make it go away," I finally told him.</p>
<p>"Can't.  It's bigger than I am."</p>
<p>"It's bigger than anybody," I said.</p>
<p>"I can make _us_ go away..."</p>
<p>"Never mind.  I want to take some pictures."</p>
<p>He brought it around, and I started to shoot.</p>
<p>"Can you hover--or get any closer?"</p>
<p>"No, the winds are too strong."</p>
<p>"That figures."</p>
<p>So I shot--through telescopic lenses and scan attachment and all--as
we circled it.</p>
<p>"I'd give a lot to see the top."</p>
<p>"We're at thirty thousand feet, and fifty's the ceiling on this
baby.  The Lady, unfortunately, stands taller than the atmosphere."</p>
<p>"Funny," I said, "from here she doesn't strike me as the sort to
breath ether and spend all her time looking at stars."</p>
<p>He chuckled and lit a cigarette, and I reached us another bulb of
coffee.</p>
<p>"How _does_ the Gray Sister strike you?"</p>
<p>And I lit one of my own and inhaled, as the flier was buffeted by
sudden gusts of something from somewhere and then ignored, and I said,
"Like Our Lady of the Abattoir--right between the eyes."</p>
<p>We drank some coffee, and then he asked, "She too big, Whitey?"
and I gnashed my teeth through caffeine, for only my friends call me
Whitey, my name being Jack Summers and my hair having always been this
way, and at the moment I wasn't too certain of whether Henry Lanning
qualified for that status--just because he'd known me for twenty
years--after going out of his way to find this thing on a world with a
thin atmosphere, a lot of rocks, a too-bright sky and a name like LSD
pronounced backwards, after George Diesel, who had set foot in the
dust and then gone away--smart fellow!</p>
<p>"A forty-mile-high mountain," I finally said, "is not a mountain.
It is a world all by itself, which some dumb deity forgot to throw
into orbit."</p>
<p>"I take it you're not interested?"</p>
<p>I looked back at the gray and lavender slopes and followed them
upward once more again, until all color drained away, until the
silhouette was black and jagged and the top still nowhere in sight,
until my eyes stung and burned behind their protective glasses; and I
saw clouds bumping up against that invincible outline, like icebergs
in the sky, and I heard the howling of the retreating winds which had
essayed to measure its grandeur with swiftness and, of course, had
failed.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm interested," I said, "in an academic sort of way.  Let's
go back to town, where I can eat and drink and maybe break a leg if
I'm lucky."</p>
<p>He headed the flier south, and I didn't look around as we went.  I
could sense her presence at my back, though, all the way: The Gray
Sister, the highest mountain in the known universe.  Unclimbed, of
course.</p>
<p>She remained at my back during the days that followed, casting her
shadow over everything I looked upon.  For the next two days I studied
the pictures I had taken and I dug up some maps and I studied them,
too; and I spoke with people who told me stories of the Gray Sister,
strange stories....</p>
<p>During this time, I came across nothing really encouraging.  I
learned that there had been an attempt to colonize Diesel a couple
centuries previously, back before faster-than-light ships were
developed.  A brand-new disease had colonized the first colonists,
however, wiping them out to a man.  The new colony was four years old,
had better doctors, had beaten the plague, was on Diesel to stay and
seemed proud of its poor taste when it came to worlds.  Nobody, I
learned, fooled around much with the Gray Sister.  There had been a
few abortive attempts to climb her, and some young legends that
followed after.</p>
<p>During the day, the sky never shut up.  It kept screaming into my
eyes, until I took to wearing my climbing goggles whenever I went out.
Mainly, though, I sat in the hotel lounge and ate and drank and
studied the pictures and cross-examined anyone who happened to pass by
and glance at them, spread out there on the table.</p>
<p>I continued to ignore all Henry's questions.  I knew what he
wanted, and he could damn well wait.  Unfortunately, he did, and
rather well, too, which irritated me.  He felt I was almost hooked by
the Sister, and he wanted to Be There When It Happened.  He'd made a
fortune on the Kasla story, and I could already see the opening
sentences of this one in the smug lines around his eyes.  Whenever he
tried to make like a poker player, leaning on his fist and slowly
turning a photo, I could see whole paragraphs.  If I followed the
direction of his gaze, I could probably even have seen the dust
jacket.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, a ship came down out of the sky, and some
nasty people got off and interrupted my train of thought.  When they
came into the lounge, I recognized them for what they were and removed
my black lenses so that I could nail Henry with my basilisk gaze and
turn him into stone.  As it would happen, he had too much alcohol in
him, and it didn't work.</p>
<p>"You tipped off the press," I said.</p>
<p>"Now, now," he said, growing smaller and stiffening as my gaze
groped its way through the murk of his central nervous system and
finally touched upon the edges of that tiny tumor, his forebrain.
"You're well known, and...."</p>
<p>I replaced my glasses and hunched over my drink, looking far gone,
as one of the three approached and said, "Pardon me, but are you Jack
Summers?"</p>
<p>To explain the silence which followed, Henry said, "Yes, this is
Mad Jack, the man who climbed Everest at twenty-three and every other
pile of rocks worth mentioning since that time.  At thirty-one, he
became the only man to conquer the highest mountain in the known
universe--Mount Kasla on Litan--elevation, 89,941 feet.  My book--"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the reporter.  "My name is Cary, and I'm with GP.  My
friends represent two of the other syndicates.  We've heard that you
are going to climb the Gray Sister."</p>
<p>"You've heard incorrectly," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>The other two came up and stood beside them.</p>
<p>"We thought that--" one of them began.</p>
<p>"--you were already organizing a climbing party," said the other.</p>
<p>"Then you're not going to climb the Sister?" asked Cary, while one
of the two looked over my pictures and the other got ready to take
some of his own.</p>
<p>"Stop that!" I said, raising a hand at the photographer.  "Bright
lights hurt my eyes!"</p>
<p>"Sorry.  I'll use the infra," he said, and he started fooling with
his camera.</p>
<p>Cary repeated the question.</p>
<p>"All I said was that you've heard incorrectly," I told him.  "I
didn't say I was and I didn't say I wasn't.  I haven't made up my
mind."</p>
<p>"If you decide to try it, have you any idea when it will be?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, I can't answer that."</p>
<p>Henry took the three of them over to the bar and started
explaining something, with gestures.  I heard the words "...out of
retirement after four years," and when/if they looked to the booth
again, I was gone.</p>
<p>I had retired, to the street which was full of dusk, and I walked
along it thinking.  I trod her shadow even then, Linda.  And the Gray
Sister beckoned and forbade with her single unmoving gesture.  I
watched her, so far away, yet still so large, a piece of midnight at
eight o'clock.  The hours that lay between died like the distance at
her feet, and I knew that she would follow me wherever I went, even
into sleep.  Especially into sleep.</p>
<p>So I know, at that moment.  The days that followed were a game I
enjoyed playing.  Fake indecision is delicious when people want you to
do something.  I looked at her then, my last and my largest, my very
own Koshtra Pivrarcha, and I felt that I was born to stand upon her
summit.  Then I could retire, probably remarry, cultivate my mind, not
worry about getting out of shape, and do all the square things I
didn't do before, the lack of which had cost me a wife and a home,
back when I had gone to Kasla, elevation 89,941 feet, four and a half
years ago, in the days of my glory.  I regarded my Gray Sister across
the eight o'clock world, and she was dark and noble and still and
waiting, as she had always been.</p>

<title><p>II</p></title>


<p>The following morning I sent the messages.  Out across the light-years
like cosmic carrier pigeons they went.  They winged their ways to some
persons I hadn't seen in years and to others who had seen me off at
Luna Station.  Each said, in its own way, "If you want in on the
biggest climb of them all, come to Diesel.  The Gray Sister eats Kasla
for breakfast.  R.S.V.P. c/o. The Lodge, Georgetown.  Whitey."</p>
<p>Backward, turn backward....</p>
<p>I didn't tell Henry.  Nothing at all.  What I had done and where I
was going, for a time, were my business only, for that same time.  I
checked out well before sunrise and left him a message on the desk:</p>
<p>"Out of town on business.  Back in a week.  Hold the fort.  Mad
Jack."</p>
<p>I had to gauge the lower slopes, tug the hem of the lady's skirt,
so to speak, before I introduced her to my friends.  They say only a
madman climbs alone, but they call me what they call me for a reason.</p>
<p>From my pix, the northern face had looked promising.</p>
<p>I set the rented flier down as near as I could, locked it up,
shouldered my pack and started walking.</p>
<p>Mountains rising to my right and to my left, mountains at my back,
all dark as sin now in the predawn light of a white, white day.  Ahead
of me, not a mountain, but an almost gentle slope which kept rising
and rising and rising.  Bright stars above me and cold wind past me as
I walked.  Straight up, though, no stars, just black.  I wondered for
the thousandth time what a mountain weighed.  I always wonder that as
I approach one.  No clouds in sight.  No noises but my boot sounds on
the turf and the small gravel.  My small goggles flopped around my
neck.  My hands were moist within my gloves.  On Diesel, the pack and
I together probably weighed about the same as me alone on Earth--for
which I was duly grateful.  My breath burned as it came and steamed as
it went.  I counted a thousand steps and looked back, and I couldn't
see the flier.  I counted a thousand more and then looked up to watch
some stars go out.  About an hour after that, I had to put on my
goggles.  By then I could see where I was headed.  And by then the
wind seemed stronger.</p>
<p>She was so big that the eye couldn't take all of her in at once.
I moved my head from side to side, leaning further and further
backward.  Wherever the top, it was too high.  For an instant, I was
seized by a crazy acrophobic notion that I was looking down rather
than up, and the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands tingled,
like an ape's must when, releasing one high branch to seize another,
he discovers that there isn't another.</p>
<p>I went on for two more hours and stopped for a light meal.  This
was hiking, not climbing.  As I ate, I wondered what could have caused
a formation like the Gray Sister.  There were some ten and twelve-mile
peaks within sixty miles of the place and a fifteen-mile mountain
called Burke's Peak on the adjacent continent, but nothing else like
the Sister.  The lesser gravitation?  Her composition?  I couldn't
say.  I wondered what Doc and Kelly and Mallardi would say when they
saw her.</p>
<p>I don't define them, though.  I only climb them.</p>
<p>I looked up again, and a few clouds were brushing against her now.
>From the photos I had taken, she might be an easy ascent for a good
ten or twelve miles.  Like a big hill.  There were certainly enough
alternate routes.  In fact, I thought she just might be a pushover.
Feeling heartened, I repacked my utensils and proceeded.  It was going
to be a good day.  I could tell.</p>
<p>And it was.  I got off the slope and onto something like a trail
by late afternoon.  Daylight lasts about nine hours on Diesel, and I
spent most of it moving.  The trail was so good that I kept on for
several hours after sundown and made considerable height.  I was
beginning to use my respiration equipment by then, and the heating
unit in my suit was turned on.</p>
<p>The stars were big, brilliant flowers, the way was easy, the night
was my friend.  I came upon a broad, flat piece and made my camp under
an overhang.</p>
<p>There I slept, and I dreamt of snowy women with breasts like the
Alps, pinked by the morning sun; and they sang to me like the wind and
laughed, had eyes of ice prismatic.  They fled through a field of
clouds.</p>
<p>The following day I made a lot more height.  The "trail" began to
narrow, and it ran out in places, but it was easy to reach for the sky
until another one occurred.  So far, it had all been good rock.  It
was still tapering as it heightened, and balance was no problem.  I
did a lot of plain old walking.  I ran up one long zigzag and hit it
up a wide chimney almost as fast as Santa Claus comes down one.  The
winds were strong, could be a problem if the going got difficult.  I
was on the respirator full time and feeling great.</p>
<p>I could see for an enormous distance now.  There were mountains
and mountains, all below me like desert dunes.  The sun beat halos of
heat about their peaks.  In the east, I saw Lake Emerick, dark and
shiny as the toe of a boot.  I wound my way about a jutting crag and
came upon a giant's staircase, going up for at least a thousand feet.
I mounted it.  At its top I hit my first real barrier: a fairly
smooth, almost perpendicular face rising for about eight-five feet.</p>
<p>No way around it, so I went up.  It took me a good hour, and there
was a ridge at the top leading to more easy climbing.  By then,
though, the clouds attacked me.  Even though the going was easy, I was
slowed by the fog.  I wanted to outclimb it and still have some
daylight left, so I decided to postpone eating.</p>
<p>But the clouds kept coming.  I made another thousand feet, and
they were still about me.  Somewhere below me, I heard thunder.  The
fog was easy on my eyes, though, so I kept pushing.</p>
<p>Then I tried a chimney, the top of which I could barely discern,
because it looked a lot shorter than a jagged crescent to its left.
This was a mistake.</p>
<p>The rate of condensation was greater than I'd guessed.  The walls
were slippery.  I'm stubborn, though, and I fought with skidding boots
and moist back until I was about a third of the way up, I thought, and
winded.</p>
<p>I realized then what I had done.  What I had thought was the top
wasn't.  I went another fifteen feet and wished I hadn't.  The fog
began to boil about me, and I suddenly felt drenched.  I was afraid to
go down and I was afraid to go up, and I couldn't stay where I was
forever.</p>
<p>Whenever you hear a person say that he inched along, do not accuse
him of a fuzzy choice of verbs.  Give him the benefit of the doubt and
your sympathy.</p>
<p>I inched my way, blind, up an unknown length of slippery chimney.
If my hair hadn't already been white when I entered at the bottom....</p>
<p>Finally, I got above the fog.  Finally, I saw a piece of that
bright and nasty sky, which I decided to forgive for the moment.  I
aimed at it, arrived on target.</p>
<p>When I emerged, I saw a little ledge about ten feet above me.  I
climbed to it and stretched out.  My muscles were a bit shaky, and I
made them go liquid.  I took a drink of water, ate a couple of
chocolate bars, took another drink.</p>
<p>After perhaps ten minutes, I stood up.  I could no longer see the
ground.  Just the soft, white, cottony top of a kindly old storm.  I
looked up.</p>
<p>It was amazing.  She was still topless.  And save for a couple
spots, such as the last--which had been the fault of my own stupid
overconfidence--it had almost been as easy as climbing stairs.</p>
<p>Now the going appeared to be somewhat rougher, however.  This was
what I had really come to test.</p>
<p>I swung my pick and continued.</p>
<p>All the following day I climbed, steadily, taking no unnecessary
risks, resting periodically, drawing maps, taking wide-angle photos.
The ascent eased in two spots that afternoon, and I made a quick seven
thousand feet.  Higher now than Everest, and still going, I.  Now,
though, there were places where I crawled and places where I used my
ropes, and there were places where I braced myself and used my
pneumatic pistol to blast a toehold.  (No, in case you're wondering: I
could have broken my eardrums, some ribs, and arm and doubtless
ultimately, my neck, if I'd tried using the gun in the chimney.)</p>
<p>Just near sunset, I came upon a high, easy winding way up and up
and up.  I debated with my more discreet self.  I'd left the message
that I'd be gone a week.  This was the end of the third day.  I wanted
to make as much height as possible and start back down on the fifth
day.  If I followed the rocky route above me as far as it would take
me I'd probably break forty thousand feet.  Then, depending, I might
have a halfway chance of hitting near the ten-mile mark before I had
to turn back.  Then I'd be able to get a much better picture of what
lay above.</p>
<p>My more discreet self lost, three to nothing, and Mad Jack went
on.</p>
<p>The stars were so big and blazing I was afraid they'd bite.  The
wind was no problem.  There wasn't any at that height.  I had to keep
stepping up the temperature controls on my suit, and I had the feeling
that if I could spit around my respirator, it would freeze before it
hit the trail.</p>
<p>I went on even further than I'd intended, and I broke forty-two
thousand that night.</p>
<p>I found a resting place, stretched out, killed my hand beacon.</p>
<p>It was an odd dream that came to me.</p>
<p>It was all cherry fires and stood like a man, only bigger, on the
slope above me.  It stood in an impossible position, so I knew I had
to be dreaming.  Something from the other end of my life stirred,
however, and I was convinced for a bitter moment that it was the Angel
of Judgment.  Only, in its right hand it seemed to hold a sword of
fires rather than a trumpet.  It had been standing there forever, the
tip of its blade pointed toward my breast.  I could see the stars
through it.  It seemed to speak.</p>
<p>It said: "_Go back_."</p>
<p>I couldn't answer it, though, for my tongue clove to the roof of
my mouth.  And it said it again, and yet a third time, "_Go back_."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow," I thought, in my dream, and this seemed to satisfy it.
for it died down and ceased, and the blackness rolled about me.</p>
<p>The following day, I climbed as I hadn't climbed in years.  By late
lunchtime I'd hit forty-eight thousand feet.  The cloud cover down
below had broken.  I could see what lay beneath me once more.  The
ground was a dark and light patchwork.  Above, the stars didn't go
away.</p>
<p>The going was rough, but I was feeling fine.  I knew I couldn't
make ten miles, because I could see that the way was pretty much the
same for quite a distance, before it got even worse.  My good spirits
stayed, and they continued to rise as I did.</p>
<p>When it attacked, it came on with a speed and a fury that I was
only barely able to match.</p>
<p>The voice from my dream rang in my head, "_Go back!  Go back!  Go
back!_"</p>
<p>Then it came toward me from out of the sky.  A bird the size of a
condor.  Only it wasn't really a bird.  It was a bird-shaped thing.</p>
<p>It was all fire and static, and as it flashed toward me I barely
had time to brace my back against stone and heft my climbing pick in
my right hand, ready.</p>

<title><p>III</p></title>


<p>I sat in the small, dark room and watched the spinning, colored
lights.  Ultrasonics were tickling my skull.  I tried to relax and
give the man some Alpha rhythms.  Somewhere a receiver was receiving,
a computer was computing and a recorder was recording.</p>
<p>It lasted perhaps twenty minutes.</p>
<p>When it was all over and they called me out, the doctor collared
me.  I beat him to the draw, though:</p>
<p>"Give me the tape and send the bill in care of Henry Lanning at
the Lodge."</p>
<p>"I want to discuss the reading," he said.</p>
<p>"I have my own brain-wave expert coming.  Just give me the tape."</p>
<p>"Have you undergone any sort of traumatic experience recently?"</p>
<p>"You tell me.  Is it indicated?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes and no," he said.</p>
<p>"That's what I like, a straight answer."</p>
<p>"I don't know what is normal for you, in the first place," he
replied.</p>
<p>"Is there any indication of brain damage?"</p>
<p>"I don't read it that way.  If you'd tell me what happened, and
why you're suddenly concerned about your brain-waves, perhaps I'd be
in a better position to...."</p>
<p>"Cut," I said.  "Just give me the tape and bill me."</p>
<p>"I'm concerned about you as a patient."</p>
<p>"But you don't think there were any pathological indications?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly.  But tell me this, if you will: Have you had an
epileptic seizure recently?"</p>
<p>"Not to my knowledge.  Why?"</p>
<p>"You displayed a pattern similar to a residual subrythm common in
some forms of epilepsy for several days subsequent to a seizure."</p>
<p>"Could a bump on the head cause that pattern?"</p>
<p>"It's highly unlikely."</p>
<p>"What else _could_ cause it?"</p>
<p>"Electrical shock, optical trauma--"</p>
<p>"Stop," I said, and I removed my glasses.  "About the optical
trauma.  Look at my eyes."</p>
<p>"I'm not an ophtha--" he began, but I interrupted:</p>
<p>"Most normal light hurts me eyes.  If I lost my glasses and was
exposed to very bright light for three, four days, could that cause the
pattern you spoke of?"</p>
<p>"Possible...." he said.  "Yes, I'd say so."</p>
<p>"But there's more?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure.  We have to take more readings, and if I know the
story behind this it will help a lot."</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said.  "I need the tape now."</p>
<p>He sighed and made a small gesture with his left hand as he turned
away.</p>
<p>"All right, Mister Smith."</p>
<p>Cursing the genius of the mountain, I left the General Hospital,
carrying my tape like a talisman.  In my mind I searched, through
forests of memory, for a ghost-sword in a stone of smoke, I think.</p>
<p>Back in the Lodge, they were waiting.  Lanning and the newsmen.</p>
<p>"What was it like?" asked one of the latter.</p>
<p>"What was what like?"</p>
<p>"The mountain.  You were up on it, weren't you?"</p>
<p>"No comment."</p>
<p>"How high did you go?"</p>
<p>"No comment."</p>
<p>"How would you say it compares with Kasla?"</p>
<p>"No comment."</p>
<p>"Did you run into any complications?"</p>
<p>"Ditto.  Excuse me, I want to take a shower."</p>
<p>Henry followed me into my room.  The reporters tried to.</p>
<p>After I had shaved and washed up, mixed a drink and lit a
cigarette, Lanning asked me his more general question:</p>
<p>"Well?" he said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Difficulties?"</p>
<p>I nodded again.</p>
<p>"Insurmountable?"</p>
<p>I hefted the tape and thought a moment.</p>
<p>"Maybe not."</p>
<p>He helped himself to the whiskey.  The second time around, he
asked:</p>
<p>"You going to try?"</p>
<p>I knew I was.  I knew I'd try it all by myself if I had to.</p>
<p>"I really don't know," I said.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because there's something up there," I said, "something that
doesn't want us to do it."</p>
<p>"Something _lives_ up there?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure whether that's the right word."</p>
<p>He lowered the drink.</p>
<p>"What the hell happened?"</p>
<p>"I was threatened.  I was attacked."</p>
<p>"Threatened?  Verbally?  In English?"  He set his drink aside,
which shows how serious his turn of mind had to be.  "Attacked?" he
added.  "By what?"</p>
<p>"I've sent for Doc and Kelly and Stan and Mallardi and Vincent.  I
checked a little earlier.  They've all replied.  They're coming.
Miguel and the Dutchman can't make it, and they send their regrets.
When we're all together, I'll tell the story.  But I want to talk to
Doc first.  So hold tight and worry and don't quote."</p>
<p>He finished his drink.</p>
<p>"When'll they be coming?"</p>
<p>"Four, five weeks," I said.</p>
<p>"That's a long wait."</p>
<p>"Under the circumstances," I said, "I can't think of any
alternatives."</p>
<p>"What'll we do in the meantime?"</p>
<p>"Eat, drink, and contemplate the mountain."</p>
<p>He lowered his eyelids a moment, then nodded, reached for his
glass.</p>
<p>"Shall we begin?"</p>
<p>It was late, and I stood alone in the field with a bottle in one hand.
Lanning had already turned in, and night's chimney was dark with cloud
soot.  Somewhere away from there, a storm was storming, and it was
full of instant outlines.  The wind came chill.</p>
<p>"Mountain," I said.  "Mountain, you have told me to go away."</p>
<p>There was a rumble.</p>
<p>"But I cannot," I said, and I took a drink.</p>
<p>"I'm bringing you the best in the business," I said, "to go up on
your slopes and to stand beneath the stars in your highest places.  I
must do this thing because you are there.  No other reason.  Nothing
personal...."</p>
<p>After a time, I said, "That's not true.</p>
<p>"I am a man," I said, "and I need to break mountains to prove that
I will not die even though I will die.  I am less than I want to be,
Sister, and you can make me more.  So I guess it _is_ personal.</p>
<p>"It's the only thing I know how to do, and you're the last one
left--the last challenge to the skill I spent my life learning.  Maybe
it is that mortality is the closest to immortality when it accepts a
challenge to itself, when it survives a threat.  The moment of triumph
is the moment of salvation.  I have needed many such moments, and the
final one must be the longest, for it must last me the rest of my
life.</p>
<p>"So you are there, Sister, and I am here and very mortal, and you
have told me to go away.  I cannot.  I'm coming up, and if you throw
death at me I will face it.  It must be so."</p>
<p>I finished what remained in the bottle.</p>
<p>There were more flashes, more rumbles behind the mountain, more
flashes.</p>
<p>"It is the closest thing to diving drunkenness," I said to the
thunder.</p>
<p>And then she winked at me.  It was a red star, so high upon her.
Angel's sword.  Phoenix' wing.  Soul on fire.  And it blazed at me,
across the miles.  Then the wind that blows between the worlds swept
down over me.  It was filled with tears and with crystals of ice.  I
stood there and felt it, then, "Don't go away," I said, and I watched
until all was darkness once more and I was wet as an embryo waiting to
cry out and breathe.</p>
<p>Most kids tell lies to their playmates--fictional autobiographies, if
you like--which are either received with appropriate awe or countered
with greater, more elaborate tellings.  But little Jimmy, I've heard,
always hearkened to his little buddies with wide, dark eyes, and near
the endings of their stories the corners of his mouth would begin to
twitch.  By the time they were finished talking, his freckles would be
mashed into a grin and his rusty head cocked to the side.  His
favorite expression, I understand, was "G'wan!" and his nose was
broken twice before he was twelve.  This was doubtless why he turned
it toward books.</p>
<p>Thirty years and four formal degrees later, he sat across from me
in my quarters in the lodge, and I called him Doc because everyone
did, because he had a license to cut people up and look inside them,
as well as doctoring to their philosophy, so to speak, and because he
looked as if he should be called Doc when he grinned and cocked his
head to the side and said, "G'wan!"</p>
<p>I wanted to punch him in the nose.</p>
<p>"Damn it!  It's true!" I told him.  "I fought with a bird of
fire!"</p>
<p>"We all hallucinated on Kasla," he said, raising one finger,
"because of fatigue," two fingers, "because the altitude affected our
circulatory systems and consequently our brains," three, "because of
the emotional stimulation," four, "and because we were pretty
oxygen-drunk."</p>
<p>"You just ran out of fingers, if you'll sit on your other hand for
a minute.  So listen," I said, "it flew at me, and I swung at it, and
it knocked me out and broke my goggles.  When I woke up, it was gone
and I was lying on the ledge.  I think it was some sort of energy
creature.  You saw my EEG, and it wasn't normal.  I think it shocked
my nervous system when it touched me."</p>
<p>"You were knocked out because you hit your head against a rock--"</p>
<p>"It _caused_ me to fall back against the rock!"</p>
<p>"I agree with that part.  The rock was real.  But nowhere in the
universe has anyone ever discovered an 'energy creature.'"</p>
<p>"So?  You probably would have said that about America a thousand
years ago."</p>
<p>"Maybe I would have.  But that neurologist explained your EEG to
my satisfaction.  Optical trauma.  Why go out of your way to dream up
an exotic explanation for events?  Easy ones generally turn out
better.  You hallucinated and you stumbled."</p>
<p>"Okay," I said, "whenever I argue with you I generally need
ammunition.  Hold on a minute."</p>
<p>I went to my closet and fetched it down from the top shelf.  I
placed it on my bed and began unwrapping the blanket I had around it.</p>
<p>"I told you I took a swing at it," I said.  "Well, I
connected--right before I went under.  Here!"</p>
<p>I held up my climbing pick--brown, yellow, black and pitted--looking
as though it had fallen from outer space.</p>
<p>He took it into his hands and stared at it for a long time, then
he started to say something about ball lightning, changed his mind,
shook his head and placed the thing back on the blanket.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he finally said, and this time his freckles
remained unmashed, except for those at the edges of his hands which
got caught as he clenched them, slowly.</p>

<title><p>IV</p></title>


<p>We planned.  We mapped and charted and studied the photos.  We plotted
our ascent and we started a training program.</p>
<p>While Doc and Stan had kept themselves in good shape, neither had
been climbing since Kasla.  Kelly was in top condition.  Henry was on
his way to fat.  Mallardi and Vince, as always, seemed capable of
fantastic feats of endurance and virtuosity, had even climbed a couple
times during the past year, but had recently been living pretty high
on the tall hog, so to speak, and they wanted to get some practice.
So we picked a comfortable, decent-sized mountain and gave it ten days
to beat everyone back into shape.  After that, we stuck to vitamins,
calisthenics and square diets while we completed our preparations.
During this time, Doc came up with seven shiny, alloy boxes, about six
by four inches and thin as a first book of poems, for us to carry on
our persons to broadcast a defense against the energy creatures which
he refused to admit existed.</p>
<p>One fine, bitter-brisk morning we were ready.  The newsmen liked
me again.  Much footage was taken of our gallant assemblage as we
packed ourselves into the fliers, to be delivered at the foot of the
lady mountain, there to contend for what was doubtless the final time
as the team we had been for so many years, against the waiting gray
and the lavender beneath the sunwhite flame.</p>
<p>We approached the mountain, and I wondered how much she weighed.</p>
<p>You know the way, for the first nine miles.  So I'll skip over that.
It took us six days and part of a seventh.  Nothing out of the
ordinary occurred.  Some fog there was, and nasty winds, but once
below, forgotten.</p>
<p>Stan and Mallardi and I stood where the bird had occurred, waiting
for Doc and the others.</p>
<p>"So far, it's been a picnic," said Mallardi.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Stan acknowledged.</p>
<p>"No birds either."</p>
<p>"No," I agreed.</p>
<p>"Do you think Doc was right--about it being an hallucination?"
Mallardi asked.  "I remember seeing things on Kasla...."</p>
<p>"As I recall," said Stan, "it was nymphs and an ocean of beer.
Why would anyone want to see hot birds?"</p>
<p>"Damfino."</p>
<p>"Laugh, you hyenas," I said.  "But just wait till a flock flies
over."</p>
<p>Doc came up and looked around.</p>
<p>"This is the place?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>He tested the background radiation and half a dozen other things,
found nothing untoward, grunted and looked upwards.</p>
<p>We all did.  Then we went there.</p>
<p>It was very rough for three days, and we only made another five
thousand feet during that time.</p>
<p>When we bedded down, we were bushed, and sleep came quickly.  So
did Nemesis.</p>
<p>He was there again, only not quite so near this time.  He burned
about twenty feet away, standing in the middle of the air, and the
point of his blade indicated me.</p>
<p>"_Go away_," he said, three times, without inflection.</p>
<p>"Go to hell," I tried to say.</p>
<p>He made as if he wished to draw nearer.  He failed.</p>
<p>"Go away yourself," I said.</p>
<p>"_Climb back down.  Depart.  You may go no further._"</p>
<p>"But I am going further.  All the way to the top."</p>
<p>"_No.  You may not._"</p>
<p>"Stick around and watch," I said.</p>
<p>"_Go back._"</p>
<p>"If you want to stand there and direct traffic, that's your
business," I told him.  "I'm going back to sleep."</p>
<p>I crawled over and shook Doc's shoulder, but when I looked back my
flaming visitor had departed.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Too late," I said.  "He's been here and gone."</p>
<p>Doc sat up.</p>
<p>"The bird?"</p>
<p>"No, the thing with the sword."</p>
<p>"Where was he?"</p>
<p>"Standing out there," I gestured.</p>
<p>Doc hauled out his instruments and did many things with them for
ten minutes or so.</p>
<p>"Nothing," he finally said.  "Maybe you were dreaming."</p>
<p>"Yeah, sure," I said.  "Sleep tight," and I hit the sack again,
and this time I made it through to daylight without further fire or
ado.</p>
<p>It took us four days to reach sixty thousand feet.  Rocks fell like
occasional cannonballs past us, and the sky was like a big pool, cool,
where pale flowers floated.  When we struck sixty-three thousand, the
going got much better, and we made it up to seventy-five thousand in
two and a half more days.  No fiery things stopped by to tell me to
turn back.  Then came the unforeseeable, however, and we had enough in
the way of natural troubles to keep us cursing.</p>
<p>We hit a big, level shelf.</p>
<p>It was perhaps four hundred feet wide.  As we advanced across it,
we realized that it did not strike the mountainside.  It dropped off
into an enormous gutter of a canyon.  We would have to go down again,
perhaps seven hundred feet, before we could proceed upward once more.
Worse yet, it led to a featureless face which strove for and achieved
perpendicularity for a deadly high distance: like miles.  The top was
still nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>"Where do we go now?" asked Kelly, moving to my side.</p>
<p>"Down," I decided, "and we split up.  We'll follow the big ditch
in both directions and see which way gives the better route up.  We'll
meet back at the midway point."</p>
<p>We descended.  Then Doc and Kelly and I went left, and the others
took the opposite way.</p>
<p>After an hour and a half, our trail came to an end.  we stood
looking at nothing over the edge of something.  Nowhere, during the
entire time, had we come upon a decent way up.  I stretched out, my
head and shoulders over the edge, Kelly holding onto my ankles, and I
looked as far as I could to the right and up.  There was nothing in
sight that was worth a facing movement.</p>
<p>"Hope the others had better luck," I said, after they'd dragged me
back.</p>
<p>"And if they haven't...?" asked Kelly.</p>
<p>"Let's wait."</p>
<p>They had.</p>
<p>It was risky, though.</p>
<p>There was no good way straight up out of the gap.  The trail had
ended at a forty-foot wall which, when mounted, gave a clear view all
the way down.  Leaning out as I had done and looking about two hundred
feet to the left and eighty feet higher, however, Mallardi had rested
his eyes on a rough way, but a way, nevertheless, leading up and west
and vanishing.</p>
<p>We camped in the gap that night.  In the morning, I anchored my
line to a rock, Doc tending, and went out with the pneumatic pistol.
I fell twice, and made forty feet of trail by lunchtime.</p>
<p>I rubbed my bruises then, and Henry took over.  After ten feet,
Kelly got out to anchor a couple of body-lengths behind him, and we
tended Kelly.</p>
<p>Then Stan blasted and Mallardi anchored.  Then there had to be
three on the face.  Then four.  By sundown, we'd made a hundred-fifty
feet and were covered with white powder.  A bath would have been nice.
We settled for ultrasonic shakedowns.</p>
<p>By lunch the next day, we were all out there, roped together, hugging
cold stone, moving slowly, painfully, slowly, not looking down much.</p>
<p>By day's end, we'd made it across, to the place where we could
hold on and feel something--granted, not much--beneath our boots.  It
was inclined to be a trifle scant, however, to warrant less than a
full daylight assault.  So we returned once more to the gap.</p>
<p>In the morning, we crossed.</p>
<p>The way kept its winding angle.  We headed west and up.  We
traveled a mile and made five hundred feet.  We traveled another mile
and made perhaps three hundred.</p>
<p>Then a ledge occurred, about forty feet overhead.</p>
<p>Stan went up the hard way, using the gun, to see what he could
see.</p>
<p>He gestured, and we followed; and the view that broke upon us was
good.</p>
<p>Down right, irregular but wide enough, was our new camp.</p>
<p>The way above it, ice cream and whiskey sours and morning coffee
and a cigarette after dinner.  It was beautiful and delicious: a
seventy-degree slope full of ledges and projections and good clean
stone.</p>
<p>"Hot damn!" said Kelly.</p>
<p>We all tended to agree.</p>
<p>We ate and we drank and we decided to rest our bruised selves that
afternoon.</p>
<p>We were in the twilight world now, walking where no man had ever
walked before, and we felt ourselves to be golden.  It was good to
stretch out and try to unache.</p>
<p>I slept away the day, and when I awakened the sky was a bed of
glowing embers.  I lay there too lazy to move, too full of sight to go
back to sleep.  A meteor burnt its way bluewhite across the heavens.
After a time, there was another.  I thought upon my position and
decided that reaching it was worth the price.  The cold, hard
happiness of the heights filled me.  I wiggled my toes.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, I stretched and sat up.  I regarded the
sleeping forms of my companions.  I looked out across the night as far
as I could see.  Then I looked up at the mountain, then dropped my
eyes slowly among tomorrow's trail.</p>
<p>There was movement within shadow.</p>
<p>Something was standing about fifty feet away and ten feet above.</p>
<p>I picked up my pick and stood.</p>
<p>I crossed the fifty and stared up.</p>
<p>She was smiling, not burning.</p>
<p>A woman, an impossible woman.</p>
<p>Absolutely impossible.  For one thing, she would just have to
freeze to death in a mini-skirt and a sleeveless shell-top.  No
alternative.  For another, she had very little to breath.  Like,
nothing.</p>
<p>But it didn't seem to bother her.  She waved.  Her hair was dark
and long, and I couldn't see her eyes.  The planes of her pale, high
cheeks, wide forehead, small chin corresponded in an unsettling
fashion with certain simple theorems which comprise the geometry of my
heart.  If all angles, planes, curves be correct, it skips a beat,
then hurries to make up for it.</p>
<p>I worked it out, felt it do so, said, "Hello."</p>
<p>"Hello, Whitey," she replied.</p>
<p>"Come down," I said.</p>
<p>"No, you come up."</p>
<p>I swung my pick.  When I reached the ledge she wasn't there.  I
looked around, then I saw her.</p>
<p>She was seated on a rock twelve feet above me.</p>
<p>"How is it that you know my name?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Anyone can see what your name must be."</p>
<p>"All right," I agreed.  "What's yours?"</p>
<p>"..."  Her lips seemed to move, but I heard nothing.</p>
<p>"Come again?"</p>
<p>"I don't want a name," she said.</p>
<p>"Okay.  I'll call you 'girl,' then."</p>
<p>She laughed, sort of.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Watching you."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"To see whether you'll fall."</p>
<p>"I can save you the trouble," I said.  "I won't."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," she said.</p>
<p>"Come down here."</p>
<p>"No, you come up here."</p>
<p>I climbed, but when I got there she was twenty feet higher.</p>
<p>"Girl, you climb well," I said, and she laughed and turned away.</p>
<p>I pursued her for five minutes and couldn't catch her.  There was
something unnatural about the way she moved.</p>
<p>I stopped climbing when she turned again.  We were still about
twenty feet apart.</p>
<p>"I take it you do not really wish me to join you," I said.</p>
<p>"Of course I do, but you must catch me first."  And she turned
once more, and I felt a certain fury within me.</p>
<p>It was written that no one could outclimb Mad Jack.  I had written
it.</p>
<p>I swung my pick and moved like a lizard.</p>
<p>I was near to her a couple of times, but never near enough.</p>
<p>The day's aches began again in my muscles, but I pulled my way up
without slackening my pace.  I realized, faintly, that the camp was
far below me now, and that I was climbing alone through the dark up a
strange slope.  But I did not stop.  Rather, I hurried, and my breath
began to come hard in my lungs.  I heard her laughter, and it was a
goad.  Then I came upon a two-inch ledge, and she was moving along it.
I followed, around a big bulge of rock to where it ended.  Then she
was ninety feet above me, at the top of a smooth pinnacle.  It was
like a tapering, branchless tree.  How she'd accomplished it, I didn't
know.  I was gasping by then, but I looped my line around it and began
to climb.  As I did this, she spoke:</p>
<p>"Don't you ever tire, Whitey?  I thought you would have collapsed
by now."</p>
<p>I hitched up the line and climbed further.</p>
<p>"You can't make it up here, you know."</p>
<p>"I don't know," I grunted.</p>
<p>"Why do you want so badly to climb here?  There are other nice
mountains."</p>
<p>"This is the biggest, girl.  That's why."</p>
<p>"It can't be done."</p>
<p>"Then why all this bother to discourage me?  Why not just let the
mountain do it?"</p>
<p>As I neared her, she vanished.  I made it to the top, where she
had been standing, and I collapsed there.</p>
<p>Then I heard her voice again and turned my head.  She was on a
ledge, perhaps eighty feet away.</p>
<p>"I didn't think you'd make it this far," she said.  "You are a
fool.  Good-by, Whitey."  She was gone.</p>
<p>I sat there on the pinnacle's tiny top--perhaps four square feet of
top--and I know that I couldn't sleep there, because I'd fall.  And I
was tired.</p>
<p>I recalled my favorite curses and I said them all, but I didn't
feel any better.  I couldn't let myself go to sleep.  I looked down.
I knew the way was long.  I knew she didn't think I could make it.</p>
<p>I began the descent.</p>
<p>The following morning when they shook me, I was still tired.  I told
them the last night's tale, and they didn't believe me.  Not until
later in the day, that is, when I detoured us around the bulge and
showed them the pinnacle, standing there like a tapering, branchless
tree, ninety feet in the middle of the air.</p>
</section><section>

<title><p>V</p></title>


<p>We went steadily upward for the next two days.  We made slightly under
ten thousand feet.  Then we spent a day hammering and hacking our way
up a great flat face.  Six hundred feet of it.  Then our way was to
the right and upward.  Before long we were ascending the western side
of the mountain.  When we broke ninety thousand feet, we stopped to
congratulate ourselves that we had just surpassed the Kasla climb and
to remind ourselves that we had not hit the halfway mark.  It took us
another two and a half days to do that, and by then the land lay like
a map beneath us.</p>
<p>And then, that night, we all saw the creature with the sword.</p>
<p>He came and stood near our camp, and he raised his sword above his
head, and it blazed with such a terrible intensity that I slipped on
my goggles.  His voice was all thunder and lightning this time:</p>
<p>"_Get off this mountain!_" he said.  "_Now!  Turn back!  Go down!
Depart!_"</p>
<p>And then a shower of stones came down from above and rattled about
us.  Doc tossed his slim, shiny, case, causing it to skim along the
ground toward the creature.</p>
<p>The light went out, and we were alone.</p>
<p>Doc retrieved his case, took tests, met with the same success as
before--_i.e._, none.  But now at least he didn't think I was some kind
of balmy, unless of course he thought we all were.</p>
<p>"Not a very effective guardian," Henry suggested.</p>
<p>"We've a long way to go yet," said Vince, shying a stone through
the space the creature had occupied.  "I don't like it if the thing
can cause a slide."</p>
<p>"That was just a few pebbles," said Stan.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but what if he decided to start them fifty thousand feet
higher?"</p>
<p>"Shut up!" said Kelly.  "Don't give him any idea.  He might be
listening."</p>
<p>For some reason, we drew closer together.  Doc made each of us
describe what we had seen, and it appeared that we all had seen the
same thing.</p>
<p>"All right," I said, after we'd finished.  "Now you've all seen
it, who wants to go back?"</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>After perhaps half a dozen heartbeats, Henry said, "I want the
whole story.  It looks like a good one.  I'm willing to take my
chances with angry energy creatures to get it."</p>
<p>"I don't know what the thing is," said Kelly.  "Maybe it's no
energy creature.  Maybe it's something--supernatural--I know what you'll
say, Doc.  I'm just telling you how it struck me.  If there are such
things, this seems a good place for them.  Point is--whatever it is, I
don't care.  I want this mountain.  If it could have stopped us, I
think it would've done it already.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it can.
Maybe it's laid some trap for us higher up.  But I want this mountain.
Right now, it means more to me than anything.  If I don't go up, I'll
spend all my time wondering about it--and then I'll probably come back
and try it again some day, when it gets so I can't stand thinking
about it any more.  Only then, maybe the rest of you won't be
available.  Let's face it, we're a good climbing team.  Maybe the best
in the business.  Probably.  If it can be done, I think we can do it."</p>
<p>"I'll second that," said Stan.</p>
<p>"What you said, Kelly," said Mallardi, "about it being
supernatural--it's funny, because I felt the same thing for a minute
when I was looking at it.  It reminds me of something out of the
_Divine Comedy_.  If you recall, Purgatory was a mountain.  And then I
thought of the angel who guarded the eastern way to Eden.  Eden had
gotten moved to the top of Purgatory by Dante--and there was this
angel....Anyhow, I felt almost like I was committing some sin I didn't
know about by being here.  But now that I think it over, a man can't
be guilty of something he doesn't know is wrong, can he?  And I didn't
see that thing flashing any angel ID card.  So I'm willing to go up
and see what's on top, unless he comes back with the Tablets of the
Law, with a new one written in at the bottom."</p>
<p>"In Hebrew or Italian?" asked Doc.</p>
<p>"To satisfy you, I suppose they'd have to be drawn up in the form
of equations."</p>
<p>"No," he said.  "Kidding aside, I felt something funny too, when I
saw and heard it.  And we didn't really hear it, you know.  It skipped
over the senses and got its message right into our brains.  If you
think back over our descriptions of what we experienced, we each
'heard' different words telling us to go away.  If it can communicate
a meaning as well as a pyschtranslator, I wonder if it can communicate
an emotion, also....You thought of an angel too, didn't you, Whitey?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said.</p>
<p>"That makes it almost unanimous then, doesn't it?"</p>
<p>Then we all turned to Vince, because he had no Christian
background at all, having been raised as a Buddhist on Ceylon.</p>
<p>"What were your feelings concerning the thing?" Doc asked him.</p>
<p>"It was a Deva," he said, "which is sort of like an angel, I
guess.  I had the impression that every step I took up this mountain
gave me enough bad karma to fill a lifetime.  Except I haven't
believed in it that way since I was a kid.  I want to go ahead, up.
Even if that feeling was correct, I want to see the top of this
mountain."</p>
<p>"So do I," said Doc.</p>
<p>"That makes it unanimous," I said.</p>
<p>"Well, everyone hang onto his angelsbane," said Stan, "and let's
sack out."</p>
<p>"Good idea."</p>
<p>"Only let's spread out a bit," said Doc, "so that anything falling
won't get all of us together."</p>
<p>We did that cheerful thing and slept untroubled by heaven.</p>
<p>Our way kept winding right, until we were at a hundred forty-four
thousand feet and were mounting the southern slopes.  Then it jogged
back, and by a hundred fifty we were mounting to the west once more.</p>
<p>Then, during a devilish, dark and tricky piece of scaling, up a
smooth, concave bulge ending in an overhang, the bird came down once
again.</p>
<p>If we hadn't been roped together, Stan would have died.  As it
was, we almost all died.</p>
<p>Stan was lead man, as its wings splashed sudden flames against the
violet sky.  It came down from the overhang as though someone had
kicked a bonfire over its edge, headed straight toward him and faded
out at a distance of about twelve feet.  He fell then, almost taking
the rest of us with him.</p>
<p>We tensed our muscles and took the shock.</p>
<p>He was battered a bit, but unbroken.  We made it up to the
overhang, but went no further that day.</p>
<p>Rocks did fall, but we found another overhang and made camp
beneath it.</p>
<p>The bird did not return that day, but the snakes came.</p>
<p>Big, shimmering scarlet serpents coiled about the crags, wound in
and out of jagged fields of ice and gray stone.  Sparks shot along
their sinuous lengths.  They coiled and unwound, stretched and turned,
spat fires at us.  It seemed they were trying to drive us from beneath
the sheltering place to where the rocks could come down upon us.</p>
<p>Doc advanced upon the nearest one, and it vanished as it came
within the field of his projector.  He studied the place where it had
lain, then hurried back.</p>
<p>"The frost is still on the punkin," he said.</p>
<p>"Huh?" said I.</p>
<p>"Not a bit of ice was melted beneath it."</p>
<p>"Indicating?"</p>
<p>"Illusion," said Vince, and he threw a stone at another and it
passed through the thing.</p>
<p>"But you saw what happened to my pick," I said to Doc, "when I
took a cut at that bird.  The thing had to have been carrying some
sort of charge."</p>
<p>"Maybe whatever has been sending them has cut that part out, as a
waste of energy," he replied, "since the things can't get through to
us anyhow."</p>
<p>We sat around and watched the snakes and falling rocks, until Stan
produced a deck of cards and suggested a better game.</p>
<p>The snakes stayed on through the night and followed us the next day.
Rocks still fell periodically, but the boss seemed to be running low
on them.  The bird appeared, circled us and swooped on four different
occasions.  But this time we ignored it, and finally it went home to
roost.</p>
<p>We made three thousand feet, could have gone more, but didn't want
to press it past a cozy little ledge with a cave big enough for the
whole party.  Everything let up on us then.  Everything visible, that
is.</p>
<p>A before-the-storm feeling, a still, electrical tension, seemed to
occur around us then, and we waited for whatever was going to happen
to happen.</p>
<p>The worst possible thing happened: nothing.</p>
<p>This keyed-up feeling, this expectancy, stayed with us, was
unsatisfied.  I think it would actually have been a relief if some
invisible orchestra had begun playing Wagner, or if the heavens had
rolled aside like curtains and revealed a movie screen, and from the
backward lettering we knew we were on the other side, or if we saw a
high-flying dragon eating low-flying weather satellites....</p>
<p>As it was, we just kept feeling that something was imminent, and
it gave me insomnia.</p>
<p>During the night, she came again.  The pinnacle girl.</p>
<p>She stood at the mouth of the cave, and when I advanced the
retreated.</p>
<p>I stopped just inside and stood there myself, where she had been
standing.</p>
<p>She said, "Hello, Whitey."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not going to follow you again," I said.</p>
<p>"I didn't ask you to."</p>
<p>"What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?"</p>
<p>"Watching," she said.</p>
<p>"I told you I won't fall."</p>
<p>"Your friend almost did."</p>
<p>"'Almost' isn't good enough."</p>
<p>"You are the leader, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"If you were to die, the others would go back?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, "they'd go on without me."</p>
<p>I hit my camera then.</p>
<p>"What did you just do?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I took your picture--if you're really there."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"To look at after you go away.  I like to look at pretty things."</p>
<p>"..."  She seemed to say something.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"...die."</p>
<p>"Please speak up."</p>
<p>"She dies..." she said.</p>
<p>"Why?  How?"</p>
<p>"....on mountain."</p>
<p>"I don't understand."</p>
<p>"...too."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>I took a step forward, and she retreated a step.</p>
<p>"Follow me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Go back," she said.</p>
<p>"What's on the other side of that record?"</p>
<p>"You will continue to climb?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Then, "Good!" she said suddenly.  "I--," and her voice stopped
again.</p>
<p>"Go back," she finally said, without emotion.</p>
<p>"Sorry."</p>
<p>And she was gone.</p>

<p>Our trail took us slowly to the left once more.  We crawled and
sprawled and cut holes in the stone.  Snakes sizzled in the distance.
They were with us constantly now.  The bird came again at crucial
moments, to try to make us fall.  A raging bull stood on a crag and
bellowed down at us.  Phantom archers loosed shafts of fire, which
always faded right before they struck.  Blazing blizzards swept at us,
around us, were gone.  We were back on the northern slopes and still
heading west by the time we broke a hundred sixty thousand.  The sky
was deep and blue, and there were always stars.  Why did the mountain
hate us? I wondered.  What was there about us to provoke this thing?
I looked at the picture of the girl for the dozenth time and I
wondered what she really was.  Had she been picked from our minds and
composed into girlform to lure us, to lead us, sirenlike, harpylike,
to the place of the final fall?  It was such a long way down....</p>
<p>I thought back over my life.  How does a man come to climb
mountains?  Is he drawn by the heights because he is afraid of the
level land?  Is he such a misfit in the society of men that he must
flee and try to place himself above it?  The way up is long and
difficult, but if he succeeds they must grant him a garland of sorts.
And if he falls, this too is a kind of glory.  To end, hurled from the
heights to the depths in hideous ruin and combustion down, is a
fitting climax for the loser--for it, too, shakes mountains and minds,
stirs things like thoughts below both, is a kind of blasted garland of
victory in defeat, and cold, so cold that final action, that the
movement is somewhere frozen forever into a statuelike rigidity of
ultimate intent and purpose thwarted only by the universal malevolence
we all fear exists.  An aspirant saint or hero who lacks some
necessary virtue may still qualify as a martyr, for the only thing
that people will really remember in the end is the end.  I had known
that I'd had to climb Kasla, as I had climbed all the others, and I
had known what the price would me.  It had cost me my only home.  But
Kasla was there, and my boots cried out for my feet.  I knew as I did
so that somewhere I set them upon her summit, and below me a world was
ending.  What's a world if the moment of victory is at hand?  And if
truth, beauty and goodness be one, why is there always this conflict
among them?</p>
<p>The phantom archers fired upon me and the bright bird swooped.  I
set my teeth, and my boots scarred rocks beneath me.</p>
<p>We saw the top.</p>
<p>At a hundred seventy-six thousand feet, making our way along a
narrow ledge, clicking against rock, testing our way with our picks,
we heard Vince say, "Look!"</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>Up and up, and again further, bluefrosted and sharp, deadly, and
cold as Loki's dagger, slashing at the sky, it vibrated above us like
electricity, hung like a piece of frozen thunder, and cut, cut, cut
into the center of spirit that was desire, twisted, and became a
fishhook to pull us on, to burn us with its barbs.</p>
<p>Vince was the first to look up and see the top, the first to die.
It happened so quickly, and it was none of the terrors that achieved
it.</p>
<p>He slipped.</p>
<p>That was all.  It was a difficult piece of climbing.  He was right
behind me one second, was gone the next.  There was no body to
recover.  He'd taken the long drop.  The soundless blue was all around
him and the great gray beneath.  Then we were six.  We shuddered, and
I suppose we all prayed in our own ways.</p>
<p>--Gone Vince, may some good Deva lead you up the Path of Splendor.
May you find whatever you wanted most at the other end, waiting there
for you.  If such a thing may be, remember those who say these words,
oh strong intruder in the sky....</p>
<p>No one spoke much for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>The fiery sword bearer came and stood above our camp the entire
night.  It did not speak.</p>
<p>In the morning, Stan was gone, and there was a note beneath my
pack.</p>
<p>_Don't hate me,_ it said, _for running out, but I think it</p>
<p>really is an angel.  I'm scared of this mountain.  I'll climb</p>
<p>any pile of rocks, but I won't fight Heaven.  The way down is</p>
<p>easier than the way up, so don't worry about me.  Good luck.</p>
<p>Try to understand._                                S</p>
<p>So we were five--Doc and Kelly and Henry and Mallardi and me--and
that day we hit a hundred eighty thousand and felt very alone.</p>
<p>The girl came again that night and spoke to me, black hair against
black sky and eyes like points of blue fire, and she stood beside an
icy pillar and said, "Two of you have gone."</p>
<p>"And the rest of us remain," I replied.</p>
<p>"For a time."</p>
<p>"We will climb to the top and then we will go away," I said.  "How
can that do you harm?  Why do you hate us?"</p>
<p>"No hate, sir," she said.</p>
<p>"What, then?"</p>
<p>"I protect."</p>
<p>"What?  What is it that you protect?"</p>
<p>"The dying, that she may live."</p>
<p>"What?  Who is dying?  How?"</p>
<p>But her words went away somewhere, and I did not hear them.  Then
she went away too, and there was nothing left but sleep for the rest
of the night.</p>
<p>One hundred eighty-two thousand and three, and four, and five.  Then
back down to four for the following night.</p>
<p>The creatures whined about us now, and the land pulsed beneath us,
and the mountain seemed sometimes to sway as we climbed.</p>
<p>We carved a path to one eighty-six, and for three days we fought
to gain another thousand feet.  Everything we touched was cold and
slick and slippery, sparkled, and had a bluish haze about it.</p>
<p>When we hit one ninety, Henry looked back and shuddered.</p>
<p>"I'm no longer worried about making it to the top," he said.
"It's the return trip that's bothering me now.  The clouds are like
little wisps of cotton way down there."</p>
<p>"The sooner up, the sooner down," I said, and we began to climb
once again.</p>
<p>It took us another week to cut our way to within a mile of the
top.  All the creatures of fire had withdrawn, but two ice avalanches
showed us we were still unwanted.  We survived the first without
mishap, but Kelly sprained his right ankle during the second, and Doc
thought he might have cracked a couple of ribs, too.</p>
<p>We made a camp.  Doc stayed there with him; Henry and Mallardi and
I pushed on up the last mile.</p>
<p>Now the going was beastly.  It had become a mountain of glass.  We
had to hammer out a hold for every foot we made.  We worked in shifts.
We fought for everything we gained.  Our packs became monstrous loads
and our fingers grew numb.  Our defense system--the projectors--seemed
to be wearing down, or else something was increasing its efforts to get
us, because the snakes kept slithering closer, burning brighter.  They
hurt my eyes, and I cursed them.</p>
<p>When we were within a thousand feet of the top, we dug in and made
another camp.  The next couple hundred feet looked easier, then a
rotten spot, and I couldn't tell what it was like above that.</p>
<p>When we awakened, there was just Henry and myself.  There was no
indication of where Mallardi had gotten to.  Henry switched his
communicator to Doc's letter and called below.  I tuned in in time to
hear him say, "Haven't seen him."</p>
<p>"How's Kelly?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Better," he replied.  "Those ribs might not be cracked at that."</p>
<p>Then Mallardi called us.</p>
<p>"I'm four hundred feet above you, fellows," his voice came in.
"It was easy up to here, but the going's just gotten rough again."</p>
<p>"Why'd you cut out on your own?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Because I think something's going to try to kill me before too
long," he said.  "It's up ahead, waiting at the top.  You can probably
even see it from there.  It's a snake."</p>
<p>Henry and I used the binoculars.</p>
<p>Snake?  A better word might be dragon--or maybe even Midgard
Serpent.</p>
<p>It was coiled around the peak, head upraised.  It seemed to be
several hundred feet in length, and it moved its head from side to
side, and up and down, and it smoked solar coronas.</p>
<p>Then I spotted Mallardi climbing toward it.</p>
<p>"Don't go any further!" I called.  "I don't know whether your unit
will protect you against anything like that!  Wait'll I call Doc--"</p>
<p>"Not a chance," he said.  "This baby is mine."</p>
<p>"Listen!  You can be first on the mountain, if that's what you
want!  But don't tackle that thing alone!"</p>
<p>A laugh was the only reply.</p>
<p>"All three units might hold it off," I said.  "Wait for us."</p>
<p>There was no answer, and we began to climb.</p>
<p>I left Henry far below me.  The creature was a moving light in the
sky.  I made two hundred feet in a hurry, and when I looked up again,
I saw that the creature had grown two more heads.  Lightnings flashed
from its nostrils, and its tail whipped around the mountain.  I made
another hundred feet, and I could see Mallardi clearly by then,
climbing steadily, outlined against the brilliance.  I swung my pick,
gasping, and I fought the mountain, following the trail he had cut.  I
began to gain on him, because he was still pounding out his way and I
didn't have that problem.  Then I heard him talking:</p>
<p>"Not yet, big fella, not yet," he was saying, from behind a wall
of static.  "Here's a ledge...."</p>
<p>I looked up, and he vanished.</p>
<p>Then that fiery tail came lashing down toward where I had last
seen him, and I heard him curse and I felt the vibrations of his
pneumatic gun.  The tail snapped back again, and I heard another
"Damn!"</p>
<p>I made haste, stretching and racking myself and grabbing at the holds
he had cut, and then I heard him burst into song.  Something from
_Aida_, I think.</p>
<p>"Damn it!  Wait up!" I said.  "I'm only a few hundred feet
behind."</p>
<p>He kept on singing.</p>
<p>I was beginning to get dizzy, but I couldn't let myself slow down.
My right arm felt like a piece of wood, my left like a piece of ice.
My feet were hooves, and my eyes burned in my head.</p>
<p>Then it happened.</p>
<p>Like a bomb, the snake and the swinging ended in a flash of
brilliance that caused me to sway and almost lose my grip.  I clung to
the vibrating mountainside and squeezed my eyes against the light.</p>
<p>"Mallardi?" I called.</p>
<p>No answer.  Nothing.</p>
<p>I looked down.  Henry was still climbing.  I continued to climb.</p>
<p>I reached the ledge Mallardi had mentioned, found him there.</p>
<p>His respirator was still working.  His protective suit was
blackened and scorched on the right side.  Half of his pick had been
melted away.  I raised his shoulders.</p>
<p>I turned up the volume on the communicator and heard him
breathing.  His eyes opened, closed, opened.</p>
<p>"Okay...." he said.</p>
<p>"'Okay,' hell!  Where do you hurt?"</p>
<p>"No place...I feel jus' fine....Listen!  I think it's used up its
juice for awhile....Go plant the flag.  Prop me up here first, though.
I wanna watch...."</p>
<p>I got him into a better position, squirted the water bulb,
listened to him swallow.  Then I waited for Henry to catch up.  It
took about six minutes.</p>
<p>"I'll stay here," said Henry, stooping beside him.  "You go do
it."</p>
<p>I started up the final slope.</p>
</section><section>

<title><p>VII</p></title>


<p>I swung and I cut and I blasted and I crawled.  Some of the ice had
been melted, the rocks scorched.</p>
<p>Nothing came to oppose me.  The static had gone with the dragon.
There was silence, and darkness between stars.</p>
<p>I climbed slowly, still tired from that last sprint, but
determined not to stop.</p>
<p>All but sixty feet of the entire world lay beneath me, and heaven
hung above me, and a rocket winked overhead.  Perhaps it was the
pressmen, with zoom cameras.</p>
<p>Fifty feet....</p>
<p>No bird, no archer, no angel, no girl.</p>
<p>Forty feet....</p>
<p>I started to shake.  It was nervous tension.  I steadied myself,
went on.</p>
<p>Thirty feet...and the mountain seemed to be swaying now.</p>
<p>Twenty-five...and I grew dizzy, halted, took a drink.</p>
<p>Then click, click, my pick again.</p>
<p>Twenty....</p>
<p>Fifteen....</p>
<p>Ten....</p>
<p>I braced myself against the mountain's final assault, whatever it
might be.</p>
<p>Five...</p>
<p>Nothing happened as I arrived.</p>
<p>I stood up.  I could go no higher.</p>
<p>I looked at the sky, I looked back down.  I waved at the blazing
rocket exhaust.</p>
<p>I extruded the pole and attached the flag.</p>
<p>I planted it, there where no breezes would ever stir it.  I cut in
my communicator, said, "I'm here."</p>
<p>No other words.</p>
<p>It was time to go back down and give Henry his chance, but I looked
down the western slope before I turned to go.</p>
<p>The lady was winking again.  Perhaps eight hundred feet below, the
red light shone.  Could that have been what I had seen from the town
during the storm, on that night, so long ago?</p>
<p>I didn't know and I had to.</p>
<p>I spoke into the communicator.</p>
<p>"How's Mallardi doing?"</p>
<p>"I just stood up," he answered.  "Give me another half hour, and
I'm coming up myself."</p>
<p>"Henry," I said.  "Should he?"</p>
<p>"Gotta take his word how he feels," said Lanning.</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "then take it easy.  I'll be gone when you get
here.  I'm going a little way down the western side.  Something I want
to see."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I dunno.  That's why I want to see."</p>
<p>"Take care."</p>
<p>"Check."</p>
<p>The western slope was an easy descent.  As I went down it, I
realized that the light was coming from an opening in the side of the
mountain.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, I stood before it.</p>
<p>I stepped within and was dazzled.</p>
<p>I walked toward it and stopped.  It pulsed and quivered and sang.</p>
<p>A vibrating wall of flame leapt from the floor of the cave,
towered to the roof of the cave.</p>
<p>It blocked my way, when I wanted to go beyond it.</p>
<p>She was there, and I wanted to reach her.</p>
<p>I took a step forward, so that I was only inches away from it.  My
communicator was full of static and my arms of cold needles.</p>
<p>It did not bend toward me, as to attack.  It cast no heat.</p>
<p>I stared through the veil of fires to where she reclined, her eyes
closed, her breast unmoving.</p>
<p>I stared at the bank of machinery beside the far wall.</p>
<p>"I'm here," I said, and I raised my pick.</p>
<p>When its point touched the wall of flame someone took the lid off
hell, and I staggered back, blinded.  When my vision cleared, the
angel stood before me.</p>
<p>"_You may not pass here_," he said.</p>
<p>"She is the reason you want me to go back?" I asked.</p>
<p>"_Yes.  Go back._"</p>
<p>"Has she no say in the matter?"</p>
<p>"_She sleeps.  Go back._"</p>
<p>"So I notice.  Why?"</p>
<p>"_She must.  Go back._"</p>
<p>"Why did she herself appear to me and lead me strangely?"</p>
<p>"_I used up the fear-forms I knew.  They did not work.  I led you
strangely because her sleeping mind touches upon my own workings.  It
did so especially when I borrowed her form, so that it interfered with
the directive.  Go back._"</p>
<p>"What is the directive?"</p>
<p>"_She is to be guarded against all things coming up the mountain.
Go back._"</p>
<p>"Why?  Why is she guarded?"</p>
<p>"_She sleeps.  Go back._"</p>
<p>The conversation having become somewhat circular at that point, I
reached into my pack and drew out the projector.  I swung it forward
and the angel melted.  The flames bent away from my outstretched
hand.  I sought to open a doorway in the circle of fire.</p>
<p>It worked, sort of.</p>
<p>I pushed the projector forward, and the flames bent and bent and
bent and finally broke.  When they broke, I leaped forward.  I made it
through, but my protective suit was as scorched as Mallardi's.</p>
<p>I moved to the coffinlike locker within which she slept.</p>
<p>I rested my hands on its edge and looked down.</p>
<p>She was as fragile as ice.</p>
<p>In fact, she was ice....</p>
<p>The machine came alive with lights then, and I felt her somber
bedstead vibrate.</p>
<p>Then I saw the man.</p>
<p>He was half sprawled across a metal chair beside the machine.</p>
<p>He, too, was ice.  Only his features were gray, were twisted.  He
wore black and he was dead and a statue, while she was sleeping and a
statue.</p>
<p>She wore blue, and white....</p>
<p>There was an empty casket in the far corner....</p>
<p>But something was happening around me.  There came a brightening
of the air.  Yes, it was air.  It hissed upward from frosty juts in
the floor, formed into great clouds.  Then a feeling of heat occurred
and the clouds began to fade and the brightening continued.</p>
<p>I returned to the casket and studied her features.</p>
<p>I wondered what her voice would sound like when/if she spoke.  I
wondered what lay within her mind.  I wondered how her thinking
worked, and what she liked and didn't like.  I wondered what her eyes
had looked upon, and when.</p>
<p>I wondered all these things, because I could see that whatever
forces I had set into operation when I entered the circle of fire were
causing her, slowly, to cease being a statue.</p>
<p>She was being awakened.</p>
<p>I waited.  Over an hour went by, and still I waited, watching her.
She began to breath.  Her eyes opened at last, and for a long time she
did not see.</p>
<p>Then her bluefire fell on me.</p>
<p>"Whitey," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Where am I...?"</p>
<p>"In the damnedest place I could possibly have found anyone."</p>
<p>She frowned.  "I remember," she said and tried to sit up.</p>
<p>It didn't work.  She fell back.</p>
<p>"What is your name?"</p>
<p>"Linda," she said.  Then, "I dreamed of you, Whitey.  Strange
dreams....How could that be?"</p>
<p>"It's tricky," I said.</p>
<p>"I knew you were coming," she said.  "I saw you fighting monsters
on a mountain as high as the sky."</p>
<p>"Yes, we're there now."</p>
<p>"H-have you the cure?"</p>
<p>"Cure?  What cure?"</p>
<p>"Dawson's Plague," she said.</p>
<p>I felt sick.  I felt sick because I realized that she did not
sleep as a prisoner, but to postpone her death.  She was sick.</p>
<p>"Did you come to live on this world in a ship that moved faster
than light?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No," she said.  "It took centuries to get here.  We slept the
cold sleep during the journey.  This is one of the bunkers."  She
gestured toward the casket with her eyes.  I noticed her cheeks had
become bright red.</p>
<p>"They all began dying--of the plague," she said.  "There was no
cure.  My husband--Carl--is a doctor.  When he saw that I had it, he
said he would keep me in extreme hypothermia until a cure was found.
Otherwise, you only live for two days, you know."</p>
<p>Then she stared up at me, and I realized that her last two words
had been a question.</p>
<p>I moved into a position to block her view of the dead man, who I
feared must be her Carl.  I tried to follow her husband's thinking.
He'd had to hurry, as he was obviously further along than she had
been.  He knew the colony would be wiped out.  He must have loved her
and been awfully clever, both--awfully resourceful.  Mostly, though, he
must have loved her.  Knowing that the colony would die, he knew it
would be centuries before another ship arrived.  He had nothing that
could power a cold bunker for that long.  But up here, on the top of
this mountain, almost as cold as outer space itself, power wouldn't be
necessary.  Somehow, he had got Linda and the stuff up here.  His
machine cast a force field around the cave.  Working in heat and
atmosphere, he had sent her deep into the cold sleep and then prepared
his own bunker.  When he dropped the wall of forces, no power would be
necessary to guarantee the long, icy wait.  They could sleep for
centuries within the bosom of the Gray Sister, protected by a colony
of defense-computer.  This last had apparently been programmed
quickly, for he was dying.  He saw that it was too late to join her.
He hurried to set the thing for basic defense, killed the force field,
and then went his way into that Dark and Secret Place.  Thus it hurled
its birds and its angels and its snakes, it raised its walls of fire
against me.  He died, and it guarded her in near-death--against
everything, including those who would help.  My coming to the mountain
had activated it.  My passing of the defenses had caused her to be
summoned back to life.</p>
<p>"_Go back!_" I heard the machine say through its projected angel,
for Henry had entered the cave.</p>
<p>"My God!" I heard him say.  "Who's that?"</p>
<p>"Get Doc!" I said.  "Hurry!  I'll explain later.  It's a matter of
life!  Climb back to where your communicator will work, and tell him
it's Dawson's Plague--a bad local bug!  Hurry!"</p>
<p>"I'm on my way," he said and was.</p>
<p>"There _is_ a doctor?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes.  Only about two hours away.  Don't worry....I still don't
see how anyone could have gotten you up here to the top of this
mountain, let alone a load of machines."</p>
<p>"We're on the big mountain--the forty-miler?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How did _you_ get up?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I climbed it."</p>
<p>"You really climbed Purgatorio?  On the outside?"</p>
<p>"Purgatorio?  That's what you call it?  Yes, I climbed it, that
way."</p>
<p>"We didn't think it could be done."</p>
<p>"How else might one arrive at its top?"</p>
<p>"It's hollow inside," she said.  "There are great caves and
massive passages.  It's easy to fly up the inside on a pressurized jut
car.  In fact, it was an amusement ride.  Two and a half dollars per
person.  An hour and a half each way.  A dollar to rent a pressurized
suit and take an hour's walk around the top.  Nice way to spend an
afternoon.  Beautiful view...?"  She gasped deeply.</p>
<p>"I don't feel so good," she said.  "Have you any water?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, and I gave her all I had.</p>
<p>As she sipped it, I prayed that Doc had the necessary serum or
else would be able to send her back to ice and sleep until it could be
gotten.  I prayed that he would make good time, for two hours seemed
long when measured against her thirst and the red of her flesh.</p>
<p>"My fever is coming again," she said.  "Talk to me, Whitey,
please....Tell me things.  Keep me with you till he comes.  I don't
want my mind to turn back upon what has happened...."</p>
<p>"What would you like me to tell you about, Linda?"</p>
<p>"Tell me why you did it.  Tell me what it was like, to climb a
mountain like this one.  Why?"</p>
<p>I turned my mind back upon what had happened.</p>
<p>"There is a certain madness involved," I said, "a certain envy of
great and powerful natural forces, that some men have.  Each mountain
is a deity, you know.  Each is an immortal power.  If you make
sacrifices upon its slopes, a mountain may grant you a certain grace,
and for a time you will share this power.  Perhaps that is why they
call me...."</p>
<p>Her hand rested in mine.  I hoped that through it whatever power I
might contain would hold all of her with me for as long as ever
possible.</p>
<p>"I remember the first time that I saw Purgatory, Linda," I told
her.  "I looked at it and I was sick.  I wondered, where did it
lead...?"</p>
<p>(Stars.</p>
<p>Oh let there be.</p>
<p>This once to end with.</p>
<p>Please.)</p>
<p>"Stars?"

<section>

<p>Back on Earth, my old philosophy prof--possibly because he'd misplaced
his lecture notes--came into the classroom one day and scrutinized his
sixteen victims for the space of half a minute.  Satisfied then, that
a sufficiently profound tone had been established, he asked:</p>
<p>"What is a man?"</p>
<p>He had known exactly what he was doing.  He'd had an hour and a
half to kill, and eleven of the sixteen were coeds (nine of them in
liberal arts, and the other two stuck with an Area Requirement).</p>
<p>One of the other two, who was in the pre-med program, proceeded to
provide a strict biological classification.</p>
<p>The prof (McNitt was his name, I suddenly recall) nodded then, and
asked:</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p>
<p>And there was his hour and a half.</p>
<p>I learned that Man is a Reasoning Animal, Man is the One Who
Laughs, Man is greater than beasts but less than angels, Man is the
one who watches himself watching himself doing things he knows are
absurd (this from a Comparative Lit gal), Man is the
culture-transmitting animal, Man is the spirit which aspires, affirms,
loves, the one who uses tools, buries his dead, devises religions, and
the one who tries to define himself.  (That last from Paul Schwartz,
my roommate--which I thought pretty good, on the spur of the moment.
Wonder whatever became of Paul?)</p>
<p>Anyhow, to most of these I say "perhaps" or "partly, but--" or just
plain "crap!"  I still think mine was the best, because I had a chance
to try it out, on Tierra del Cygnus, Land of the Swan...</p>
<p>I'd said, "Man is the sum total of everything he has done, wishes
to do or not to do, and wishes he hadn't done, or hadn't."</p>
<p>Stop and think about it for a minute.  It's purposely as general
as the others, but it's got room in it for the biology and the
laughing and the aspiring, as well as the culture-transmitting, the
love, and the room full of mirrors, and the defining.  I even left the
door open for religion, you'll note.  But it's limiting, too.  Ever
met an oyster to whom the final phrases apply?</p>
<p>Tierra del Cygnus, Land of the Swan--delightful name.</p>
<p>Delightful place too, for quite awhile...</p>
<p>It was there that I saw Man's definitions, one by one, wiped from
off the big blackboard, until only mine was left.</p>
<p>...My radio had been playing more static than usual.  That's all.</p>
<p>For several hours there was no other indication of what was to
come.</p>
<p>My hundred-thirty eyes had watched Betty all morning, on that
clear, cool spring day with the sun pouring down its honey and
lightning upon the amber fields, flowing through the streets, invading
western store-fronts, drying curbstones, and washing the olive and
umber buds that speared the skin of the trees there by the roadway;
and the light that wrung the blue from the flag before Town Hall made
orange mirrors out of windows, chased purple and violet patches across
the shoulders of Saint Stephen's Range, some thirty miles distant, and
came down upon the forest at its feet like some supernatural madman
with a million buckets of paint--each of a different shade of green,
yellow, orange, blue and red--to daub with miles-wide brushes at its
heaving sea of growth.</p>
<p>Mornings the sky is cobalt, midday is turquoise, and sunset is
emeralds and rubies, hard and flashing.  It was halfway between cobalt
and seamist at 1100 hours, when I watched Betty with my hundred-thirty
eyes and saw nothing to indicate what was about to be.  There was only
that persistent piece of static, accompanying the piano and strings
within my portable.</p>
<p>It's funny how the mind personifies, engenders.  Ships are always
women: You say, "She's a good old tub," or, "She's a fast, tough
number, this one," slapping a bulwark and feeling the aura of
femininity that clings to the vessel's curves; or, conversely, "He's a
bastard to start, that Sam!" as you kick the auxiliary engine to an
inland transport-vehicle; and hurricanes are always women, and moons,
and seas.  Cities, though, are different.  Generally, they're neuter.
Nobody calls New York or San Francisco "he" or "she".  Usually, cities
are just "it".</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, they do come to take on the attributes of sex.
Usually, this is in the case of small cities near to the
Mediterranean, back on Earth.  Perhaps this is because of the
sex-ridden nouns of the languages which prevail in that vicinity, in
which case it tells us more about the inhabitants than it does about
the habitations.  But I feel that it goes deeper than that.</p>
<p>Betty was Beta Station for less than ten years.  After two decades
she was Betty officially, by act of Town Council.  Why?  Well, I felt
at the time (ninety-some years ago), and still feel, that it was
because she was what she was--a place of rest and repair, of
surface-cooked meals and of new voices, new faces, of landscapes,
weather, and natural light again, after that long haul through the big
night, with its casting away of so much.  She is not home, she is
seldom destination, but she is like unto both.  When you come upon
light and warmth and music after darkness and cold and silence, it is
Woman.  The oldtime Mediterranean sailor must have felt it when he
first spied port at the end of a voyage.  _I_ felt it when I first saw
Beta Station-Betty-and the second time I saw her, also.</p>
<p>I am her Hell Cop.</p>
<p>...When six or seven of my hundred-thirty eyes flickered, then saw
again, and the music was suddenly washed away by a wave of static, it
was then that I began to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>I called Weather Central for a report, and the recorded girlvoice
told me that seasonal rains were expected in the afternoon or early
evening.  I hung up and switched an eye from ventral to dorsal-vision.</p>
<p>Not a cloud.  Not a ripple.  Only a formation of green-winged
ski-toads, heading north, crossed the field of the lens.</p>
<p>I switched it back, and I watched the traffic flow, slowly, and
without congestion, along Betty's prim, well-tended streets.  Three
men were leaving the bank and two more were entering.  I recognized
the three who were leaving, and in my mind I waved as I passed by.
All was still at the post office, and patterns of normal activity lay
upon the steel mills, the stockyard, the plast-synth plants, the
airport, the spacer pads, and the surfaces of all the shopping
complexes; vehicles came and went at the Inland Transport-Vehicle
garages, crawling from the rainbow forest and the mountains beyond
like dark slugs, leaving tread-trails to mark their comings and goings
through wilderness; and the fields of the countryside were still
yellow and brown, with occasional patches of green and pink; the
country houses, mainly simple A-frame affairs, were chisel blade,
spike-tooth, spire and steeple, each with a big lightning rod, and
dipped in many colors and scooped up in the cups of my seeing and
dumped out again, as I sent my eyes on their rounds and tended my
gallery of one hundred-thirty changing pictures, on the big wall of
the Trouble Center, there atop the Watch Tower of Town Hall.</p>
<p>The static came and went until I had to shut off the radio.
Fragments of music are worse than no music at all.</p>
<p>My eyes, coasting weightless along magnetic lines, began to blink.</p>
<p>I knew then that we were in for something.</p>
<p>I sent an eye scurrying off toward Saint Stephen's at full speed,
which meant a wait of about twenty minutes until it topped the range.
Another, I sent straight up, skywards, which meant perhaps ten minutes
for a long shot of the same scene.  Then I put the auto-scan in full
charge of operations and went downstairs for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I entered the Mayor's outer office, winked at Lottie, the receptionist,
and glanced at the inner door.</p>
<p>"Mayor in?" I asked.</p>
<p>I got an occasional smile from Lottie, a slightly heavy, but
well-rounded girl of indeterminate age and intermittent acne, but this
wasn't one of the occasions.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, returning to the papers on her desk.</p>
<p>"Alone?"</p>
<p>She nodded, and her earrings danced.  Dark eyes and dark
complexion, she could have been kind of sharp, if only she'd fix her
hair and use more makeup.  Well...</p>
<p>I crossed to the door and knocked.</p>
<p>"Who?" asked the Mayor.</p>
<p>"Me," I said, opening it, "Godfrey Justin Holmes--`God' for short.
I want someone to drink coffee with, and you're elected."</p>
<p>She turned in her swivel chair, away from the window she had been
studying, and her blonde-hair-white-hair-fused, short and parted in
the middle, gave a little stir as she turned--like a sunshot snowdrift
struck by sudden winds.</p>
<p>She smiled and said, "I'm busy."</p>
<p>`Eyes green, chin small, cute little ears--I love them all'--from an
anonymous Valentine I'd sent her two months previous, and true.</p>
<p>"...But not too busy to have coffee with God," she stated.  "Have
a throne, and I'll make us some instant."</p>
<p>I did, and she did.</p>
<p>While she was doing it, I leaned back, lit a cigarette I'd
borrowed from her canister, and remarked, "Looks like rain."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh," she said.</p>
<p>"Not just making conversation," I told her.  "There's a bad storm
brewing somewhere--over Saint Stephen's, I think.  I'll know real
soon."</p>
<p>"Yes grandfather," she said, bringing me my coffee.  "You old
timers with all your aches and pains are often better than Weather
Central, it's an established fact.  I won't argue."</p>
<p>She smiled, frowned, then smiled again.</p>
<p>I set my cup on the edge of her desk.</p>
<p>"Just wait and see," I said.  "If it makes it over the mountains,
it'll be a nasty high-voltage job.  It's already jazzing up
reception."</p>
<p>Big-bowed white blouse, and black skirt around a well-kept figure.
She'd be forty in the fall, but she'd never completely tamed her
facial reflexes--which was most engaging, so far as I was concerned.
Spontaneity of expression so often vanishes so soon.  I could see the
sort of child she'd been by looking at her, listening to her now.  The
thought of being forty was bothering her again, too, I could tell.
She always kids me about age when age is bothering her.</p>
<p>See, I'm around thirty-five, actually, which makes me her junior
by a bit, but she'd heard her grandfather speak of me when she was a
kid, before I came back again this last time.  I'd filled out the
balance of his two-year term, back when Betty-Beta's first mayor,
Wyeth, had died after two months in office.  I was born about five
hundred ninety-seven years ago, on Earth, but I spent about five
hundred sixty-two of those years sleeping, during my long jaunts
between the stars.  I've made a few more trips than a few others;
consequently, I am an anachronism.  I am really, of course, only as
old as I look--but still, people always seem to feel that I've cheated
somehow, especially women in their middle years.  Sometimes it is most
disconcerting...</p>
<p>"Eleanor," said I, "your term will be up in November.  Are you
still thinking of running again?"</p>
<p>She took off her narrow, elegantly-trimmed glasses and brushed her
eyelids with thumb and forefinger.  Then she took a sip of coffee.</p>
<p>"I haven't made up my mind."</p>
<p>"I ask not for press-release purposes," I said, "but for my own."</p>
<p>"Really, I haven't decided," she told me.  "I don't know..."</p>
<p>"Okay, just checking.  Let me know if you do."</p>
<p>I drank some coffee.</p>
<p>After a time, she said, "Dinner Saturday?  As usual?"</p>
<p>"Yes, good."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you then."</p>
<p>"Fine--capital."</p>
<p>As she looked down into her coffee, I saw a little girl staring
into a pool, waiting for it to clear, to see her reflection or to see
the bottom of the pool, or perhaps both.</p>
<p>She smiled at whatever it was she finally saw.</p>
<p>"A bad storm?" she asked me.</p>
<p>"Yep.  Feel it in my bones."</p>
<p>"Tell it to go away?"</p>
<p>"Tried.  Don't think it will, though."</p>
<p>"Better batten some hatches, then."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't hurt and it might help."</p>
<p>"The weather satellite will be overhead in another half hour.
You'll have something sooner?"</p>
<p>"Think so.  Probably any minute."</p>
<p>I finished my coffee, washed out the cup.</p>
<p>"Let me know right away what it is."</p>
<p>"Check.  Thanks for the coffee."</p>
<p>Lottie was still working and did not look up as I passed.</p>
<p>Upstairs again, my highest eye was now high enough.  I stood it on its
tail and collected a view of the distance: Fleecy mobs of clouds
boiled and frothed on the other side of Saint Stephen's.  The mountain
range seemed a breakwall, a dam, a rocky shoreline.  Beyond it, the
waters were troubled.</p>
<p>My other eye was almost in position.  I waited the space of half a
cigarette, then it delivered me a sight:</p>
<p>Gray, and wet and impenetrable, a curtain across the countryside,
that's what I saw.</p>
<p>...And advancing.</p>
<p>I called Eleanor.</p>
<p>"It's gonna rain, chillun," I said.</p>
<p>"Worth some sandbags?"</p>
<p>"Possibly."</p>
<p>"Better be ready then.  Okay.  Thanks."</p>
<p>I returned to my watching.</p>
<p>Tierra del Cygnus, Land of the Swan--delightful name.  It refers to
both the planet and its sole continent.</p>
<p>How to describe the world, like quick?  Well, roughly Earth-size;
actually, a bit smaller, and more watery.  --As for the main landmass,
first hold a mirror up to South America, to get the big bump from the
right side over to the left, then rotate it ninety degrees in a
counter-clockwise direction and push it up into the northern
hemisphere.  Got that?  Good.  Now grab it by the tail and pull.
Stretch it another six or seven hundred miles, slimming down the
middle as you do, and let the last five or six hundred fall across the
equator.  There you have Cygnus, its big gulf partly in the tropics,
partly not.  Just for the sake of thoroughness, while you're about it,
break Australia into eight pieces and drop them after the first eight
letters in the Greek alphabet.  Put a big scoop of vanilla at each
pole, and don't forget to tilt the globe about eighteen degrees before
you leave.  Thanks.</p>
<p>I recalled my wandering eyes, and I kept a few of the others
turned toward Saint Stephen's until the cloudbanks breasted the range
about an hour later.  By then, though, the weather satellite had
passed over and picked the thing up also.  It reported quite an
extensive cloud cover on the other side.  The storm had sprung up
quickly, as they often do here on Cygnus.  Often, too, they disperse
just as quickly, after an hour or so of heaven's artillery.  But then
there are the bad ones--sometimes lingering and lingering, and bearing
more thunderbolts in their quivers than any Earth storm.</p>
<p>Betty's position, too, is occasionally precarious, though its
advantages, in general, offset its liabilities.  We are located on the
gulf, about twenty miles inland, and are approximately three miles
removed (in the main) from a major river, the Noble; part of Betty
does extend down to its banks, but this is a smaller part.  We are
almost a strip city, falling mainly into an area some seven miles in
length and two miles wide, stretching inland, east from the river, and
running roughly parallel to the distant seacoast.  Around eighty
percent of the 100,000 population is concentrated about the business
district, five miles in from the river.</p>
<p>We are not the lowest land about, but we are far from being the
highest.  We are certainly the most level in the area.  This latter
feature, as well as our nearness to the equator, was a deciding factor
in the establishment of Beta Station.  Some other things were our
proximity both to the ocean and to a large river.  There are nine
other cities on the continent, all of them younger and smaller, and
three of them located upriver from us.  We are the potential capital
of a potential country.</p>
<p>We're a good, smooth, easy landing site for drop-boats from
orbiting interstellar vehicles, and we have major assets for future
growth and coordination when it comes to expanding across the
continent.  Our original _raison d'etre_, though, was Stopover,
repair-point, supply depot, and refreshment stand, physical and
psychological, on the way out to other, more settled worlds, further
along the line.  Cyg was discovered later than many others--it just
happened that way--and the others got off to earlier starts.  Hence,
the others generally attract more colonists.  We are still quite
primitive.  Self-sufficiency, in order to work on our population:land
scale, demanded a society on the order of that of the mid-nineteenth
century in the American southwest--at least for purposes of getting
started.  Even now, Cyg is still partly on a natural economy system,
although Earth Central technically determines the coin of the realm.</p>
<p>Why Stopover, if you sleep most of the way between the stars?</p>
<p>Think about it a while, and I'll tell you later if you're right.</p>
<p>The thunderheads rose in the east, sending billows and streamers
this way and that, until it seemed from the formations that Saint
Stephen's was a balcony full of monsters, leaning and craning their
necks over the rail in the direction of the stage, us.  Cloud piled
upon slate-colored cloud, and then the wall slowly began to topple.</p>
<p>I heard the first rumbles of thunder almost half an hour after
lunch, so I knew it wasn't my stomach.</p>
<p>Despite all my eyes, I moved to a window to watch.  It was like a
big, gray, aerial glacier plowing the sky.</p>
<p>There was a wind now, for I saw the trees suddenly quiver and bow
down.  This would be our first storm of the season.  The turquoise
fell back before it, and finally it smothered the sun itself.  Then
there were drops upon the windowpane, then rivulets.</p>
<p>Flint-like, the highest peaks of Saint Stephen's scraped its belly
and were showered with sparks.  After a moment it bumped into
something with a terrible crash, and the rivulets on the quartz panes
turned back into rivers.</p>
<p>I went back to my gallery, to smile at dozens of views of people
scurrying for shelter.  A smart few had umbrellas and raincoats.  The
rest ran like blazes.  People never pay attention to weather reports;
this, I believe, is a constant factor in man's psychological makeup,
stemming perhaps from an ancient tribal distrust of the shaman.  You
want them to be wrong.  If they're right, then they're somehow
superior, and this is even more uncomfortable than getting wet.</p>
<p>I remembered then that I had forgotten my raincoat, umbrella, and
rubbers.  But it _had_ been a beautiful morning, and W.C. _could_ have
been wrong...</p>
<p>Well, I had another cigarette and leaned back in my big chair.  No
storm in the world could knock my eyes out of the sky.</p>
<p>I switched on the filters and sat and watched the rain pour past.</p>
<p>Five hours later it was still raining, and rumbling and dark.</p>
<p>I'd had hopes that it would let up by quitting time, but when
Chuck Fuller came around the picture still hadn't changed any.  Chuck
was my relief that night, the evening Hell Cop.</p>
<p>He seated himself beside my desk.</p>
<p>"You're early," I said.  "They don't start paying you for another
hour."</p>
<p>"Too wet to do anything but sit.  'Rather sit here than at home."</p>
<p>"Leaky roof?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Mother-in-law.  Visiting again."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"One of the disadvantages of a small world."</p>
<p>He clasped his hands behind his neck and leaned back in the chair,
staring off in the direction of the window.  I could feel one of his
outbursts coming.</p>
<p>"You know how old I am?" he asked, after a while.</p>
<p>"No," I said, which was a lie.  He was twenty-nine.</p>
<p>"Twenty-seven," he told me, "and going to be twenty-eight soon.
Know where I've been?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"No place, that's where!  I was born and raised on this crummy
world!  And I married and I settled down here--and I've never been off
it!  Never could afford it when I was younger.  Now I've got a
family..."</p>
<p>He leaned forward again, rested his elbow on his knees, like a
kid.  Chuck would look like a kid when he was fifty.  --Blond hair,
close-cropped, pug nose, kind of scrawny, takes a suntan quickly, and
well.  Maybe he'd act like a kid at fifty, too.  I'll never know.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything because I didn't have anything to say.</p>
<p>He was quiet for a long while again.</p>
<p>Then he said, "_You've_ been around."</p>
<p>After a minute, he went on:</p>
<p>"You were born on Earth.  Earth!  And you visited lots of other
worlds too, before I was even born.  Earth is only a name to me.  And
pictures.  And all the others--they're the same!  Pictures.  Names..."</p>
<p>I waited, then after I grew tired of waiting I said, "'Miniver
Cheevy, child of scorn...'"</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"It's the ancient beginning to an ancient poem.  It's an ancient
poem now, but it wasn't ancient when I was a boy.  Just old.  _I_ had
friends, relatives, even in-laws, once myself.  They are just bones
now.  They are dust.  Real dust, not metaphorical dust.  The past
fifteen years seem fifteen years to me, the same as to you, but
they're not.  They are already many chapters back in the history
books.  Whenever you travel between the stars you automatically bury
the past.  The world you leave will be filled with strangers if you
ever return--or caricatures of your friends, your relatives, even
yourself.  It's no great trick to be a grandfather at sixty, a
great-grandfather at seventy-five or eighty--but go away for three
hundred years, and then come back and meet your great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson, who
happens to be fifty-five years old, and puzzled, when you look him up.
It shows you just how alone you really are.  You are not simply a man
without a country or without a world.  You are a man without a time.
You and the centuries do not belong to each other.  You are like the
rubbish that drifts between the stars."</p>
<p>"It would be worth it," he said.</p>
<p>I laughed.  I'd had to listen to his gripes every month or two for
over a year and a half.  It had never bothered me much before, so I
guess it was a cumulative effect that day--the rain, and Saturday night
next, and my recent library visits, _and_ his complaining, that had
set me off.</p>
<p>His last comment had been too much.  "It would be worth it."
What could I say to that?</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>He turned bright red.</p>
<p>"You're laughing at me!"</p>
<p>He stood up and glared down.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not," I said, "I'm laughing at me.  I shouldn't have been
bothered by what you said, but I was.  That tells me something funny
about me."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I'm getting sentimental in my old age, and that's funny."</p>
<p>"Oh."  He turned his back on me and walked over to the window and
stared out.  Then he jammed his hands into his pockets and turned
around and looked at me.</p>
<p>"Aren't you happy?" he asked.  "Really, I mean?  You've got money,
and no strings on you.  You could pick up and leave on the next I-V
that passes, if you wanted to."</p>
<p>"Sure I'm happy," I told him.  "My coffee was cold.  Forget it."</p>
<p>"Oh," again.  He turned back to the window in time to catch a
bright flash full in the face, and to have to compete with thunder to
get his next words out.  "I'm sorry," I heard him say, as in the
distance.  "It just seems to me that you should be one of the happiest
guys around..."</p>
<p>"I am.  It's the weather today.  It's got everybody down in the
mouth, yourself included."</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're right," he said.  "Look at it rain, will you?
Haven't seen any rain in months..."</p>
<p>"They've been saving it all up for today."</p>
<p>He chuckled.</p>
<p>"I'm going down for a cup of coffee and a sandwich before I sign
in.  Can I bring you anything?"</p>
<p>"No, thanks."</p>
<p>"Okay.  See you in a little while."</p>
<p>He walked out whistling.  He never stays depressed.  Like a kid's
moods, his moods, up and down, up and down...And he's a Hell Cop.
Probably the worst possible job for him, having to keep up his
attention in one place for so long.  They say the job title comes from
the name of an antique flying vehicle--a hellcopper, I think.  We send
our eyes on their appointed rounds, and they can hover or soar or back
up, just like those old machines could.  We patrol the city and the
adjacent countryside.  Law enforcement isn't much of a problem on Cyg.
We never peek in windows or send an eye into a building without an
invitation.  Our testimony is admissible in court--or, if we're fast
enough to press a couple buttons, the tape that we make does an even
better job--and we can dispatch live or robot cops in a hurry,
depending on which will do a better job.</p>
<p>There isn't much crime on Cyg, though, despite the fact that
everybody carries a sidearm of some kind, even little kids.  Everybody
knows pretty much what their neighbors are up to, and there aren't too
many places for a fugitive to run.  We're mainly aerial traffic cops,
with an eye out for local wildlife (which is the reason for all the
sidearms).</p>
<p>S.P.C.H. is what we call the latter function--Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Us--Which is the reason each of my
hundred-thirty eyes has six forty-five caliber eyelashes.</p>
<p>There are things like the cute little panda-puppy--oh, about three
feet high at the shoulder when it sits down on its rear like a teddy
bear, and with big, square, silky ears, a curly pinto coat, large,
limpid, brown eyes, pink tongue, button nose, powder puff tail, sharp
little white teeth more poisonous than a Quemeda Island viper's, and
possessed of a way with mammal entrails like unto the way of an
imaginative cat with a rope of catnip.</p>
<p>Then there's a _snapper_, which _looks_ as mean as it sounds: a
feathered reptile, with three horns on its armored head--one beneath
each eye, like a tusk, and one curving skyward from the top of its
nose--legs about eighteen inches long, and a four-foot tail which it
raises straight into the air whenever it jogs along at greyhound
speed, and which it swings like a sandbag--and a mouth full of long,
sharp teeth.</p>
<p>Also, there are amphibious things which come from the ocean by way
of the river on occasion.  I'd rather not speak of them.  They're kind
of ugly and vicious.</p>
<p>Anyway, those are some of the reasons why there are Hell Cops--not
just on Cyg, but on many, many frontier worlds.  I've been employed in
that capacity on several of them, and I've found that an experienced
H.C. can always find a job Out Here.  It's like being a professional
clerk back home.</p>
<p>Chuck took longer than I thought he would, came back after I was
technically off duty, looked happy though, so I didn't say anything.
There was some pale lipstick on his collar and a grin on his face, so
I bade him good morrow, picked up my cane, and departed in the
direction of the big washing machine.</p>
<p>It was coming down too hard for me to go the two blocks to my car
on foot.</p>
<p>I called a cab and waited another fifteen minutes.  Eleanor had
decided to keep Mayor's Hours, and she'd departed shortly after lunch;
and almost the entire staff had been released an hour early because of
the weather.  Consequently, Town Hall was full of dark offices and
echoes.  I waited in the hallway behind the main door, listening to
the purr of the rain as it fell, and hearing its gurgle as it found
its way into the gutters.  It beat the street and shook the
windowpanes and made the windows cold to touch.</p>
<p>I'd planned on spending the evening at the library, but I changed
my plans as I watched the weather happen.  --Tomorrow, or the next day,
I decided.  It was an evening for a good meal, a hot bath, my own
books and brandy, and early to bed.  It was good sleeping weather, if
nothing else.  A cab pulled up in front of the Hall and blew its horn.</p>
<p>I ran.</p>
<p>The next day the rain let up for perhaps an hour in the morning.  Then
a slow drizzle began; and it did not stop again.</p>
<p>It went on to become a steady downpour by afternoon.</p>
<p>The following day was Friday, which I always have off, and I was
glad that it was.</p>
<p>Put dittoes under Thursday's weather report.  That's Friday.</p>
<p>But I decided to do something anyway.</p>
<p>I lived down in that section of town near the river.  The Noble
was swollen, and the rains kept adding to it.  Sewers had begun to
clog and back up; water ran into the streets.  The rain kept coming
down and widening the puddles and lakelets, and it was accompanied by
drum solos in the sky and the falling of bright forks and sawblades.
Dead skytoads were washed along the gutters, like burnt-out fireworks.
Ball lightning drifted across Town Square; Saint Elmo's fire clung to
the flag pole, the Watch Tower, and the big statue of Wyeth trying to
look heroic.</p>
<p>I headed uptown to the library, pushing my car slowly through the
countless beaded curtains.  The big furniture movers in the sky were
obviously non-union, because they weren't taking any coffee breaks.
Finally, I found a parking place and I umbrellaed my way to the
library and entered.</p>
<p>I have become something of a bibliophile in recent years.  It is
not so much that I hunger and thirst after knowledge, but that I am
news-starved.</p>
<p>It all goes back to my position in the big mixmaster.  Admitted,
there are _some_ things faster than light, like the phase velocities
of radio waves in ion plasma, or the tips of the ion-modulated
light-beams of Duckbill, the comm-setup back in Sol System, whenever
the hinges of the beak snap shut on Earth--but these are highly
restricted instances, with no application whatsoever to the passage
of shiploads of people and objects between the stars.  You can't
exceed lightspeed when it comes to the movement of matter.  You can
edge up pretty close, but that's about it.</p>
<p>Life can be suspended though, that's easy--it can be switched off
and switched back on again with no trouble at all.  This is why _I_
have lasted so long.  If we can't speed up the ships, we _can_ slow
down the people--slow them until they stop--and _let_ the vessel, moving
at near-lightspeed, take half a century, or more if it needs it, to
convey its passengers to where they are going.  This is why I am very
alone.  Each little death means resurrection into both another land
and another time.  I have had several, and _this_ is why I have become
a bibliophile: news travels slowly, as slowly as the ships and the
people.  Buy a newspaper before you hop aboard a ship and it will
still be a newspaper when you reach your destination--but back where
you bought it, it would be considered an historical document.  Send a
letter back to Earth and your correspondent's grandson may be able to
get an answer back to your great-grandson, if the message makes real
good connections and both kids live long enough.</p>
<p>All the little libraries Out Here are full of rare books--first
editions of best sellers which people pick up before they leave
Someplace Else, and which they often donate after they've finished.
We assume that these books have entered the public domain by the time
they reach here, and we reproduce them and circulate our own editions.
No author has ever sued, and no reproducer has ever been around to
_be_ sued by representatives, designates, or assigns.</p>
<p>We are completely autonomous and are always behind the times,
because there is a transit-lag which cannot be overcome.  Earth
Central, therefore, exercises about as much control over us as a boy
jiggling a broken string while looking up at his kite.</p>
<p>Perhaps Yeats had something like this in mind when he wrote that
fine line, "Things fall apart; the center cannot hold."  I doubt it,
but I still have to go to the library to read the news.</p>
<p>The day melted around me.</p>
<p>The words flowed across the screen in my booth as I read
newspapers and magazines, untouched by human hands, and the waters
flowed across Betty's acres, pouring down from the mountains now,
washing the floors of the forest, churning our fields to
peanut-butter, flooding basements, soaking its way through everything,
and tracking our streets with mud.</p>
<p>I hit the library cafeteria for lunch, where I learned from a girl
in a green apron and yellow skirts (which swished pleasantly) that the
sandbag crews were now hard at work and that there was no eastbound
traffic past Town Square.</p>
<p>After lunch I put on my slicker and boots and walked up that way.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the sandbag wall was already waist high across Main
Street; but then, the water _was_ swirling around at ankle level, and
more of it falling every minute.</p>
<p>I looked up at old Wyeth's statue.  His halo had gone away now,
which was sort of to be expected.  It had made an honest mistake and
realized it after a short time.</p>
<p>He was holding a pair of glasses in his left hand and sort of
glancing down at me, as though a bit apprehensive, wondering perhaps,
there inside all that bronze, if I would tell on him now and ruin his
hard, wet, greenish splendor.  Tell...?  I guess I was the only one
around who really remembered the man.  He had wanted to be the father
of this great new country, literally, and he'd tried awfully hard.
Three months in office and I'd had to fill out the rest of the
two-year term.  The death certificate gave the cause as "heart
stoppage", but it didn't mention the piece of lead which had helped
slow things down a bit.  Everybody involved is gone now: the irate
husband, the frightened wife, the coroner.  All but me.  And I won't
tell anybody if Wyeth's statue won't, because he's a hero now, and we
need heroes' statues Out Here even more than we do heroes.  He _did_
engineer a nice piece of relief work during the Butler Township
floods, and he may as well be remembered for that.</p>
<p>I winked at my old boss, and the rain dripped from his nose and
fell into the puddle at my feet.</p>
<p>I walked back to the library through loud sounds and bright
flashes, hearing the splashing and the curses of the work crew as the
men began to block off another street.  Black, overhead, an eye
drifted past.  I waved, and the filter snapped up and back down again.
I think H.C. John Keams was tending shop that afternoon, but I'm not
sure.</p>
<p>Suddenly the heavens opened up and it was like standing under a
waterfall.</p>
<p>I reached for a wall and there wasn't one, slipped then, and
managed to catch myself with my cane before I flopped.  I found a
doorway and huddled.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of lightning and thunder followed.  Then, after the
blindness and the deafness passed away and the rains had eased a bit,
I saw that the street (Second Avenue) had become a river.  Bearing all
sorts of garbage, papers, hats, sticks, mud, it sloshed past my niche,
gurgling nastily.  It looked to be over my boot tops, so I waited for
it to subside.</p>
<p>It didn't.</p>
<p>It got right up in there with me and started to play footsie.</p>
<p>So, then seemed as good a time as any.  Things certainly weren't
getting any better.</p>
<p>I tried to run, but with filled boots the best you can manage is a
fast wade, and my boots were filled after three steps.</p>
<p>That shot the afternoon.  How can you concentrate on anything with
wet feet?  I made it back to the parking lot, then churned my way
homeward, feeling like a riverboat captain who really wanted to be a
camel driver.</p>
<p>It seemed more like evening that afternoon when I pulled up into
my damp but unflooded garage.  It seemed more like night than evening
in the alley I cut through on the way to my apartment's back entrance.
I hadn't seen the sun for several days, and it's funny how much you
can miss it when it takes a vacation.  The sky was a stable dome, and
the high brick walls of the alley were cleaner than I'd ever seen
them, despite the shadows.</p>
<p>I stayed close to the lefthand wall, in order to miss some of the
rain.  As I had driven along the river I'd noticed that it was already
reaching after the high water marks on the sides of the piers.  The
Noble was a big, spoiled, blood sausage, ready to burst its skin.  A
lightning flash showed me the whole alley, and I slowed in order to
avoid puddles.</p>
<p>I moved ahead, thinking of dry socks and dry martinis, turned a
corner to the right, and it struck at me: an org.</p>
<p>Half of its segmented body was reared at a forty-five degree angle
above the pavement, which placed its wide head with the traffic-signal
eyes saying "Stop", about three and a half feet off the ground, as it
rolled toward me on all its pale little legs, with its mouthful of
death aimed at my middle.</p>
<p>I pause now in my narrative for a long digression concerning my
childhood, which, if you will but consider the circumstances, I was
obviously fresh on it an instant:</p>
<p>Born, raised, educated on Earth, I had worked two summers in a
stockyard while going to college.  I still remember the smells and the
noises of the cattle; I used to prod them out of the pens and on their
way up the last mile.  And I remember the smells and noises of the
university: the formaldehyde in the Bio labs, the sounds of Freshmen
slaughtering French verbs, the overpowering aroma of coffee mixed with
cigarette smoke in the Student Union, the splash of the newly-pinned
frat man as his brothers tossed him into the lagoon down in front of
the Art Museum, the sounds of ignored chapel bells and class bells,
the smell of the lawn after the year's first mowing (with big, black
Andy perched on his grass-chewing monster, baseball cap down to his
eyebrows, cigarette somehow not burning his left cheek), and always,
always, the _tick-tick-snick-stamp!_ as I moved up or down the strip.
I had not wanted to take General Physical Education, but four
semesters of it were required.  The only out was to take a class in a
special sport.  I picked fencing because tennis, basketball, boxing,
wrestling, handball, judo, all sounded too strenuous, and I couldn't
afford a set of golf clubs.  Little did I suspect what would follow
this choice.  It was as strenuous as any of the others, and more than
several.  But I liked it.  So I tried out for the team in my Sophomore
year, made it on the epee squad, and picked up three varsity letters,
because I stuck with it through my Senior year.  Which all goes to
show: Cattle who persevere in looking for an easy out still wind up in
the abattoir, but they may enjoy the trip a little more.</p>
<p>When I came out here on the raw frontier where people all carry
weapons, I had my cane made.  It combines the best features of the
epee and the cattle prod.  Only, it is the kind of prod which, if you
were to prod cattle with it, they would never move again.</p>
<p>Over eight hundred volts, max, when the tip touches, if the stud
in the handle is depressed properly...</p>
<p>My arm shot out and up and my fingers depressed the stud properly
as it moved.</p>
<p>That was it for the org.</p>
<p>A noise came from beneath the rows of razor blades in its mouth as
I scored a touch on its soft underbelly and whipped my arm away to the
side--a noise halfway between an exhalation and "peep"--and that was it
for the org (short for
"organism-with-a-long-name-which-I-can't-remember").</p>
<p>I switched off my cane and walked around it.  It was one of those
things which sometimes come out of the river.  I remember that I
looked back at it three times, then I switched the cane on again at
max and kept it that way till I was inside my apartment with the door
locked behind me and all the lights burning.</p>
<p>Then I permitted myself to tremble, and after awhile I changed my
socks and mixed my drink.</p>
<p>May your alleys be safe from orgs.</p>
<p>Saturday.</p>
<p>More rain.</p>
<p>Wetness was all.</p>
<p>The entire east side had been shored with sand bags.  In some
places they served only to create sandy waterfalls, where otherwise
the streams would have flowed more evenly and perhaps a trifle more
clearly.  In other places they held it all back, for awhile.</p>
<p>By then, there were six deaths as a direct result of the rains.</p>
<p>By then, there had been fires caused by the lightning, accidents
by the water, sicknesses by the dampness, the cold.</p>
<p>By then, property damages were beginning to mount pretty high.</p>
<p>Everyone was tired and angry and miserable and wet, by then.  This
included me.</p>
<p>Though Saturday was Saturday, I went to work.  I worked in
Eleanor's office, with her.  We had the big relief map spread on a
table, and six mobile eyescreens were lined against one wall.  Six
eyes hovered above the half-dozen emergency points and kept us abreast
of the actions taken upon them.  Several new telephones and a big
radio set stood on the desk.  Five ashtrays looked as if they wanted
to be empty, and the coffee pot chuckled cynically at human activity.</p>
<p>The Noble had almost reached its high water mark.  We were not an
isolated storm center by any means.  Upriver, Butler Township was
hurting, Swan's Nest was adrip, Laurie was weeping the river, and the
wilderness in between was shaking and streaming.</p>
<p>Even though we were in direct contact we went into the field on
three occasions that morning--once, when the north-south bridge over
the Lance River collapsed and was washed down toward the Noble as far
as the bend by the Mack steel mill; again, when the Wildwood Cemetery,
set up on a storm-gouged hill to the east, was plowed deeply, graves
opened, and several coffins set awash; and finally, when three houses
full of people toppled, far to the east.  Eleanor's small flyer was
buffeted by the winds as we fought our way through to these sites for
on-the-spot supervision; I navigated almost completely by instruments.
Downtown proper was accommodating evacuees left and right by then.  I
took three showers that morning and changed clothes twice.</p>
<p>Things slowed down a bit in the afternoon, including the rain.
The cloud cover didn't break, but a drizzle-point was reached which
permitted us to gain a little on the waters.  Retaining walls were
reinforced, evacuees were fed and dried, some of the rubbish was
cleaned up.  Four of the six eyes were returned to their patrols,
because four of the emergency points were no longer emergency points.</p>
<p>...And we wanted all of the eyes for the org patrol.</p>
<p>Inhabitants of the drenched forest were also on the move.  Seven
_snappers_ and a horde of panda-puppies were shot that day, as well as
a few crawly things from the troubled waters of the Noble--not to
mention assorted branch-snakes, stingbats, borers, and land-eels.</p>
<p>By 1900 hours it seemed that a stalemate had been achieved.
Eleanor and I climbed into her flyer and drifted skyward.</p>
<p>We kept rising.  Finally, there was a hiss as the cabin began to
pressurize itself.  The night was all around us.  Eleanor's face, in
the light from the instrument panel, was a mask of weariness.  She
raised her hands to her temples as if to remove it, and then when I
looked back again it appeared that she had.  A faint smile lay across
her lips now and her eyes sparkled.  A stray strand of hair shadowed
her brow.</p>
<p>"Where are you taking me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Up, high," said I, "above the storm."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"It's been many days," I said, "since we have seen an uncluttered
sky."</p>
<p>"True," she agreed, and as she leaned forward to light a cigarette
I noticed that the part in her hair had gone all askew.  I wanted to
reach out and straighten it for her, but I didn't.</p>
<p>We plunged into the sea of clouds.</p>
<p>Dark was the sky, moonless.  The stars shone like broken diamonds.
The clouds were a floor of lava.</p>
<p>We drifted.  We stared up into the heavens.  I "anchored" the
flyer, like an eye set to hover, and lit a cigarette myself.</p>
<p>"You are older than I am," she finally said, "really.  You know?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"There is a certain wisdom, a certain strength, something like the
essence of the time that passes--that seeps into a man as he sleeps
between the stars.  I know, because I can feel it when I'm around
you."</p>
<p>"No," I said.</p>
<p>"Then maybe it's people expecting you to have the strength of
centuries that gives you something like it.  It was probably there to
begin with."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>She chuckled.</p>
<p>"It isn't exactly a positive sort of thing either."</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>"You asked me if I was going to run for office again this fall.
The answer is 'no'.  I'm planning on retiring.  I want to settle
down."</p>
<p>"With anyone special?"</p>
<p>"Yes, very special, Juss," she said, and she smiled at me and I
kissed her, but not for too long, because the ash was about to fall
off her cigarette and down the back of my neck.</p>
<p>So we put both cigarettes out and drifted above the invisible
city, beneath a sky without a moon.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that I would tell you about Stopovers.  If you are
going a distance of a hundred forty-five light years and are taking
maybe a hundred-fifty actual years to do it, why stop and stretch your
legs?</p>
<p>Well, first of all and mainly, almost nobody sleeps out the whole
jaunt.  There are lots of little gadgets which require human
monitoring at all times.  No one is going to sit there for a
hundred-fifty years and watch them, all by himself.  So everyone takes
a turn or two, passengers included.  They are all briefed on what to
do til the doctor comes, and who to awaken and how to go about it,
should troubles crop up.  Then everyone takes a turn at guard mount
for a month or so, along with a few companions.  There are always
hundreds of people aboard, and after you've worked down through the
role you take it again from the top.  All sorts of mechanical agents
are backing them up, many of which they are unaware of (to protect
_against_ them, as well as _with_ them--in the improbable instance of
several oddballs getting together and deciding to open a window,
change course, murder passengers, or things like that), and the people
are well-screened and carefully matched up, so as to check and balance
each other as well as the machinery.  All of this because gadgets and
people both bear watching.</p>
<p>After several turns at ship's guard, interspersed with periods of
cold sleep, you tend to grow claustrophobic and somewhat depressed.
Hence, when there is an available Stopover, it is utilized, to restore
mental equilibrium and to rearouse flagging animal spirits.  This also
serves the purpose of enriching the life and economy of the Stopover
world, by whatever information and activities you may have in you.</p>
<p>Stopover, therefore, has become a traditional holiday on many
worlds, characterized by festivals and celebrations on some of the
smaller ones, and often by parades and world-wide broadcast interviews
and press conferences on those with greater populations.  I understand
that it is now pretty much the same on Earth, too, whenever colonial
visitors stop by.  In fact, one fairly unsuccessful young starlet,
Marilyn Austin, made a long voyage Out, stayed a few months, and
returned on the next vessel headed back.  After appearing on tri-dee a
couple times, sounding off about interstellar culture, and flashing
her white, white teeth, she picked up a flush contract, a third
husband, and her first big part in tapes.  All of which goes to show
the value of Stopovers.</p>
<p>I landed us atop Helix, Betty's largest apartment-complex, wherein
Eleanor had her double-balconied corner suite, affording views both of
the distant Noble and of the lights of Posh Valley, Betty's
residential section.</p>
<p>Eleanor prepared steaks, with baked potato, cooked corn,
beer--everything I liked.  I was happy and sated and such, and I stayed
till around midnight, making plans for our future.  Then I took a cab
back to Town Square, where I was parked.</p>
<p>When I arrived, I thought I'd check with the Trouble Center just
to see how things were going.  So I entered the Hall, stamped my feet,
brushed off excess waters, hung my coat, and proceeded up the empty
hallway to the elevator.</p>
<p>The elevator was too quiet.  They're supposed to rattle, you know?
They shouldn't sigh softly and have doors that open and close without
a sound.  So I walked around an embarrassing corner on my way to the
Trouble Center.</p>
<p>It was a pose Rodin might have enjoyed working with.  All I can
say is that it's a good thing I stopped by when I did, rather than
five or ten minutes later.</p>
<p>Chuck Fuller and Lottie, Eleanor's secretary, were practicing
mouth to mouth resuscitating and keeping the victim alive techniques,
there on the couch in the little alcove off to the side of the big
door to T.C.</p>
<p>Chuck's back was to me, but Lottie spotted me over his shoulder,
and her eyes widened and she pushed him away.  He turned his head
quickly.</p>
<p>"Juss..." he said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Just passing by," I told him.  "Thought I'd stop in to say hello
and take a look at the eyes."</p>
<p>"Uh--everything's going real well," he said, stepping back into the
hallway.  "It's on auto right now, and I'm on my--uh, coffee break.
Lottie is on night duty, and she came by to--see if we had any reports
we needed typed. She had a dizzy spell, so we came out here where the
couch..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, she looks a little--peaked," I said.  "There are smelling
salts and aspirins in the medicine chest."</p>
<p>I walked on by into the Center, feeling awkward.</p>
<p>Chuck followed me after a couple of minutes.  I was watching the
screens when he came up beside me.  Things appeared to be somewhat in
hand, though the rains were still moistening the one hundred thirty
views of Betty.</p>
<p>"Uh, Juss," he said, "I didn't know you were coming by..."</p>
<p>"Obviously."</p>
<p>"What I'm getting at is--you won't report me, will you?"</p>
<p>"No, I won't report you."</p>
<p>"...And you wouldn't mention it to Cynthia, would you?"</p>
<p>"Your extracurricular activities," I said, "are your own business.
As a friend, I suggest you do them on your own time and in a more
propitious location.  But it's already beginning to slip my mind.  I'm
sure I'll forget the whole thing in another minute."</p>
<p>"Thanks Juss," he said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"What's Weather Central have to say these days?" I asked, raising
the phone.</p>
<p>He shook his head, so I dialed listened.</p>
<p>"Bad," I said, hanging up.  "More wet to come."</p>
<p>"Damn," he announced and lit a cigarette, his hands shaking.
"This weather's getting me down."</p>
<p>"Me too," said I.  "I'm going to run now, because I want to get
home before it starts in bad again.  I'll probably be around tomorrow.
See you."</p>
<p>"Night."</p>
<p>I elevated back down, fetched my coat, and left.  I didn't see
Lottie anywhere about, but she probably was, waiting for me to go.</p>
<p>I got to my car and was halfway home before the faucets came on
full again.  The sky was torn open with lightnings, and a sizzlecloud
stalked the city like a long-legged arachnid, forking down bright
limbs and leaving tracks of fire where it went.  I made it home in
another fifteen minutes, and the phenomenon was still in progress as I
entered the garage.  As I walked up the alley (cane switched on) I
could hear the distant sizzle and the rumble, and a steady half-light
filling the spaces between the buildings, from its
_flash-burn-flash-burn_striding.</p>
<p>Inside, I listened to the thunder and the rain, and I watched the
apocalypse off in the distance.</p>
<p>Delirium of city under storm--</p>
<p>The buildings across the way were quite clear in the pulsing light
of the thing.  The lamps were turned off in my apartment so that I
could better appreciate the vision.  All of the shadows seemed
incredibly black and inky, lying right beside glowing stairways,
pediments, windowsills, balconies; and all of that which was
illuminated seemed to burn as though with an internal light.
Overhead, the living/not living insect-thing of fire stalked, and an
eye wearing a blue halo was moving across the tops of nearby
buildings.  The fires pulsed and the clouds burnt like the hills of
Gehenna; the thunders burbled and banged; and the white rain drilled
into the roadway which had erupted into a steaming lather.  Then a
_snapper_, tri-horned, wet-feathered, demon-faced, sword-tailed, and
green, raced from around a corner, a moment after I'd heard a sound
which I had thought to be a part of the thunder.  The creature ran, at
an incredible speed, along the smoky pavement.  The eye swooped after
it, adding a hail of lead to the falling raindrops.  Both vanished up
another street.  It had taken but an instant, but in that instant it
had resolved a question in my mind as to who should do the painting.
Not El Greco, not Blake; no: Bosch.  Without any question, Bosch--with
his nightmare visions of the streets of Hell.  He would be the one to
do justice to this moment of the storm.</p>
<p>I watched until the sizzlecloud drew its legs up into itself, hung
like a burning cocoon, then died like an ember retreating into ash.
Suddenly, it was very dark and there was only the rain.</p>
<p>Sunday was the day of chaos.</p>
<p>Candles burned, churches burned, people drowned, beasts ran wild
in the streets (or swam there), houses were torn up by the roots and
bounced like paper boats along the waterways, the great wind came down
upon us, and after that the madness.</p>
<p>I was not able to drive to Town Hall, so Eleanor sent her flyer
after me.</p>
<p>The basement was filled with water, and the ground floor was like
Neptune's waiting room.  All previous high water marks had been
passed.</p>
<p>We were in the middle of the worst storm in Betty's history.</p>
<p>Operations had been transferred up onto the third floor.  There
was no way to stop things now.  It was just a matter of riding it out
and giving what relief we could.  I sat before my gallery and watched.</p>
<p>It rained buckets, it rained vats; it rained swimming pools and
lakes and rivers.  For awhile it seemed that it rained oceans upon us.
This was partly because of the wind which came in from the gulf and
suddenly made it seem to rain sideways with the force of its blasts.
It began at about noon and was gone in a few hours, but when it left
our town was broken and bleeding.  Wyeth lay on his bronze side, the
flagpole was gone, there was no building without broken windows and
water inside, we were suddenly suffering lapses of electrical power,
and one of my eyes showed three panda-puppies devouring a dead child.
Cursing, I killed them across the rain and the distance.  Eleanor wept
at my side.  There was a report later of a pregnant woman who could
only deliver by Caesarean section, trapped on a hilltop with her
family, and in labor.  We were still trying to get through to her with
a flyer, but the winds...I saw burnt buildings and the corpses of
people and animals.  I saw half-buried cars and splintered homes.  I
saw waterfalls where there had been no waterfalls before.  I fired
many rounds that day, and not just at beasts from the forest.  Sixteen
of my eyes had been shot out by looters.  I hope that I never again
see some of the films I made that day.</p>
<p>When the worst Sunday night in my life began, and the rains did
not cease, I knew the meaning of despair for the third time in my
life.</p>
<p>Eleanor and I were in the Trouble Center.  The lights had just
gone out for the eighth time.  The rest of the staff was down on the
third floor.  We sat there in the dark without moving, without being
able to do a single thing to halt the course of chaos.  We couldn't
even watch it until the power came back on.</p>
<p>So we talked.</p>
<p>Whether it was for five minutes or an hour, I don't really know.
I remember telling her, though, about the girl buried on another
world, whose death had set me to running.  Two trips to two worlds and
I had broken my bond with the times.  But a hundred years of travel do
not bring a century of forgetfulness--not when you cheat time with the
_petite mort_ of the cold sleep.  Time's vengeance is memory, and
though for an age you plunder the eye of seeing and empty the ear of
sound, when you awaken your past is still with you.   The worst thing
to do then is to return to visit your wife's nameless grave in a
changed land, to come back as a stranger to the place you had made
your home.  You run again then, and after a time you _do_ forget,
some, because a certain amount of actual time must pass for you also.
But by then you are alone, all by yourself: completely alone.  That
was the _first_ time in my life that I knew the meaning of despair.  I
read, I worked, I drank, I whored, but came the morning after and I
was always me, by myself.  I jumped from world to world, hoping things
would be different, but with each change I was further away from all
the things I had known.</p>
<p>Then another feeling gradually came upon me, and a really terrible
feeling it was: There _must_ be a time and a place best suited for
each person who has ever lived.  After the worst of my grief had left
me and I had come to terms with the vanished past, I wondered about a
man's place in time and space.  Where, and _when_ in the cosmos would
I most like to live out the balance of my days?  --To live at my
fullest potential?  The past _was_ dead, but perhaps a better time
waited on some as yet undiscovered world, waited at one yet-to-be
recorded moment in its history.  How could I _ever_ know?  How could I
ever be sure that my Golden Age did not lay but one more world away,
and that I might be struggling in a Dark Era while the Renaissance of
my days was but a ticket, a visa and a diary-page removed?  That was
my _second_ despair.  I did know the answer until I came to the Land
of the Swan.  I do not know why I loved you Eleanor, but I did, and
that was my answer.  Then the rains came.</p>
<p>When the lights returned we sat there and smoked.  She had told me
of her husband, who had died a hero's death in time to save him from
the delirium tremors which would have ended his days.  Died as the
bravest die--not knowing why--because of a reflex, which after all had
been a part of him, a reflex which had made him cast himself into the
path of a pack of wolf-like creatures attacking the exploring party he
was with--off in that forest at the foot of Saint Stephen's--to fight
them with a machete and to be torn apart by them while his companions
fled to the camp, where they made a stand and saved themselves.  Such
is the essence of valor: an unthinking moment, a spark along the
spinal nerves, predetermined by the sum total of everything you have
ever done, wished to do or not to do, and wish you had done, or
hadn't, and then comes the pain.</p>
<p>We watched the gallery on the wall.  Man is the reasoning animal?
Greater than beasts but less than angels?  Not the murderer I shot
that night.  He wasn't even the one who uses tools or buries his dead.
--Laughs, aspires, affirms?  I didn't see any of those going on.
--Watches himself watch himself doing what he knows is absurd?  Too
sophisticated.  He just did the absurd without watching.  Like running
back into a burning house after his favorite pipe and a can of
tobacco.  --Devises religions?  I saw people praying, but they weren't
devising.  They were making last-ditch efforts at saving themselves,
after they'd exhausted everything else they knew to do.  Reflex.</p>
<p>The creature who loves?</p>
<p>That's the only one I might not be able to gainsay.</p>
<p>I saw a mother holding her daughter up on her shoulders while the
water swirled about her armpits, and the little girl was holding her
doll up above _her_ shoulders, in the same way.  But isn't that--the
love--a part of the total?  Of everything you have ever done, or
wished?  Positive or neg?  I know that it is what made me leave my
post, running, and what made me climb into Eleanor's flyer and what
made me fight my way through the storm and out to that particular
scene.</p>
<p>I didn't get there in time.</p>
<p>I shall never forget how glad I was that someone else did.  Johnny
Keams blinked his lights above me as he rose, and he radioed down:</p>
<p>"It's all right.  They're okay.  Even the doll."</p>
<p>"Good," I said, and headed back.</p>
<p>As I set the ship down on its balcony landing, one figure came
toward me.  As I stepped down, a gun appeared in Chuck's hand.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't kill you, Juss," he began, "but I'd wound you.  Face
the wall.  I'm taking the flyer."</p>
<p>"Are you crazy?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"I know what I'm doing.  I need it, Juss."</p>
<p>"Well, if you need it, there it is.  You don't have to point a gun
at me.  I just got through needing it myself.  Take it."</p>
<p>"Lottie and I both need it," he said.  "Turn around!"</p>
<p>I turned toward the wall.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>
<p>"We're going away, together--now!"</p>
<p>"You _are_ crazy," I said.  "This is no time..."</p>
<p>"C'mon, Lottie," he called, and there was a rush of feet behind me
and I heard the flyer's door open.</p>
<p>"Chuck!" I said.  "We need you now!  You can settle this thing
peacefully, in a week, in a month, after some order has been restored.
There _are_ such things as divorces, you know."</p>
<p>"That won't get me off this world, Juss."</p>
<p>"So how is _this_ going to help?"</p>
<p>I turned, and I saw that he had picked up a large canvas bag from
somewhere and had it slung over his left shoulder, like Santa Claus.</p>
<p>"Turn back around!  I don't want to shoot you," he warned.</p>
<p>The suspicion came, grew stronger.</p>
<p>"Chuck, have you been looting?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Turn around!"</p>
<p>"All right, I'll turn around.  How far do you think you'll get?"</p>
<p>"Far enough," he said.  "Far enough so that no one will find
us--and when the time comes, we'll leave this world."</p>
<p>"No," I said.  "I don't think you will, because I know you."</p>
<p>"We'll see."  His voice was further away then.</p>
<p>I heard three rapid footsteps and the slamming of a door.  I
turned then, in time to see the flyer rising from the balcony.</p>
<p>I watched it go.  I never saw either of them again.</p>
<p>Inside, two men were unconscious on the floor.  It turned out that
they were not seriously hurt.  After I saw them cared for, I rejoined
Eleanor in the Tower.</p>
<p>All that night did we wait, emptied, for morning.</p>
<p>Somehow, it came.</p>
<p>We sat and watched the light flow through the rain.  So much had
happened so quickly.  So many things had occurred during the past week
that we were unprepared for morning.</p>
<p>It brought an end to the rains.</p>
<p>A good wind came from out of the north and fought with the clouds,
like En-ki with the serpent Tiamat.  Suddenly, there was a canyon of
cobalt.</p>
<p>A cloudquake shook the heavens and chasms of light opened across
its dark landscape.</p>
<p>It was coming apart as we watched.</p>
<p>I heard a cheer, and I croaked in unison with it as the sun
appeared.</p>
<p>The good, warm, drying, beneficial sun drew the highest peak of
Saint Stephen's to its face and kissed both its cheeks.</p>
<p>There was a crowd before each window.  I joined one and stared,
perhaps for ten minutes.</p>
<p>When you awaken from a nightmare you do not normally find its ruins
lying about your bedroom.  This is one way of telling whether or not
something was only a bad dream, or whether or not you are really
awake.</p>
<p>We walked the streets in great boots.  Mud was everywhere.  It was
in basements and in machinery and in sewers and in living room clothes
closets.  It was on buildings and on cars and on people and on the
branches of trees.  It was broken brown blisters drying and waiting to
be peeled off from clean tissue.  Swarms of skytoads rose into the air
when we approached, hovered like dragon-flies, returned to spoiling
food stores after we had passed.  Insects were having a heyday, too.
Betty would have to be deloused.  So many things were overturned or
fallen down, and half-buried in the brown Sargassos of the streets.
The dead had not yet been numbered.  The water still ran by, but
sluggish and foul.  A stench was beginning to rise across the city.
There were smashed-in store fronts and there was glass everywhere, and
bridges fallen down and holes in the streets...But why go on?  If you
don't get the picture by now, you never will.  It was the big morning
after, following a drunken party by the gods.  It is the lot of mortal
man always to clean up their leavings or be buried beneath them.</p>
<p>So clean we did, but by noon Eleanor could no longer stand.  So I
took her home with me, because we were working down near the harbor
section and my place was nearer.</p>
<p>That's almost the whole story--light to darkness to light--except
for the end, which I don't really know.  I'll tell you of its
beginning, though...</p>
<p>I dropped her off at the head of the alleyway, and she went on toward
my apartment while I parked the car.  Why didn't I keep her with me?
I don't know.  Unless it was because the morning sun made the world
seem at peace, despite its filth.  Unless it was because I was in love
and the darkness was over, and the spirit of the night had surely
departed.</p>
<p>I parked the car and started up the alley.  I was halfway before
the corner where I had met the org when I heard her cry out.</p>
<p>I ran.  Fear gave me speed and strength and I ran to the corner
and turned it.</p>
<p>The man had a bag, not unlike the one Chuck had carried away with
him, lying beside the puddle in which he stood.  He was going through
Eleanor's purse, and she lay on the ground--so still!--with blood on the
side of her head.</p>
<p>I cursed and ran toward him, switching on my cane as I went.  He
turned, dropped her purse, and reached for the gun in his belt.</p>
<p>We were about thirty feet apart, so I threw my cane.</p>
<p>He drew his gun, pointed it at me, and my cane fell into the
puddle in which he stood.</p>
<p>Flights of angels sang him to his rest, perhaps.</p>
<p>She was breathing, so I got her inside and got hold of a doctor--I
don't remember how, not too clearly, anyway--and I waited and waited.</p>
<p>She lived for another twelve hours and then she died.  She
recovered consciousness twice before they operated on her, and not
again after.  She didn't say anything.  She smiled at me once, and
went to sleep again.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Anything, really.</p>
<p>It happened that I became Betty's mayor, to fill in until
November, to oversee the rebuilding.  I worked, I worked my head off,
and I left her bright and shiny, as I had found her.  I think I could
have won if I had run for the job that fall, but I did not want it.</p>
<p>The Town Council overrode my objections and voted to erect a
statue of Godfrey Justin Holmes beside the statue of Eleanor Schirrer
which was to stand in the Square across from cleaned-up Wyeth.  I
guess it's out there now.</p>
<p>I said that I would never return, but who knows?  In a couple of
years, after some more history has passed, I may revisit a Betty full
of strangers, if only to place a wreath at the foot of the one statue.
Who knows but that the entire continent may be steaming and clanking
and whirring with automation by then, and filled with people from
shore to shining shore?</p>
<p>There was a Stopover at the end of the year and I waved goodbye
and climbed aboard and went away, anywhere.</p>
<p>I went aboard and went away, to sleep again the cold sleep.</p>
<p>Delirium of ship among stars--</p>
<p>Years have passed, I suppose.  I'm not really counting them
anymore.  But I think of this thing often: Perhaps there _is_ a Golden
Age someplace, a Renaissance for me sometime, a special time
somewhere, somewhere but a ticket, a visa, a diary-page away.  I don't
know where or when.  Who does?  Where are all the rains of yesterday?</p>
<p>In the invisible city?</p>
<p>Inside me?</p>
<p>It is cold and quiet outside and the horizon is infinity.  There
is no sense of movement.</p>
<p>There is no moon, and the stars are very bright, like broken
diamonds, all.</p>

</section><section><title><p>The Great Slow Kings</p></title>
<section>

<p>Drax and Dran sat in the great Throne Hall of  Glan,  discussing  life.
Monarchs  by  virtue  of  superior intellect and physique--and the fact that
they were the last two survivors of the race of Glan--theirs was  a  divided
rule over the planet and their one subject, Zindrome, the palace robot.</p>
<p>Drax had been musing for the past four centuries (theirs was a sluggish
sort) over the possibility of life on other planets in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Accordingly,  "Dran,"  said  he, addressing the other (who was becoming
mildly curious as to his thoughts), "Dran, I've been thinking. There may  be
life on other planets in the galaxy."</p>
<p>Dran  considered  his  response  to  this, as the world wheeled several
times about its sun.</p>
<p>"True," he finally agreed, "there may."</p>
<p>After several months Drax shot back, "If there is,  we  ought  to  find
out."</p>
<p>"Why?"  asked  Dran  with  equal  promptness, which caused the other to
suspect that he, too, had been thinking along these lines.</p>
<p>So he measured his next statement out cautiously,  first  testing  each
word within the plated retort of his reptilian skull.</p>
<p>"Our  kingdom  is  rather  underpopulated at present," he observed. "It
would be good to have many subjects once more."</p>
<p>Dran regarded him askance, then slowly turned his head. He  closed  one
eye  and  half-closed  the  other,  taking full stock of his co-ruler, whose
appearance, as he had suspected, was unchanged since the last  time  he  had
looked.</p>
<p>"That, also, is true," he noted. "What do you suggest we do?"</p>
<p>This time Drax turned, reappraising him, eye to eye.</p>
<p>I  think  we ought to find out if there is life on other planets in the
galaxy."</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>Two quick rounds of the seasons went unnoticed,  then,  "Let  me  think
about it," he said, and turned away.</p>
<p>After what he deemed a polite period of time, Drax coughed.</p>
<p>"Have you thought sufficiently?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Drax  struggled  to  focus  his  eyes  on the near-subliminal streak of
bluish light which traversed, re-traversed and re-re-traversed the  Hall  as
he waited.</p>
<p>"Zindrome!" he finally called out.</p><empty-line/><p>The   robot  slowed  his  movements  to  a  statue-like  immobility  to
accommodate his master. A feather duster protruded from his right limb.</p>
<p>"You called, great Lord of Glan?"</p>
<p>"Yes,  Zindrome,  worthy  subject.  Those  old  spaceships   which   we
constructed  in happier days, and never got around to using. Are any of them
still capable of operation?"</p>
<p>"I'll check, great Lord."</p>
<p>He seemed to change position slightly.</p>
<p>"There are three hundred eighty-two," he announced, "of which four  are
in  functioning  condition,  great  Lord.  I've  checked  all  the operating
circuits."</p>
<p>"Drax,"  warned  Dran,  "you  are  arrogating  unauthorized  powers  to
yourself  once  more.  You should have conferred with me before issuing that
order."</p>
<p>"I apologize," stated the other. "I simply wanted to expedite  matters,
should your decision be that we conduct a survey."</p>
<p>"You  have  anticipated  my decision correctly," nodded Dran, "but your
eagerness seems to bespeak a hidden purpose."</p>
<p>"No purpose but the good of the realm," smiled the other.</p>
<p>"That may be, but the last time you spoke of 'the good  of  the  realm'
the civil strife which ensued cost us our other robot."</p>
<p>"I  have  learned  my  lesson  and  profited  thereby.  I shall be more
judicious in the future."</p>
<p>"I hope so. Now, about this investigation--which part of the galaxy  do
you intend to investigate first?"</p>
<p>A tension-filled pause ensued.</p>
<p>"I had assumed," murmured Drax, "that you would conduct the expedition.
Being  the  more mature monarch, yours should be a more adequate decision as
to whether or not a particular species is worthy of our enlightened rule."</p>
<p>"Yes, but your youth tends to make you more active than I. The  journey
should  be  more  expeditiously  conducted  by  you." He emphasized the word
"expeditiously."</p>
<p>"We could both go, in separate ships," offered  Drax.  "That  would  be
truly expeditious--"</p>
<p>Their heated debating was cut short by a metallic cough-equivalent.</p>
<p>"Masters,"  suggested Zindrome, "the half-life of radioactive materials
being as ephemeral as it is, I regret to report that only one  spaceship  is
now in operational condition."</p>
<p>"That settles it, Dran. _You_ go. It will require a steadier _rrand_ to
manage an underpowered ship."</p>
<p>"And  leave  you  to foment civil strife and usurp unfranchised powers?
No, you go!"</p>
<p>"I suppose we could _both_ go," sighed Drax.</p>
<p>"Fine! Leave the kingdom leaderless! _That_ is the kind of muddleheaded
thinking which brought about our present political embarrassment."</p>
<p>"Masters," said Zindrome, "if _someone_ doesn't go soon the  ship  will
be useless."</p>
<p>They  both  studied  their  servant, approving the rapid chain of logic
forged by his simple statement.</p>
<p>"Very well," they smiled in unison, "_you_ go."</p>
<p>Zindrome bowed quite obsequiously and departed from  the  great  Throne
Hall of Glan.</p>
<p>"Perhaps  we  should  authorize  Zindrome  to  construct  facsimiles of
himself," stated Dran, tentatively.  "If  we  had  more  subjects  we  could
accomplish more."</p>
<p>"Are  you  forgetting  our  most  recent  agreement?"  asked  Drax.  "A
superfluity of  robots  tended  to  stimulate  factionalism  last  time--and
certain people grew ambitious..." He let his voice trail off over the years,
for emphasis.</p>
<p>"I  am  not  certain as to whether your last allusion contains a hidden
accusation," began the other carefully. "If so, permit  me  to  caution  you
concerning  rashness--and  to  remind  you  who  it  was  who engineered the
Mono-Robot Protection Pact."</p>
<p>"Do you believe things will be different in the case of a multitude  of
organic subjects?" inquired the other.</p>
<p>"Definitely,"  said Dran. "There is a certain irrational element in the
rationale of the organic being, making it less  amenable  to  direct  orders
than a machine would be. Our robots, at least, were faithful when we ordered
them  to  destroy  each  other.  Irresponsible organic subjects either do it
without being told, which is boorish, or refuse to  do  it  when  you  order
them, which is insubordination."</p>
<p>"True,"  smiled  Drax,  unearthing a gem he had preserved for millennia
against this occasion. "Concerning organic life the only statement which can
be made with certainty is that life is uncertain."</p>
<p>"Hmm." Dran narrowed his eyes to slits.  "Let  me  ponder  that  for  a
moment.  Like  much  of  your  thinking  it  seems  to  smack of a concealed
sophistry."</p>
<p>"It contains none, I assure you. It is the fruit of much meditation."</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p><empty-line/><p>Dran's pondering was cut short, by the arrival of Zindrome who clutched
two brownish blurs beneath his metal arms.</p>
<p>"Back already, Zindrome? What have you there? Slow them down so we  can
see them."</p>
<p>"They are under sedation at present, great Masters. It is the movements
caused  by their breathing which produce the unpleasant vibration pattern on
your retinas. To subject them to more narcosis could prove deleterious."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless," maintained Dran, "we must  appraise  our  new  subjects
carefully, which requires that we see them. Slow them down some more."</p>
<p>"You  gave  that  order without-" began Drax, but was distracted by the
sudden appearance of the two hairy bipeds.</p>
<p>"Warm-blooded?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, Lord."</p>
<p>"That bespeaks a very brief life-span."</p>
<p>"True," offered Dran, "but that kind tends to reproduce quite rapidly."</p>
<p>"That  observation  tends  to  be  correct,"  nodded  Drax.  "Tell  me,
Zindrome, do they represent the sexes necessary for reproduction?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Master. There are two sexes among these anthropoids, so I brought
one of each."</p>
<p>"That was very wise. Where did you find them?"</p>
<p>"Several billion light years from here."</p>
<p>"Turn those two loose outside and go fetch us some more."</p>
<p>The creatures vanished. Zindrome appeared not to have moved.</p>
<p>"Have you the fuel necessary for another such journey?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord. More of it has evolved recently."</p>
<p>"Excellent."</p>
<p>The robot departed.</p>
<p>"What sort of governmental setup should be inaugurate this time?" asked
Drax.</p>
<p>"Set us review the arguments for the various types."</p>
<p>"A good idea."</p><empty-line/><p>In the midst of their discussion Zindrome returned and stood waiting to
be recognized.</p>
<p>"What is it, Zindrome? Did you forget something?"</p>
<p>"No,  great  Lords.  When I returned to the world from which I obtained
the samples I discovered that the race had progressed to the point where  it
developed  fission  processes,  engaged  in  an  atomic  war and annihilated
itself."</p>
<p>"That was extremely inconsiderate--typical, however, I should  say,  of
warm-blooded instability."</p>
<p>Zindrome continued to shift.</p>
<p>"Have you something else to report?"</p>
<p>"Yes,  great  Masters. The two specimens I released have multiplied and
are now spread over the entire planet of Glan."</p>
<p>"We should have been advised!"</p>
<p>"Yes, great Lords, but I was absent and--"</p>
<p>"They themselves should have reported this action!"</p>
<p>"Masters, I am afraid they are unaware of your existence."</p>
<p>"How could that have happened?" asked Dran.</p>
<p>"We are presently buried beneath several thousand  layers  of  alluvial
rock. The geological shifts--"</p>
<p>"You  have  your  orders  to maintain the place and clean the grounds,"
glowered Dran. "Have you been frittering away your time again?"</p>
<p>"No, great Lords! It all occurred during my absence. I shall attend  to
it immediately."</p>
<p>"First," ordered Drax, "tell us what else our subjects have been up to,
that they saw fit to conceal from us."</p>
<p>"Recently,"  observed the robot, "they have discovered how to forge and
temper metals. Upon  landing,  I  observed  that  they  had  developed  many
ingenious  instruments  of  a cutting variety. Unfortunately they were using
them to cut one another."</p>
<p>"Do you mean," roared Dran, "that there is strife in the kingdom?"</p>
<p>"Uh, yes, my Lord."</p>
<p>"I will not brook unauthorized violence among my subjects!"</p>
<p>"_Our_ subjects," added Drax, with a meaningful glare.</p>
<p>"_Our_ subjects," amended Dran. "We must take immediate action."</p>
<p>"Agreed."</p>
<p>"Agreed."</p>
<p>"I shall issue orders forbidding their engagement in activities leading
to bloodshed."</p>
<p>"I presume that you mean a joint proclamation," stated Drax.</p>
<p>"Of course. I was not slighting you, I was simply shaken by  the  civil
emergency.  We  shall  draft an official proclamation. Let Zindrome fetch us
writing instruments."</p>
<p>"Zindrome, fetch--"</p>
<p>"I have them here, my Lords."</p>
<p>"Now, let me see. How shall we phrase it...?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I should clean the palace while your Excellencies--"</p>
<p>"No! Wait right here! This will be very brief and to the point."</p>
<p>"Mm. 'We hereby proclaim...'"</p>
<p>"Don't forget our titles."</p>
<p>"True. 'We, the imperial monarchs of Glan, herebeneath undersigned,  do
hereby...'"</p>
<p>A  feeble  pulse  of gamma rays passed unnoticed by the two rulers. The
faithful Zindrome diagnosed its nature, however, and tried unsuccessfully to
obtain the monarchs' attention. Finally, he dismissed  the  project  with  a
stoical gesture typical of his kind. He waited.</p><empty-line/><p>"There!" they agreed flourishing the document.  "Now you can tell us
what you have been trying to say, Zindrome.  But make it brief, you
must deliver this soon."</p>
<p>"It  is already too late, great Lords. This race, also, progressed into
civilized states, developed nuclear energy and eradicated itself  while  you
were writing."</p>
<p>"Barbarous!"</p>
<p>"Warm-blooded irresponsibility!"</p>
<p>"May I go clean up now, great Masters?"</p>
<p>"Soon,  Zindrome,  soon.  First,  though,  I  move  that  we  file  the
proclamation in the Archives  for  future  use,  in  the  event  of  similar
occurrences."</p>
<p>Dran nodded.</p>
<p>"I agree. _We_ so order."</p>
<p>The robot accepted the crumbling proclamation and vanished from sight.</p>
<p>"You  know,"  Drax  mused,  "there must be lots of radioactive material
lying about now..."</p>
<p>"There probably is."</p>
<p>"It could be used to fuel a ship for another expedition."</p>
<p>"Perhaps."</p>
<p>"This time we could instruct Zindrome to bring back  something  with  a
longer lifespan and more deliberate habits--somewhat nearer our own."</p>
<p>"That  would have its dangers. But perhaps we could junk the Mono-Robot
Protection Pact and order Zindrome to manufacture extras of  himself.  Under
strict supervision."</p>
<p>"That would have its dangers too."</p>
<p>"At any rate, I should have to ponder your suggestion carefully."</p>
<p>"And I yours."</p>
<p>"It's been a busy day," nodded Dran. "Let's sleep on it."</p>
<p>"A good idea."</p>
<p>Sounds of saurian snoring emerged from the great Throne Hall of Glan.</p><empty-line/>

<section>

<p>Forced  to  admit  that  his  art was going unnoticed in a
frivolous world, Jay Smith decided to get out  of  that  world.
The  four  dollars  and  ninety-eight cents he spent for a mail
order course entitled <emphasis>Yoga--the  Path  to  Freedom</emphasis>  did  not,
however,  help to free him. Rather, it served to accentuate his
humanity, in that it reduced his ability to  purchase  food  by
four dollars and ninety-eight cents.</p>
<p>Seated  in  a padmasana, Smith contemplated little but the
fact that his navel drew slightly closer to his  backbone  with
each  day  that  passed. While nirvana is a reasonably esthetic
concept, suicide assuredly is not, particularly if you  haven't
the stomach for it. So he dismissed the fatalistic notion quite
reasonably.</p>
<p>"How  simply  one  could  take  one's  own  life  in ideal
surroundings!" he sighed, (tossing his golden locks which,  for
obvious  reasons, had achieved classically impressive lengths).
"The fat stoic in his bath, fanned by slave girls  and  sipping
his  wine,  as  a  faithful  Greek  leech opens his veins, eyes
downcast! One delicate Circassian," he sighed  again,  "<emphasis>there</emphasis>
perhaps,  plucking  upon  a  lyre  as  he  dictates his funeral
oration--the latter to be read by a faithful  countryman,  eyes
all  a-blink.  How  easily  <emphasis>he</emphasis>  might  do  it! But the fallen
artist--say! Born yesterday and scorned today he goes, like the
elephant to his graveyard, alone and secret!"</p>
<p>He rose to his full height of six feet,  one  and  a  half
inches,  and  swung  to  face  the  mirror. Regarding his skin,
pallid as marble, and his straight nose,  broad  forehead,  and
wide-spaced  eyes,  he  decided  that  if one could not live by
creating art, then one might do worse that turn the  thing  the
other way about, so to speak.</p>
<p>He flexed those thews which had earned him half-tuition as
a halfback for the four years in which he had stoked the stithy
of his  soul  to  the  forging  out  of a movement all his own:
two-dimensional painted sculpture.</p>
<p>"Viewed in the  round,"  one  crabbed  critic  had  noted,
"Mister  Smith's offerings are either frescoes without walls or
vertical lines. The  Etruscans  excelled  in  the  former  form
because  they knew where it belonged; kindergartens inculcate a
mastery of the latter in all five-year-olds."</p>
<p>Cleverness! More cleverness! Bah! He  was  sick  of  those
Johnsons who laid down the law at someone else's dinner table!</p>
<p>He  noted  with  satisfaction  that his month-long ascetic
regime had reduced his weight by thirty pounds to  a  mere  two
twenty-five.  He  decided  that  he  could  pass  as  a  Beaten
Gladiator, post-Hellenic.</p>
<p>"It is settled," he pronounced. "I'll <emphasis>be</emphasis> art."
Later that afternoon a lone figure entered the Museum of Art, a
bundle beneath his arm.</p>
<p>Spiritually  haggard   (although   clean-shaven   to   the
armpits),  Smith  loitered  about the Greek Period until it was
emptied of all but himself and marble.</p>
<p>He selected a dark corner and unwrapped his  pedestal.  He
secreted  the  various personal things necessary for a showcase
existence, including  most  of  his  clothing,  in  its  hollow
bottom.</p>
<p>"Good-bye,  world,"  he  renounced, "you should treat your
artists better," and mounted the pedestal.</p>
<p>His food money had not been  completely  wasted,  for  the
techniques  he  had mastered for four ninety-eight while on the
Path to Freedom, had given  him  a  muscular  control  such  as
allowed  him  perfect,  motionless statuity whenever the wispy,
middle-aged woman followed by  forty-four  children  under  age
nine, left her chartered bus at the curb and passed through the
Greek  Period,  as  she  did every Tuesday and Thursday between
9:35 and 9:40 in the morning. Fortunately, he  had  selected  a
seated posture.</p>
<p>Before  the  week  passed he had also timed the watchman's
movements to an alternate <emphasis>tick</emphasis>  of  the  huge  clock  in  the
adjacent  gallery (a delicate Eighteenth Century timepiece, all
of gold leaf, enamel, and small angels who chased  one  another
around  in circles). He should have hated being reported stolen
during the first week of his career, with nothing to face  then
but  the prospect of second-rate galleries or an uneasy role in
the cheerless private  collections  of  cheerless  and  private
collectors.   Therefore,  he  moved  judiciously  when  raiding
staples from the stores  in  the  downstairs  lunch  room,  and
strove  to  work out a sympathetic bond with the racing angels.
The directors had never seen fit to secure the refrigerator  or
pantry  from  depredations  by  the  exhibits, and he applauded
their lack  of  imagination.  He  nibbled  at  boiled  ham  and
pumpernickel  (light), and munched ice cream bars by the dozen.
After a month he was forced to take calisthenics (heavy) in the
Bronze Age.</p>
<p>"Oh, lost!" he reflected amidst the  Neos,  surveying  the
kingdom  he  had  once  staked out as his own. He wept over the
statue of Achilles Fallen as though it were his own. It was.</p>
<p>As in a mirror, he regarded himself in a handy collage  of
bolts and nutshells. "If you had not sold out," he accused, "if
<emphasis>you</emphasis>  had hung on a little longer--like these, the simplest of
Art's creatures...But no! It could not be!</p>
<p>"Could it?" he addressed a particularly symmetrical mobile
overhead. "<emphasis>Could</emphasis> it?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps," came an answer from  nowhere,  which  sent  him
flying back to his pedestal.</p>
<p>But little came of it. The watchman had been taking guilty
delight in a buxom Rubens on the other side of the building and
had not  overheard  the  colloquy. Smith decided that the reply
signified his accidental nearing of Dharana. He returned to the
Path,  redoubling  his  efforts  toward  negation  and  looking
Beaten.
In the days that followed he heard occasional chuckling and
whispering, which he at first dismissed as the chortlings of the
children of Mara and Maya, intent upon his distractions.  Later, he
was less certain, but by then he had decided upon a classical attitude
of passive inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>And one spring day, as green and golden as a poem by Dylan
Thomas,  a  girl  entered  the  Greek  Period and looked about,
furtively.  He  found  it  difficult  to  maintain  his  marbly
placidity, for lo! she began to disrobe!</p>
<p>And  a  square parcel on the floor, in a plain wrapper. It
could only mean...</p>
<p>Competition!</p>
<p>He coughed politely, softly, classically...</p>
<p>She jerked to an amazing attention,  reminding  him  of  a
women's  underwear  ad  having to do with Thermopylae. Her hair
was the correct color for the undertaking--that palest shade of
Parian  manageable--and  her  gray  eyes  glittered  with   the
icy-orbed intentness of Athene.</p>
<p>She surveyed the room minutely, guiltily, attractively...</p>
<p>"Surely stone is not susceptible to virus infections," she
decided.  "'Tis  but  my  guilty  conscience  that  cleared its
throat. Conscience, thus do I cast thee off!"</p>
<p>And she proceeded to become Hecuba  Lamenting,  diagonally
across from the Beaten Gladiator and fortunately, not facing in
his  direction.  She handled it pretty well, too, he grudgingly
admitted. Soon she achieved an  esthetic  immobility.  After  a
period of appraisal he decided that Athens was indeed mother of
all  the  arts;  she  simply  could  not  have  carried  it  as
Renaissance nor Romanesque. This made him feel rather good.</p>
<p>When the great doors finally swung shut and the alarms had
been set she heaved a sigh and sprang to the floor.</p>
<p>"Not yet," he cautioned, "the watchman will  pass  through
in ninety-three seconds."</p>
<p>She  had presence of mind sufficient to stifle her scream,
a delicate hand with which to do it, and  eighty-seven  seconds
in  which  to  become Hecuba Lamenting once more. This she did,
and he admired her delicate hand and her presence of  mind  for
the next eighty-seven seconds.
The watch man came, was nigh, was gone, flashlight and beard bobbing
in musty will o' the-wispfulness through the gloom.</p>
<p>"Goodness!"  she expelled her breath. "I had thought I was
alone!"</p>
<p>"And correctly so," he replied. "'Naked and alone we  come
into  exile...Among  bright  stars  on this most weary unbright
cinder, lost...Oh, lost--'"</p>
<p>"Thomas Wolfe," she stated.</p>
<p>"Yes," he sulked. "Let's go have supper."</p>
<p>"Supper?" she inquired, arching her  eyebrows.  "Where?  I
had  brought  some  K-Rations,  which  I  purchased  at an Army
Surplus Store--"</p>
<p>"Obviously,"  he  retorted,  "you  have  a   short-timer's
attitude.  I  believe  that  chicken figured prominently on the
menu for today. Follow me!"</p>
<p>They made their way  through  the  Tang  Dynasty,  to  the
stairs.</p>
<p>"Others  might  find  it  chilly  in here after hours," he
began,  "but  I  daresay  you  have  thoroughly  mastered   the
techniques of breath control?"</p>
<p>"Indeed,"  she  replied,  "my  fiancee  was  no  mere  Zen
faddist. He followed the more rugged path  of  Lhasa.  Once  he
wrote  a  modern  version  of  the  Ramayana,  full  of topical
allusions and advice to modern society."</p>
<p>"And what did modern society think of it?"</p>
<p>"Alas! Modern society never saw it. My parents bought  him
a  one-way  ticket  to  Rome,  first-class, and several hundred
dollars worth of Travelers'  Checks.  He  has  been  gone  ever
since. That is why I have retired from the world."</p>
<p>"I take it your parents do not approve of Art?"</p>
<p>"No, and I believe they must have threatened him also."</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"Such  is  the  way  of society with genius. I, too, in my
small way, have worked for  its  betterment  and  received  but
scorn for my labors."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. If we stop in the Modern Period on the way back, you
can see my Achilles Fallen."</p>
<p>A very dry chuckle halted them.</p>
<p>"Who is there?" he inquired, cautiously.</p>
<p>No  reply.  They stood in the Glory of Rome, and the stone
senators were still.</p>
<p>"<emphasis>Someone</emphasis> laughed," she observed.</p>
<p>"We are not alone," he stated, shrugging.  "There've  been
other  indications  of  such,  but whoever they are, they're as
talkative as Trappists--which is good.</p>
<p>Remember, though art but stone," he called gaily, and they
continued on to the cafeteria.
One night they sat together at dinner in the Modern Period.</p>
<p>"Had you a name, in life?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Gloria," she whispered. "And yours?"</p>
<p>"Smith, Jay."</p>
<p>"What prompted you to become a statue, Smith--if it is not
too bold of me to ask?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," he smiled,  invisibly.  "Some  are  born  to
obscurity and others only achieve it through diligent effort. I
am  one  of the latter. Being an artistic failure, and broke, I
decided to become my own  monument.  It's  warm  in  here,  and
there's  food  below.  The  environment  is congenial, and I'll
never be found out  because  no  one  ever  looks  at  anything
standing around museums."</p>
<p>"No one?"</p>
<p>"Not  a soul, as you must have noticed. Children come here
against their wills,  young  people  come  to  flirt  with  one
another,  and  when one develops sufficient sensibility to look
at anything," he lectured bitterly, "he  is  either  myopic  or
subject  to  hallucinations.  In  the  former case he would not
notice, in the latter he would not talk. The parade passes."</p>
<p>"Then what good are museums?"</p>
<p>"My dear girl! That the former affianced of a true  artist
should  speak in such a manner indicates that your relationship
was but brief--"</p>
<p>"Really!"   she   interrupted.   "The   proper   word   is
'companionship'."</p>
<p>"Very  well,"  he  amended,  "'companionship'. But museums
mirror the past,  which  is  dead,  the  present,  which  never
notices,  and  transmit  the  race's  cultural  heritage to the
future, which is not yet born. In this, they are near to  being
temples of religion."</p>
<p>"I  never  thought  of  it that way," she mused. "Rather a
beautiful thought, too. You should really be a teacher."</p>
<p>"It doesn't pay well enough, but the thought consoles  me.
Come, let us raid the icebox again."</p>
<p>They  nibbled  their  final  ice  cream bars and discussed
Achilles  Fallen,  seated  beneath  the  great   mobile   which
resembled  a  starved  octopus.  He told her of his other great
projects and of the nasty reviewers, crabbed and bloodless, who
lurked in Sunday editions and hated life. She,  in  turn,  told
him  of  her  parents,  who  knew  Art  and  also  knew why she
shouldn't like him, and of her parents' vast fortunes,  equally
distributed in timber, real estate, and petroleum. He, in turn,
patted  her  arm  and  she, in turn, blinked heavily and smiled
Hellenically.</p>
<p>"You know," he said, finally, "as I sat upon my  pedestal,
day  after  day,  I  often  thought to myself: Perhaps I should
return and make one more effort to pierce the cataract  in  the
eye  of  the public--perhaps if I were as secure and at ease in
all  things  material--perhaps  if  I  could  find  the  proper
woman--but nay! There is no such a one!"</p>
<p>"Continue!  Pray continue!" cried she. "I, too, have, over
the past days, thought  that,  perhaps,  another  artist  could
remove  the  sting.  Perhaps  the poison of loneliness could be
drawn by a creator of beauty--If we--"
At this point a small and ugly man in a toga cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"It is as I feared," he announced.</p>
<p>Lean, wrinkled, and grubby was he; a man of ulcerous bowel
and much spleen. He pointed an accusing finger.</p>
<p>"It is as I feared," he repeated.</p>
<p>"Wh-who are you?" asked Gloria.</p>
<p>"Cassius," he replied,  "Cassius  Fitzmullen--art  critic,
retired, for the Dalton <emphasis>Times</emphasis>. You are planning to defect."</p>
<p>"And  what  concern  is  it  of  yours if we leave?" asked
Smith, flexing his Beaten Gladiator halfback muscles.</p>
<p>Cassius shook his head.</p>
<p>"Concern? It would threaten a way of life for you to leave
now. If you go, you  will  doubtless  become  an  artist  or  a
teacher  of art--and sooner or later, by word or by gesture, by
sign of by unconscious indication, you  will  communicate  what
you   have  suspected  all  along.  I  have  listened  to  your
conversations over the past weeks. You know, for  certain  now,
that this is where all art critics finally come, to spend their
remaining  days mocking the things they have hated. It accounts
for the increase of Roman Senators in recent years."</p>
<p>"I have often suspected it, but never was certain."</p>
<p>"The suspicion is  enough.  It  is  lethal.  You  must  be
judged."</p>
<p>He clapped his hands.</p>
<p>"Judgment!" he called.</p>
<p>Other  ancient Romans entered slowly, a procession of bent
candles. They encircled the two lovers. Smelling  of  dust  and
yellow newsprint and bile and time, the old reviewers hovered.</p>
<p>"They  wish  to  return  to  humanity," announced Cassius.
"They wish to leave and take their knowledge with them."</p>
<p>"We would not tell," said Gloria, tearfully.</p>
<p>"It is too  late,"  replied  one  dark  figure.  "You  are
already entered into the Catalog. See here!" He produced a copy
and  read: "'Number 28, Hecuba Lamenting. Number 32, The Beaten
Gladiator.'  No!  It  is  too   late.   There   would   be   an
investigation."</p>
<p>"Judgment!" repeated Cassius.</p>
<p>Slowly, the Senators turned their thumbs down.</p>
<p>"You <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> leave."</p>
<p>Smith  chuckled  and  seized  Cassius' tunic in a powerful
sculptor's grip.</p>
<p>"Little man," he said, "how do you  propose  stopping  us?
One  scream by Gloria would bring the watchman, who would sound
an alarm. One blow by me would render  you  unconscious  for  a
week."</p>
<p>"We  shut off the guard's hearing aid as he slept," smiled
Cassius. "Critics are not without imagination,  I  assure  you.
Release me, or you will suffer."</p>
<p>Smith tightened his grip.</p>
<p>"Try <emphasis>anything</emphasis>."</p>
<p>"Judgment," smiled Cassius.</p>
<p>"He is modern," said one.</p>
<p>"Therefore, his tastes are catholic," said another.</p>
<p>"To  the  lions  with  the Christians!" announced a third,
clapping his hands.</p>
<p>And Smith sprang back in panic at what he thought  he  saw
moving in the shadows. Cassius pulled free.</p>
<p>"You cannot do this!" cried Gloria, covering her face. "We
are from the Greek Period!"</p>
<p>"When in Greece, do as the Romans do," chuckled Cassius.</p>
<p>The odor of cats came to their nostrils.</p>
<p>"How could you--here...? A lion?" asked Smith.</p>
<p>"A  form  of  hypnosis  privy to the profession," observed
Cassius. "We keep the beast paralyzed most of  the  time.  Have
you  not  wondered  why  there has never been a theft from this
museum? Oh, it has  been  tried,  all  right!  We  protect  our
interests."</p>
<p>The lean, albino lion which generally slept beside the main entrance
padded slowly from the shadows and growled--once, and loudly.</p>
<p>Smith  pushed  Gloria  behind  him  as  the  cat began its
stalking. He glanced towards the  Forum,  which  proved  to  be
vacant.  A  sound,  like  the  flapping  of wings by a flock of
leather pigeons, diminished in the distance.</p>
<p>"We are alone," noted Gloria.</p>
<p>"Run," ordered Smith, "and I'll try to delay him. Get out,
if you can."</p>
<p>"And desert  you?  Never,  my  dear!  Together!  Now,  and
always!"</p>
<p>"Gloria!"</p>
<p>"Jay Smith!"</p>
<p>At  that  moment  the beast conceived the notion to launch
into a spring, which it promptly did.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, my lovely."</p>
<p>"Farewell. One kiss before dying, pray."</p>
<p>The lion was high in the  air,  uttering  healthy  coughs,
eyes greenly aglow.</p>
<p>"Very well."</p>
<p>They embraced.</p>
<p>Moon  hacked  in  the  shape of cat, that palest of beasts
hung overhead--hung high, hung menacingly, hung long...</p>
<p>It began to writhe and claw about wildly  in  that  middle
space   between   floor  and  ceiling  for  which  architecture
possesses no specific noun.</p>
<p>"Mm! Another kiss?"</p>
<p>"Why not? Life is sweet."</p>
<p>A minute ran by on noiseless feet; another pursued it.</p>
<p>"I say, what's holding up that lion?"</p>
<p>"I am," answered the mobile. "You humans aren't  the  only
ones to seek umbrage amidst the relics of your dead past."</p>
<p>The  voice  was thin, fragile, like that of a particularly
busy Aeolian Harp.</p>
<p>"I do not wish to seem inquisitive," said Smith, "but  who
are you?"</p>
<p>"I  am an alien life form," it tinkled back, digesting the
lion. "My ship suffered an accident on the way to  Arcturus.  I
soon  discovered  that  my  appearance  was  against me on your
planet, except in the museums,  where  I  am  greatly  admired.
Being  a  member  of  a  rather  delicate  and, if I do say it,
somewhat narcissistic race--" He paused to belch daintily,  and
continued,  "--I  rather  enjoy it here--'among bright stars on
this most weary unbright cinder [belch], lost'"</p>
<p>"I see," said Smith. "Thanks for eating the lion."</p>
<p>"Don't mention it--but it wasn't <emphasis>wholly</emphasis>  advisable.  You
see,  I'm going to have to divide now. Can the other me go with
you?"</p>
<p>"Of course. You saved our lives, and we're going  to  need
something to hang in the living room, when we have one."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>He  divided,  in  a  flurry  of  hemidemisemiquavers,  and
dropped to the floor beside them.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, me," he called upward.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," from above.</p>
<p>They walked proudly from the Modern,  through  the  Greek,
and past the Roman Period, with much hauteur and a wholly quiet
dignity.  Beaten  Gladiator,  Hecuba  Lamenting,  and  Xena  ex
Machina no longer, they lifted the sleeping watchman's key  and
walked  out  the  door, down the stairs, and into the night, on
youthful legs and drop-lines.

<p>The clock told him it was 10:33, going on 10:32 in the P.M.</p>

which  sucked  away  its glowing point, and then he shook the cigarette back
into the pack.</p>
<p>He yawned in reverse: first an exhalation, then an inhalation.</p>
<p>It wasn't real--the doctor had told him. It  was  grief  and  epilepsy,
meeting to form an unusual syndrome.</p>
<p>He'd  already had the seizure. The dialantin wasn't helping. This was a
post-traumatic locomotor hallucination, elicited by anxiety, precipitated by
the attack.</p>
<p>But he did not believe it,  could  not  believe  it--not  after  twenty
minutes  had  gone  by,  in the other direction--not after he had placed the
book upon the reading stand, stood, walked backward across the room  to  his
closet, hung up his robe, redressed himself in the same shirts and slacks he
had  worn all day, backed over to the bar and regurgitated a Martini, sip by
cooling sip, until the glass was filled to the brim and not a drop spilled.</p>
<p>There was an impending taste of olive, and then everything was  changed
again.</p>
<p>The  second-hand  was  sweeping  around  his  wristwatch  in the proper
direction.</p>
<p>The time was 10:07.</p>
<p>He felt free to move as he wished.</p>
<p>He redrank his Martini.</p>
<p>Now, if he would be true to the pattern, he would change into his  robe
and try to read. Instead, he mixed another drink.</p>
<p>Now the sequence would not occur.</p>
<p>Now  the  things  would not happen as he thought they had happened, and
un-happened.</p>
<p>Now everything was different.</p>
<p>All of which went to prove it had all been an hallucination.</p>
<p>Even the notion that it had taken twenty-six minutes each  way  was  an
attempted rationalization.</p>
<p>Nothing had happened.</p>
<p>...Shouldn't be drinking, he decided. It might bring on a seizure.</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>Crazy, though, the whole thing...</p>
<p>Remembering, he drank.</p>
<p>In the morning he skipped breakfast, as usual, noted that it would soon
stop being  morning,  took two aspirins, a lukewarm shower, a cup of coffee,
and a walk.</p>
<p>The park, the fountain, the children with their boats, the  grass,  the
pond,  he  hated them; and the morning, and the sunlight, and the blue moats
around the towering clouds.</p>
<p>Hating, he sat there. And remembering.</p>
<p>If he was on the verge of a crackup, he  decided,  then  the  thing  he
wanted  most was to plunge ahead into it, not to totter halfway out, halfway
in.</p>
<p>He remembered why.</p>
<p>But it was clear, so clear,  the  morning,  and  everything  crisp  and
distinct  and  burning  with the green fires of spring, there in the sign of
the Ram, April.</p>
<p>He watched the winds pile up the remains of winter against the far gray
fence, and he saw them push the boats across the pond, to come  to  rest  in
shallow mud the children tracked.</p>
<p>The  fountain  jetted  its  cold umbrella above the green-tinged copper
dolphins. The sun ignited it whenever he moved his head.  The  wind  rumpled
it.</p>
<p>Clustered on the concrete, birds pecked at part of a candy bar stuck to
a red wrapper.</p>
<p>Kites  swayed on their tails, nosed downward, rose again, as youngsters
tugged at invisible strings. Telephone lines were tangled with wooden frames
and torn paper, like broken G clefs and smeared glissandos.</p>
<p>He hated the telephone lines, the kites, the children, the birds.</p>
<p>Most of all, though, he hated himself.</p>
<p>How does a man undo that which has been done? He doesn't. There  is  no
way  under  the  sun.  He  may  suffer,  remember, repeat, curse, or forget.
Nothing else. The past, in this sense, is inevitable.</p>
<p>A woman walked past. He did not look up in time to see  her  face,  but
the  dusky  blonde fall of her hair to her collar and the swell of her sure,
sheer-netted legs below the black hem of her coat  and  above  the  matching
click  of  her  heels  heigh-ho,  stopped  his breath behind his stomach and
snared his eyes in the wizard-weft of her walking and her posture  and  some
more, like a rhyme to the last of his thoughts.</p>
<p>He  half-rose  from the bench when the pink static struck his eyeballs,
and the fountain became a volcano spouting rainbows.</p>
<p>The world was frozen and served up to him under a glass.</p>
<p>...The woman passed back before him and he looked down too soon to  see
her face.</p>
<p>The  hell  was beginning once more, he realized, as the backward-flying
birds passed before.</p>
<p>He gave himself up to it. Let it keep him until he broke, until he  was
all used up and there was nothing left.</p>
<p>He waited, there on the bench, watching the slivey toves be brillig, as
the fountain  sucked  its  waters  back  within itself, drawing them up in a
great arc above the unmoving dolphins, and the boats raced backward over the
pond, and the fence divested itself of stray scraps of paper, as  the  birds
replaced the candy bar within the red wrapper, bit by crunchy bit.</p>
<p>His  thoughts  only were inviolate, his body belonged to the retreating
tide.</p>
<p>Eventually, he rose and strolled backwards out of the park.</p>
<p>On the street a boy backed past him, unwhistling snatches of a  popular
song.</p>
<p>He  backed  up  the stairs to his apartment, his hangover growing worse
again, undrank his coffee, unshowered, unswallowed  his  aspirins,  and  got
into bed, feeling awful.</p>
<p>Let this be it, he decided.</p>
<p>A  faintly-remembered  nightmare ran in reverse though his mind, giving
it an undeserved happy ending.</p>
<p>It was dark when he awakened.</p>
<p>He was very drunk.</p>
<p>He backed over to the bar and began spitting out his drinks, one by one
into the same glass he had used the night before, and pouring them from  the
glass  back  into  the bottles again. Separating the gin and vermouth was no
trick at all. The liquids leapt into the air as he held the uncorked bottles
above the bar.</p>
<p>And he grew less and less drunk as this went on.</p>
<p>Then he stood before an early Martini and it  was  10:07  in  the  P.M.
There,  within  the  hallucination, he wondered about another hallucination.
Would time loop-the-loop, forward  and  then  backward  again,  through  his
previous seizure?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It was as though it had not happened, had never been.</p>
<p>He continued on back through the evening, undoing things.</p>
<p>He  raised  the telephone, said "good-bye", untold Murray that he would
not be coming to work again tomorrow, listened a moment, recradled the phone
and looked at it as it rang.</p>
<p>The sun came up in the west and people were backing their cars to work.</p>
<p>He read the weather report and the headlines, folded the evening  paper
and placed it out in the hall.</p>
<p>It was the longest seizure he had ever had, but he did not really care.
He settled himself down within it and watched as the day unwound itself back
to morning.</p>
<p>His hangover returned as the day grew smaller, and it was terrible when
he got into bed again.</p>
<p>When he awakened the previous evening the drunkenness was high upon him
again.  Two of the bottles he refilled, recorked, resealed. He knew he would
take them to the liquor store soon and get his money back.</p>
<p>As he sat there that day, his mouth uncursing and  undrinking  and  his
eyes unreading, he knew that new cars were being shipped back to Detroit and
disassembled,  that corpses were awakening into their death-throes, and that
priests the world over were saying black mass, unknowing.</p>
<p>He wanted to chuckle, but he could not tell his mouth to do it.</p>
<p>He unsmoked two and a half packs of cigarettes.</p>
<p>Then came another hangover and he went to bed. Later, the  sun  set  in
the east.</p>
<p>Time's  winged  chariot  fled before him as he opened the door and said
"good-bye" to his comforters and they came in and sat down and told him  not
to grieve overmuch.</p>
<p>And he wept without tears as he realized what was to come.</p>
<p>Despite his madness, he hurt.</p>
<p>...Hurt, as the days rolled backward.</p>
<p>...Backward, inexorably.</p>
<p>...Inexorably, until he knew the time was near at hand.</p>
<p>He gnashed the teeth of his mind.</p>
<p>Great was his grief and his hate and his love.</p>
<p>He  was  wearing his black suit and undrinking drink after drink, while
somewhere the men were scraping the clay back onto the shovels  which  would
be used to undig the grave.</p>
<p>He  backed  his  car to the funeral parlor, parked it, and climbed into
the limousine.</p>
<p>They backed all the way to the graveyard.</p>
<p>He stood among his friends and listened to the preacher.</p>
<p>".dust to dust; ashes to Ashes," the man said, which is pretty much the
same whichever way you say it.</p>
<p>The casket was taken back to the hearse and  returned  to  the  funeral
parlor.</p>
<p>He sat through the service and went home and unshaved and unbrushed his
teeth and went to bed.</p>
<p>He awakened and dressed again in black and returned to the parlor.</p>
<p>The flowers were all back in place.</p>
<p>Solemn-faced  friends  unsigned the Sympathy Book and unshook his hand.
Then they went inside to sit awhile and stare at  the  closed  casket.  Then
they left, until he was alone with the funeral director.</p>
<p>Then he was alone with himself.</p>
<p>The tears ran up his cheeks.</p>
<p>His shirt and suit were crisp and unwrinkled again.</p>
<p>He  backed home, undressed, uncombed his hair. The day collapsed around
him into morning, and he returned to bed to unsleep another night.</p>
<p>The previous evening, when  he  awakened,  he  realized  where  he  was
headed.</p>
<p>Twice,  he exerted all of his will power in an attempt to interrupt the
sequence of events. He failed.</p>
<p>He wanted to die. If he had killed himself that day, he  would  not  be
headed back toward it now.</p>
<p>There were tears within his mind as he realized the past which lay less
than twenty-four hours before him.</p>
<p>The  past  stalked  him that day as he unnegotiated the purchase of the
casket, the vault, the accessories.</p>
<p>Then he headed home into the biggest hangover of all and slept until he
was awakened to undrink drink after drink and then return to the morgue  and
come back in time to hang up the telephone on that call, that call which had
come to break...</p>
<p>...The silence of his anger with its ringing.</p>
<p>She was dead.</p>
<p>She  was  lying  somewhere in the fragments of her car on Interstate 90
now.</p>
<p>As he paced, unsmoking, he knew she was lying there bleeding.</p>
<p>...Then dying, after that crash at 80 miles an hour.</p>
<p>...Then alive?</p>
<p>Then re-formed, along with the car, and alive again, arisen?  Even  now
backing home at terrible speed, to re-slam the door on their final argument?
To unscream at him and to be unscreamed at?</p>
<p>He cried out within his mind. He wrung the hands of his spirit.</p>
<p>It couldn't stop at this point. No. Not now.</p>
<p>All  his grief and his love and his self-hate had brought him back this
far, this near to the moment...</p>
<p>It couldn't end now.</p>
<p>After a time, he moved to the living room, his legs  pacing,  his  lips
cursing, himself waiting.</p>
<p>The door slammed open.</p>
<p>She stared at him, her mascara smeared, tears upon her cheeks.</p>
<p>"!hell to go Then," he said.</p>
<p>"!going I'm," she said.</p>
<p>She stepped back inside, closed the door.</p>
<p>She hung her coat hurriedly in the hall closet.</p>
<p>".it about feel you way the that's If," he said shrugging.</p>
<p>"!yourself but anybody about care don't You," she said.</p>
<p>"!child a like behaving You're," he said.</p>
<p>"!sorry you're say least at could You"</p>
<p>Her  eyes  flashed  like  emeralds through the pink static, and she was
lovely and alive again. In his mind he was dancing.</p>
<p>The change came.</p>
<p>"You could at least say you're sorry!"</p>
<p>"I am," he said, taking her hand in a grip that she  could  not  break.
"How much, you'll never know."</p>
<p>"Come here," and she did.</p>

<p>He awoke to an ultrasonic wailing. It was a  thing  that  tortured  his
eardrums while remaining just beyond the threshold of the audible.</p>
<p>He scrambled to his feet in the darkness.</p>
<p>He  bumped against the walls several times. Dully, he realized that his
arms were sore, as though many needles had entered there.</p>
<p>The sound maddened him...</p>
<p>Escape! He had to get away!</p>
<p>A tiny patch of light occurred to his left.</p>
<p>He turned and raced toward it and it grew into a doorway.</p>
<p>He dashed through and stood blinking in the  glare  that  assailed  his
eyes.</p>
<p>He  was  naked,  he  was  sweating.  His  mind  was full of fog and the
rag-ends of dreams.</p>
<p>He heard a roar, as of a crowd, and he blinked against the brightness.</p>
<p>Towering, a dark figure stood before him in the distance.  Overcome  by
rage, he raced toward it, not quite certain why.</p>
<p>His  bare  feet  trod  hot  sand,  but he ignored the pain as he ran to
attack.</p>
<p>Some portion of his mind framed the question "Why?" but he ignored it.</p>
<p>Then he stopped.</p>
<p>A nude woman stood before him, beckoning, inviting, and  there  came  a
sudden surge of fire within his loins.</p>
<p>He turned slightly to his left and headed toward her.</p>
<p>She danced away.</p>
<p>He  increased his speed. But as he was about to embrace her, there came
a surge of fire in his right shoulder and she was gone.</p>
<p>He looked at his shoulder and an aluminum rod protruded  from  it,  and
the blood ran down along his arm. There arose another roar.</p>
<p>...And she appeared again.</p>
<p>He  pursued  her  once  more  and  his left shoulder burned with sudden
fires. She was gone and he stood shaking and sweating, blinking against  the
glare.</p>
<p>"It's a trick," he decided. "Don't play the game!"</p>
<p>She appeared again and he stood stock still, ignoring her.</p>
<p>He was assailed by fires, but he refused to move, striving to clear his
head.</p>
<p>The  dark  figure  appeared  once  more,  about  seven  feet  tall  and
possessing two pairs of arms.</p>
<p>It held something in one of its hands. If only the lighting  wasn't  so
crazy, perhaps he...</p>
<p>But he hated that dark figure and he charged it.</p>
<p>Pain lashed his side.</p>
<p>Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</p>
<p><emphasis>Crazy!   It's  all  crazy!</emphasis>  he  told  himself,  recalling  his
identity. <emphasis>This is a bullring and I'm a man, and that dark  thing  isn't.
Something's wrong.</emphasis></p>
<p>He  dropped to his hands and knees, buying time. He scooped up a double
fistful of sand while he was down.</p>
<p>There came proddings, electric and painful. He ignored them for as long
as he could, then stood.</p>
<p>The dark figure waved something at him and he felt himself hating it.</p>
<p>He ran toward it and stopped before it. He knew it was a game now.  His
name  was  Michael Cassidy. He was an attorney. New York. Of Johnson, Weems,
Daugherty and Cassidy. A man had stopped him,  asking  for  a  light.  On  a
street corner. Late at night. That he remembered.</p>
<p>He threw the sand at the creature's head.</p>
<p>It  swayed momentarily, and its arms were raised toward what might have
been its face.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, he tore the aluminum  rod  from  his  shoulder  and
drove its sharpened end into the creature's middle.</p>
<p>Something  touched  the back of his neck, and there was darkness and he
lay still for a long time.</p>
<p>When he could move again, he saw the dark figure and he tried to tackle
it.</p>
<p>He missed, and there was pain across his back and something wet.</p>
<p>When he stood once again, he bellowed, "You can't do this to me! I'm  a
man! Not a bull!"</p>
<p>There came a sound of applause.</p>
<p>He  raced  toward  the dark thing six times, trying to grapple with it,
hold it, hurt it. Each time, he hurt himself.</p>
<p>Then he stood, panting and gasping, and his  shoulders  ached  and  his
back  ached,  and his mind cleared a moment and he said, "You're God, aren't
you? And this is the way You play the game..."</p>
<p>The creature did not answer him and he lunged.</p>
<p>He stopped short, then dropped to one knee and dove against its legs.</p>
<p>He felt a fiery pain within his sides as he brought the dark one  to
earth. He struck at it twice with his fist, then the pain entered his breast
and he felt himself grow numb.</p>
<p>"Or are you?" he asked, thick-lipped. "No, you're not...Where am I?"</p>
<p>His last memory was of something cutting away at his ears.</p>

<section>
<empty-line/><p>They should have known that they  could  not  keep  me  bound  forever.
Probably they did, which is why there was always Stella.</p>
<p>I  lay  there  staring  over  at  her, arm outstretched above her head,
masses of messed blond hair framing her sleeping face.  She  was  more  than
wife to me: she was warden. How blind of me not to have realized it sooner!</p>
<p>But then, what else had they done to me?</p>
<p>They had made me to forget what I was.</p>
<p>Because  I was like them but not of them they had bound me to this time
and this place.</p>
<p>They had made me to forget. They had nailed me with love.</p>
<p>I stood up and the last chains fell away.</p>
<p>A single bar of moonlight lay upon  the  floor  of  the  bedchamber.  I
passed through it to where my clothing was hung.</p>
<p>There was a faint music playing in the distance. That was what had done
it. It had been so long since I had heard that music...</p>
<p>How had they trapped me?</p>
<p>That  little  kingdom,  ages  ago,  some  Other, where I had introduced
gunpowder-- Yes! That was the place! They  had  trapped  me  there  with  my
Other-made monk's hood and my classical Latin.</p>
<p>Then brainsmash and binding to this Otherwhen.</p>
<p>I  chuckled softly as I finished dressing. How long had I lived in this
place? Forty-five years of memory--but how much of it counterfeit?</p>
<p>The hall mirror showed me  a  middle-aged  man,  slightly  obese,  hair
thinning, wearing a red sport shirt and black slacks.</p>
<p>The music was growing louder, the music only I could hear: guitars, and
the steady _thump_ of a leather drum.</p>
<p>My  different  drummer, aye! Mate me with an angel and you still do not
make me a saint, my comrades!</p>
<p>I made myself young and strong again.</p>
<p>Then I descended the stair to the living room, moved to the bar, poured
out a glass  of  wine,  sipped  it  until  the  music  reached  its  fullest
intensity,  then  gulped  the remainder and dashed the glass to the floor. I
was free!</p>
<p>I turned to go, and there was a sound overhead.</p>
<p>Stella had awakened.</p>
<p>The telephone rang. It hung there on the wall and rang and rang until I
could stand it no longer.</p>
<p>"You have done it again," said that old, familiar voice.</p>
<p>"Do not go hard with the woman,"  said  I.  "She  could  not  watch  me
always."</p>
<p>"It  will  be  better if you stay right where you are," said the voice.
"It will save us both much trouble."</p>
<p>"Good night," I said, and hung up.</p>
<p>The receiver snapped itself around my wrist and the cord became a chain
fastened to a ring-bolt in the wall. How childish of them!</p>
<p>I heard Stella dressing upstairs. I moved eighteen steps sidewise  from
There,  to  the  place  where  my scaled limb slid easily from out the vines
looped about it.</p>
<p>Then, back again to the living room and out the front door. I needed  a
mount.</p>
<p>I  backed  the  convertible out of the garage. It was the faster of the
two cars. Then out onto the nighted highway, and then  a  sound  of  thunder
overhead.</p>
<p>It  was  a Piper Cub, sweeping in low, out of control. I slammed on the
brakes and it came on, shearing treetops and snapping  telephone  lines,  to
crash  in  the middle of the street half a block ahead of me. I took a sharp
left turn into an alley, and then onto the next street paralleling my own.</p>
<p>If they wanted to play it that way,  well--I  am  not  exactly  without
resources  along  those  lines  myself.  I was pleased that they had done it
first, though.</p>
<p>I headed out into the country, to where I could  build  up  a  head  of
steam.</p>
<p>Lights appeared in my rearview mirror.</p>
<p>Them?</p>
<p>Too soon.</p>
<p>It was either just another car headed this way, or it was Stella.</p>
<p>Prudence, as the Greek Chorus says, is better than imprudence.</p>
<p>I shifted, not gears.</p>
<p>I was whipping along in a lower, more powerful car.</p>
<p>Again, I shifted.</p>
<p>I  was  driving  from  the  wrong side of the vehicle and headed up the
wrong side of the highway.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>No wheels. My car sped forward on a cushion of air, above a beaten  and
dilapidated  highway.  All  the buildings I passed were of metal. No wood or
stone or brick had gone into the construction of anything I saw.</p>
<p>On the long curve behind me, a pair of headlights appeared.</p>
<p>I killed my own lights and shifted, again and again, and again.</p>
<p>I shot through the air, high above a great swampland,  stringing  sonic
booms  like  beads  along  the thread of my trail. Then another shift, and I
shot low over the steaming land where great reptiles raised their heads like
beanstalks from out their wallows. The sun stood high in this world, like an
acetylene torch in the heavens. I held the struggling vehicle together by an
act of will and waited for pursuit. There was none.</p>
<p>I shifted again...</p>
<p>There was a black forest reaching almost to the foot of the  high  hill
upon  which the ancient castle stood. I was mounted on a hippogriff, flying,
and garbed in the manner of a warrior-mage. I steered my mount to a  landing
within the forest.</p>
<p>"Become a horse," I ordered, giving the proper guide-word.</p>
<p>Then  I  was  mounted  upon  a black stallion, trotting along the trail
which twisted through the dark forest.</p>
<p>Should I remain here and fight them with magic, or  move  on  and  meet
them in a world where science prevailed?</p>
<p>Or  should  I  beat a circuitous route from here to some distant Other,
hoping to elude them completely?</p>
<p>My questions answered themselves.</p>
<p>There came a clatter of hoofs at my back, and a knight appeared: he was
mounted upon a tall, proud steed; he wore burnished armor; upon  his  shield
was set a cross of red.</p>
<p>"You have come far enough," he said. "Draw rein!"</p>
<p>The  blade  he  bore upraised was a wicked and gleaming weapon, until I
transformed it into a serpent. He dropped it then, and it slithered off into
the underbrush.</p>
<p>"You were saying...?"</p>
<p>"Why don't you give up?" he asked. "Join us, or quit trying?"</p>
<p>"Why don't _you_ give up? Quit them and join with me? We  could  change
many times and places together. You have the ability, and the training..."</p>
<p>By  then he was close enough to lunge, in an attempt to unhorse me with
the edge of his shield.</p>
<p>I gestured and his horse stumbled, casting him to the ground.</p>
<p>"Everywhere you go, plagues and wars follow at your heels!" he gasped.</p>
<p>"All progress demands payment. These are the growing pains of which you
speak, not the final results."</p>
<p>"Fool! There is no such thing as progress! Not as you see it! What good
are all the machines and ideas you unloose in their cultures, if you do  not
change the men themselves?"</p>
<p>"Thought  and  mechanism  advances;  men  follow slowly," I said, and I
dismounted and moved to his side. "All that your kind seek  is  a  perpetual
Dark Age on all planes of existence. Still, I am sorry for what I must do."</p>
<p>I unsheathed the knife at my belt and slipped it through his visor, but
the helm  was  empty.  He  had  escaped into another Place, teaching me once
again the futility of arguing with an ethical evolutionary.</p>
<p>I remounted and rode on.</p>
<p>After a time, there came again the sound of hoofs at my back.</p>
<p>I spoke another word, which mounted me upon a sleek unicorn, to move at
blinding speed through the dark wood. The pursuit continued, however.</p>
<p>Finally, I came upon a small  clearing,  a  cairn  piled  high  in  its
center.  I  recognized it as a place of power, so I dismounted and freed the
unicorn, which promptly vanished.</p>
<p>I climbed the cairn and sat at its top. I lit a cigar and waited. I had
not expected to be located so soon, and it irritated me.  I  would  confront
this pursuer here.</p>
<p>A sleek gray mare entered the clearing.</p>
<p>"Stella!"</p>
<p>"Get  down  from  there!"  she cried. "They are preparing to unleash an
assault any moment now!"</p>
<p>"Amen," I said. "I am ready for it."</p>
<p>"They outnumber you! They always have! You will lose to them again, and
again and again, so long as you persist in fighting. Come down and come away
with me. It may not be too late!"</p>
<p>"Me, retire?" I asked. "I'm an institution. They would soon be  out  of
crusades without me. Think of the boredom--"</p>
<p>A  bolt  of  lightning dropped from the sky, but it veered away from my
cairn and fried a nearby tree.</p>
<p>"They've started!"</p>
<p>"Then get out of here, girl. This isn't your fight."</p>
<p>"You're mine!"</p>
<p>"I'm my own! Nobody else's! Don't forget it!"</p>
<p>"I love you!"</p>
<p>"You betrayed me!"</p>
<p>"No. You say that you love humanity."</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"I don't believe you! You couldn't, after all you've done to it!"</p>
<p>I raised my hand. "I banish thee from this Now and Here," I said, and I
was alone again.</p>
<p>More lightnings descended, charring the ground about me.</p>
<p>I shook my fist.</p>
<p>"Don't you _ever_ give up? Give me a century  of  peace  to  work  with
them,  and  I'll  show  you  a  world that you don't believe could exist!" I
cried.</p>
<p>In answer, the ground began to tremble.</p>
<p>I fought them. I hurled their lightnings back in their faces. When  the
winds  arose,  I bent them inside-out. But the earth continued to shake, and
cracks appeared at the foot of the cairn.</p>
<p>"Show yourselves!" I cried. "Come at me one at a time, and  I'll  teach
you of the power I wield!"</p>
<p>But the ground opened up and the cairn came apart.</p>
<p>I fell into darkness.</p>
<p>I  was  running. I had shifted three times, and I was a furred creature
now with a pack howling at my heels, eyes like fiery headlights, fangs  like
swords.</p>
<p>I  was  slithering  among  the  dark  roots  of  the  banyan,  and  the
long-billed criers were probing after my scaly body...</p>
<p>I was darting on the wings of a hummingbird and I heard the  cry  of  a
hawk...</p>
<p>I was swimming through blackness and there came a tentacle...</p>
<p>I broadcast away, peaking and troughing at a high frequency.</p>
<p>I met with static.</p>
<p>I was falling and they were all around me.</p>
<p>I was taken, as a fish is taken in a net. I was snared, bound...</p>
<p>I heard her weeping somewhere.</p>
<p>"Why  do you try, again and ever again?" she asked. "Why can you not be
content with me, with a life of peace and leisure? Do you not remember  what
they  have  done  to  you in the past? Were not your days with me infinitely
better?"</p>
<p>"No!" I cried.</p>
<p>"I love you," she said.</p>
<p>"Such love is an imaginary number," I told her, and I was  raised  from
where I lay and borne away.</p>
<p>She followed behind, weeping.</p>
<p>"I  pleaded with them to give you a chance at peace, but you threw that
gift in my face."</p>
<p>"The peace of the eunuch; the peace of lobotomy, lotus and  Thorazine,"
I  said.  "No, better they work their wills upon me and let their truth give
forth its lies as they do."</p>
<p>"Can you really say that and mean it?" she  asked.  "Have  you  already
forgotten  the  sun  of  the Caucasus--the vulture tearing at your side, day
after hot red day?"</p>
<p>"I do not forget," I said, "but I curse them. I will oppose them  until
the ends of When and Wherever, and someday I shall win."</p>
<p>"I love you," she said.</p>
<p>"How can you say that and mean it?"</p>
<p>"Fool!"  came  a chorus of voices, as I was laid upon this rock in this
cavern and chained.</p>
<p>All day long a bound serpent spits venom into my face, and she holds  a
pan  to  catch it. It is only when the woman who betrayed me must empty that
pan that it spits into my eyes and I scream.</p>
<p>But I _will_ come free again, to aid  long-suffering  mankind  with  my
many gifts, and there will be a trembling on high that day I end my bondage.
Until  then,  I  can only watch the delicate, unbearable bars of her fingers
across the bottom of that pan, and scream each time she takes them away.

<section>

<p>It  is  the  story  of  John  Auden and the Faioli, and no one knows it
better than I. Listen--</p>
<p>It happened on that evening, as he strolled (for there  was  no  reason
not  to  stroll)  in his favorite places in the whole world, that he saw the
Faioli near the Canyon of the Dead, seated on a rock,  her  wings  of  light
flickering,  flickering,  flickering and then gone, until it appeared that a
human girl was sitting there, dressed all in white and  weeping,  with  long
black tresses coiled about her waist.</p>
<p>He  approached her through the terrible light from the dying, half-dead
sun,  in  which  human  eyes  could  not  distinguish  distances  nor  grasp
perspectives properly (though his could), and he lay his right hand upon her
shoulder and spoke a word of greeting and of comfort.</p>
<p>It  was  as  if  he  did  not  exist,  however.  She continued to weep,
streaking with silver her cheeks the color of snow or  a  bone.  Her  almond
eyes looked forward as though they saw through him, and her long fingernails
dug into the flesh of her palm, though no blood was drawn.</p>
<p>Then  he  knew  that  it  was  true,  the  things  that are said of the
Faioli--that they see only the living and never the dead, and that they  are
formed  into the loveliest women in the entire universe. Being dead himself,
John Auden debated the consequences of becoming a living man once again, for
a time.</p>
<p>The  Faioli  were  known  to  come  to  a  man  the  month  before  his
death--those  rare  men who still died--and to live with such a man for that
final month of his existence, rendering to him every  pleasure  that  it  is
possible  for  a  human  being  to know, so that on the day when the kiss of
death is delivered, which sucks the remaining life from his body,  that  man
accepts  it--no,  seeks  it--with desire and grace, for such is the power of
the Faioli among all creatures that there is  nothing  more  to  be  desired
after such knowledge.</p>
<p>John  Auden  considered  his  life and his death, the conditions of the
world upon which he stood, the nature of his stewardship and his  curse  and
the  Faioli--who  was  the loveliest creature he had ever seen in all of his
four hundred thousand days of existence--and he touched  the  place  beneath
his  left  armpit  which  activated the necessary mechanism to make him live
again.</p>
<p>The creature stiffened beneath his touch, for suddenly  it  was  flesh,
his  touch, and flesh, warm and woman-filled, that he was touching, now that
the last sensations of life had returned to him. He knew that his touch  had
become the touch of a man once more.</p>
<p>"I  said  'hello,  and don't cry,'" he said, and her voice was like the
breezes he had forgotten through all the trees that he had  forgotten,  with
their  moisture  and  their  odors  and their colors all brought back to him
thus, "From where do you come, man? You were not here a moment ago."</p>
<p>"From the Canyon of the Dead," he said.</p>
<p>"Let me touch your face," and he did, and she did.</p>
<p>"It is strange that I did not feel you approach."</p>
<p>"This is a strange world," he replied.</p>
<p>"That is true," she said. "You are the only living thing upon it."</p>
<p>And he said, "What is your name?"</p>
<p>She said, "Call me Sythia," and he did.</p>
<p>"My name is John," he told her, "John Auden."</p>
<p>"I have come to be with you, to give you  comfort  and  pleasure,"  she
said, and he knew that the ritual was beginning.</p>
<p>"Why were you weeping when I found you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Because  I  thought  there  was  nothing upon this world, and I was so
tired from my travels," she told him. "Do you live near here?"</p>
<p>"Not far away," he answered. "Not far away at all."</p>
<p>"Will you take me there? To the place where you live?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>And she rose and followed him into the Canyon of  the  Dead,  where  he
made his home.</p>
<p>They  descended and they descended, and all about them were the remains
of people who had once lived. She did not seem to see these things, however,
but kept her eyes fixed upon John's face and her hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>"Why do you call this place the Canyon of the Dead?" she asked him.</p>
<p>"Because they are all about us here, the dead," he replied.</p>
<p>"I feel nothing."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>They crossed through the Valley of the Bones,  where  millions  of  the
dead  from many races and worlds lay stacked all about them, and she did not
see these things. She had come to the graveyard of all the  world,  but  she
did  not realize this thing. She had encountered its tender, its keeper, and
she did know what he was, he who staggered beside her like a man drunken.</p>
<p>John Auden took her to his home--not really the place where  he  lived,
but  it  would  be  now--and  there he activated ancient circuits within the
building within the mountains, and in response light leaped forth  from  the
walls, light he had never needed before but now required.</p>
<p>The door slid shut behind them and the temperature built up to a normal
warmth.  Fresh air circulated and he took it into his lungs and expelled it,
glorying in the forgotten sensation. His heart beat within his breast, a red
warm thing that reminded him of the pain and of the pleasure. For the  first
time  in  ages,  he prepared a meal and fetched a bottle of wine from one of
the deep, sealed lockers. How many others  could  have  borne  what  he  had
borne?</p>
<p>None, perhaps.</p>
<p>She dined with him, toying with the food, sampling a bit of everything,
eating  very  little.  He, on the other hand, glutted himself fantastically,
and they drank of the wine and were happy.</p>
<p>"This place is so strange," she said. "Where do you sleep?"</p>
<p>"I used to sleep in there," he told  her,  indicating  a  room  he  had
almost forgotten; and they entered and he showed it to her, and she beckoned
him toward the bed and the pleasures of her body.</p>
<p>That night he loved her, many times, with a desperation that burnt away
the alcohol and pushed all of his life forward with something like a hunger,
but more.</p>
<p>The  following  day,  when the dying sun had splashed the Valley of the
Bones with its pale, moonlike light, he awakened and she drew  his  head  to
her  breast, not having slept herself, and she asked him, "What is the thing
that moves you, John Auden? You are not like one of the men who live and who
die, but you take life almost like one of  the  Faioli,  squeezing  from  it
everything  that  you  can and pacing it at a tempo that bespeaks a sense of
time no man should know. What are you?"</p>
<p>"I am one who knows," he said. "I am one who knows that the days  of  a
man are numbered and one who covets their dispositions as he feels them draw
to a close."</p>
<p>"You are strange," said Sythia. "Have I pleased you?"</p>
<p>"More than anything else I have ever known," he said.</p>
<p>And she sighed, and he found her lips once again.</p>
<p>They  breakfasted, and that day they walked in the Valley of the Bones.
He could not distinguish distances nor grasp perspectives properly, and  she
could not see anything that had been living and now was dead. So, of course,
as  they  sat  there  on  a shelf of stone, his arm around her shoulders, he
pointed out to her the rocket which had just come down from out of the  sky,
and she squinted after his gesture. He indicated the robots, which had begun
unloading  the  remains of the dead of many world from the hold of the ship,
and she cocked her head to one side and stared ahead, but she did not really
see what he was talking about.</p>
<p>Even when one of the robots lumbered up to him and held out  the  board
containing  the receipt and the stylus, and as he signed the receipt for the
bodies received, she did  not  see  or  understand  what  it  was  that  was
occurring.</p>
<p>In  the  days that followed, his life took upon it a dreamlike quality,
filled with the pleasure of Sythia and shot through with certain  inevitable
streaks  of pain. Often, she saw him wince, and she asked him concerning his
expressions.</p>
<p>And always he would laugh and say, "Pleasure and pain are near  to  one
another," or some thing such as that.</p>
<p>And  as  the days wore on, she came to prepare the meals and to rub his
shoulders and mix his drinks and to recite to him certain pieces  of  poetry
he had somehow once come to love.</p>
<p>A  month.  A  month,  he knew, and it would come to an end. The Faioli,
whatever they were, paid for the life that they took with the  pleasures  of
the flesh. They always knew when a man's death was near at hand. And in this
sense,  they  always  gave  more  than  they  received. The life was fleeing
anyway, and they enhanced it before they took it away with them, to  nourish
themselves most likely, price of the things that they'd given.</p>
<p>Sythia  was mother-of-pearl, and her body was alternately cold and warm
to his caresses, and her mouth  was  a  tiny  flame,  igniting  wherever  it
touched,  with  its  teeth  like  needles and its tongue like the heart of a
flower. And so he came to know the thing called love for the  Faioli  called
Sythia.</p>
<p>Nothing really happened beyond the loving. He knew that she wanted him,
to use  him ultimately, and he was perhaps the only man in the universe able
to gull one of her kind. His  was  the  perfect  defense  against  life  and
against  death.  Now  that  he  was  human  and alive, he often wept when he
considered it.</p>
<p>He had more than a month to live.</p>
<p>He had maybe three or four.</p>
<p>This month, therefore, was a price he'd willingly pay for what  it  was
that the Faioli offered.</p>
<p>Sythia  racked  his  body  and  drained  from it every drop of pleasure
contained within his tired nerve cells. She turned  him  into  a  flame,  an
iceberg,  a  little  boy,  an old man. When they were together, his feelings
were such that he considered the _consolamentum_ as a thing he might  really
accept at the end of the month, which was drawing near. Why not? He knew she
had  filled  his  mind  with  her  presence,  on  purpose. But what more did
existence hold for him? This creature from beyond the stars had brought  him
every single thing a man could desire. She had baptized him with passion and
confirmed  him  with  the  quietude  which  follows after. Perhaps the final
oblivion of her final kiss were best after all.</p>
<p>He seized her and drew her to him. She did not understand him, but  she
responded.</p>
<p>He loved her for it, and this was almost his end.</p>
<p>There  is  a  thing called disease that battens upon all living things,
and he had known it beyond the scope  of  all  living  men.  She  could  not
understand, woman-thing who had known only of life.</p>
<p>So  he  never  tried to tell her, though with each day the taste of her
kisses grew stronger and saltier and each  seemed  to  him  a  strengthening
shadow,  darker and darker, stronger and heavier, of that one thing which he
now knew he desired most.</p>
<p>And the day would come. And come it did.</p>
<p>He held her and caressed her, and the calendars of all  his  days  fell
about them.</p>
<p>He  knew,  as  he abandoned himself to her ploys and the glories of her
mouth, her breasts, that he had been ensnared, as had all men who had  known
them,  by  the  power of the Faioli. Their strength was their weakness. They
were the ultimate in Woman. By  their  frailty  they  begat  the  desire  to
please.  He  wanted to merge himself with the pale landscape of her body, to
pass within the circles of her eyes and never depart.</p>
<p>He had lost, he knew. For as the days had vanished about  him,  he  had
weakened.  He  was barely able to scrawl his name upon the receipt proffered
him by the robot who had lumbered toward him, crushing ribcages and cracking
skulls with each terrific step.  Briefly,  he  envied  the  thing.  Sexless,
passionless,  totally  devoted to duty. Before he dismissed it, he asked it,
"What would you do if you had desire and you met with a thing that gave  you
all the things you wished for in the world?"</p>
<p>"I  would--try  to--keep  it,"  it  said, red lights blinking about its
dome, before it turned and lumbered off, across the Great Graveyard.</p>
<p>"Yes," said John Auden aloud, "but this thing cannot be done."</p>
<p>Sythia did not understand  him,  and  on  that  thirty-first  day  they
returned  to  that place where he had lived for a month and he felt the fear
of death, strong, so strong, come upon him.</p>
<p>She was more exquisite that ever  before,  but  he  feared  this  final
encounter.</p>
<p>"I  love  you,"  he  said finally, for it was a thing he had never said
before, and she stroked his brow and kissed it.</p>
<p>"I know," she told him, "and your time is almost at hand,  to  love  me
completely.  Before  the  final act of love, my John Auden, tell me a thing:
What is it that sets you apart? Why is it that you  know  so  much  more  of
things-that-are-not-life  than  mortal  man should know? How was it that you
approached me on that first night without my knowing it?"</p>
<p>"It is because I am already dead," he told her. "Can't you see it  when
you  look  into  my  eyes?  Do  you not feel it, as a certain special chill,
whenever I touch you? I came here rather than sleep the  cold  sleep,  which
would  have  me  to  be  in a thing like death anyhow, an oblivion wherein I
would not even know I was waiting, waiting for the cure  which  might  never
happen,  the  cure  for one of the very last fatal diseases remaining in the
universe, the disease which now leaves me only small time of life."</p>
<p>"I do not understand," she said.</p>
<p>"Kiss me and forget it," he told her. "It is  better  this  way.  There
will  doubtless  never  be a cure, for some things remain always dark, and I
have surely been forgotten. You must have sensed the death upon me,  when  I
restored my humanity, for such is the nature of your kind. I did it to enjoy
you,  knowing  you to be of the Faioli. So have your pleasure of me now, and
know that I share it. I welcome thee. I have courted thee all the days of my
life, unknowing."</p>
<p>But she was curious and asked him (using the  familiar  for  the  first
time),   "How   then  dost  thou  achieve  this  balance  between  life  and
that-which-is-not-life,  this  thing  which  keeps  thee   unconscious   yet
unalive?"</p>
<p>"There  are  controls  set within this body I happen, unfortunately, to
occupy. To touch this place beneath my left armpit will cause  my  lungs  to
cease  their  breathing  and  my heart to stop its beating. It will set into
effect an installed electrochemical system, like those my robots  (invisible
to  you,  I  know)  possess.  This  is  my life within death. I asked for it
because I feared oblivion. I volunteered to be gravekeeper to the  universe,
because  in  this place there are none to look upon me and be repelled by my
deathlike appearance. This is why I am what I am. Kiss me and end it."</p>
<p>But having taken the form of woman, or perhaps being woman  all  along,
the  Faioli  who  was called Sythia was curious, and she said, "This place?"
and she touched the spot beneath his left armpit.</p>
<p>With this he vanished from her sight, and with this also, he knew  once
again  the  icy logic that stood apart from emotion. Because of this, he did
not touch upon the critical spot once again.</p>
<p>Instead, he watched her as she sought for him about the place where  he
had once lived.</p>
<p>She  checked  into  every  closet  and  adytum,  and when she could not
discover a living man, she sobbed once, horribly, as she had on  that  night
when  first  he  had  seen  her. Then the wings flickered, flickered, weakly
flickered, back into existence upon her back, and her face dissolved and her
body slowly melted. The tower of sparks that stood before him then vanished,
and later on that crazy night during which he  could  distinguish  distances
and grasp perspectives once again he began looking for her.</p>
<p>And  that  is  the  story  of John Auden, the only man who ever loved a
Faioli and lived (if you could call it that) to tell of it. No one knows  it
better than I.</p>
<p>No cure has ever been found. And I know that he walks the Canyon of the
Dead and  considers the bones, sometimes stops by the rock where he met her,
blinks after the moist things that are not there, wonders  at  the  judgment
that he gave.</p>
<p>It  is that way, and the moral may be that life (and perhaps love also)
is stronger than that which it contains, but never that which  contains  it.
But  only  a  Faioli  could  tell you for sure, and they never come here any
more.</p>

<p>Carlson stood on the hill in the silent center of the city whose people
had died.</p>
<p>He stared up at the Building--the  one  structure  that  dwarfed  every
hotel-grid,  skyscraper-needle,  or  apartment-cheesebox packed into all the
miles that lay around him. Tall as a mountain, it caught  the  rays  of  the
bloody sun. Somehow it turned their red into golden halfway up its height.</p>
<p>Carlson suddenly felt that he should not have come back.</p>
<p>It  had  been  over two years, as he figured it, since last he had been
here. He wanted to return to the mountains now. One  look  was  enough.  Yet
still  he  stood  before  it,  transfixed  by the huge Building, by the long
shadow that bridged the entire valley. He shrugged his thick shoulders then,
in an unsuccessful attempt to shake off memories of the days, five  (or  was
it six?) years ago, when he had worked within the giant unit.</p>
<p>Then  he  climbed the rest of the way up the hill and entered the high,
wide doorway.</p>
<p>His fiber sandals cast a variety of echoes as  he  passed  through  the
deserted offices and into the long hallway that led to the belts.</p>
<p>The  belts, of course, were still. There were no thousands riding them.
There was no one alive to ride. Their deep belly-rumble  was  only  a  noisy
phantom  in his head as he climbed onto the one nearest him and walked ahead
into the pitchy insides of the place.</p>
<p>It was like a mausoleum. There seemed no ceiling, no  walls,  only  the
soft <emphasis>pat-pat</emphasis> of his soles on the flexible fabric of the belt.</p>
<p>He  reached a junction and mounted a cross-belt, instinctively standing
still for a moment and waiting for  the  forward  lurch  as  it  sensed  his
weight.</p>
<p>Then he chuckled silently and began walking again.</p>
<p>When  he  reached  the  lift,  he  set off to the right of it until his
memory led him to the maintenance stairs. Shouldering his bundle,  he  began
the long, groping ascent.</p>
<p>He  blinked  at  the  light  when he came into the Power Room. Filtered
through its hundred high windows, the sunlight  trickled  across  the  dusty
acres of machinery.</p>
<p>Carlson  sagged  against  the  wall,  breathing heavily from the climb.
After awhile he wiped a workbench clean and set down his parcel.</p>
<p>Then he removed his faded shirt, for the place would soon be  stifling.
He  brushed  his hair from his eyes and advanced down the narrow metal stair
to where the generators stood, row on row,  like  an  army  of  dead,  black
beetles. It took him six hours to give them all a cursory check.</p>
<p>He  selected  three  in the second row and systematically began tearing
them down,  cleaning  them,  soldering  their  loose  connections  with  the
auto-iron,  greasing  them,  oiling  them  and  sweeping  away all the dust,
cobwebs, and pieces of cracked insulation that lay at their bases.</p>
<p>Great rivulets of perspiration ran into his eyes  and  down  along  his
sides  and  thighs,  spilling  in  little droplets onto the hot flooring and
vanishing quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, he put down his broom, remounted the stair and returned to his
parcel. He removed one of the water bottles and drank off half its contents.
He ate a piece of dried meat and finished the bottle. He allowed himself one
cigarette then, and returned to work.</p>
<p>He was forced to stop when it grew dark. He  had  planned  on  sleeping
right  there, but the room was too oppressive. So he departed the way he had
come and slept beneath the stars, on the roof of a low building at the  foot
of the hill.</p>
<p>It  took  him  two more days to get the generators ready. Then he began
work on the huge Broadcast Panel.  It  was  in  better  condition  than  the
generators,  because  it  had  last  been  used  two  years ago. Whereas the
generators, except for the three he had burned out last time, had slept  for
over five (or was it six?) years.</p>
<p>He  soldered  and wiped and inspected until he was satisfied. Then only
one task remained.</p>
<p>All the maintenance robots stood frozen in mid-gesture.  Carlson  would
have  to  wrestle a three hundred pound power cube without assistance. If he
could get one down from the rack and onto a cart without breaking a wrist he
would probably be able to convey it to the Igniter without much  difficulty.
Then  he  would  have  to  place  it within the oven. He had almost ruptured
himself when he did it two years ago, but he  hoped  that  he  was  somewhat
stronger--and luckier--this time.</p>
<p>It  took  him  ten minutes to clean the Igniter oven. Then he located a
cart and pushed it back to the rack.</p>
<p>One cube resting at just the right height, approximately  eight  inches
above  the  level  of  the  cart's bed. He kicked down the anchor chocks and
moved around to study the rack. The cube lay on a  downward-slanting  shelf,
restrained  by a two-inch metal guard. He pushed at the guard. It was bolted
to the shelf.</p>
<p>Returning to the work area, he searched the tool boxes  for  a  wrench.
Then he moved back to the rack and set to work on the nuts.</p>
<p>The  guard  came  loose as he was working on the fourth nut. He heard a
dangerous creak and threw himself back out of the way, dropping  the  wrench
on his toes.</p>
<p>The  cube  slid  forward,  crushed  the  loosened rail, teetered a bare
moment, then dropped with a resounding crash onto the heavy bed of the cart.
The bed surface bent and began to crease beneath its weight; the cart swayed
toward the outside. The cube continued to  slide  until  over  half  a  foot
projected  beyond  the  edge. Then the cart righted itself and shivered into
steadiness.</p>
<p>Carlson sighed and kicked loose the chocks, ready to jump  back  should
it suddenly give way in his direction. It held.</p>
<p>Gingerly, he guided it up the aisle and between the rows of generators,
until  he  stood before the Igniter. He anchored the cart again, stopped for
water and a cigarette, then searched up a pinch bar,  a  small  jack  and  a
long, flat metal plate.</p>
<p>He  laid  the plate to bridge the front end of the cart and the opening
to the oven. He wedged the far end in beneath the Igniter's doorframe.</p>
<p>Unlocking the rear chocks, he inserted the jack and began to raise  the
back  end  of  the  wagon, slowly, working with one hand and holding the bar
ready in his other.</p>
<p>The cart groaned as it moved higher.  Then  a  sliding,  grating  sound
began and he raised it faster.</p>
<p>With  a  sound  like the stroke of a cracked bell the cube tumbled onto
the bridgeway; it slid forward and to the left. He struck  at  it  with  the
bar,  bearing  to  the right with all his strength. About half an inch of it
caught against the left edge of the oven frame. The gap between the cube and
the frame was widest at the bottom.</p>
<p>He inserted the bar and heaved his weight against it--three times.</p>
<p>Then it moved forward and came to rest within the Igniter.</p>
<p>He began to laugh. He laughed until he felt weak. He sat on the  broken
cart,  swinging  his  legs and chuckling to himself, until the sounds coming
from his throat seemed alien and out  of  place.  He  stopped  abruptly  and
slammed the door.</p>
<p>The  Broadcast  Panel had a thousand eyes, but none of them winked back
at him. He made the final adjustments for Transmit, then gave the generators
their last check-out.</p>
<p>There was still some daylight to spend, so  he  moved  from  window  to
window pressing the "Open" button set below each sill.</p>
<p>He ate the rest of his food then, and drank a whole bottle of water and
smoked  two cigarettes. Sitting on the stair, he thought of the days when he
had worked with Kelly and Murchison  and  Djinsky,  twisting  the  tails  of
electrons  until they wailed and leapt out over the walls and fled down into
the city.</p>
<p>The clock! He remembered it suddenly--set high on the wall, to the left
of the doorway, frozen at 9:33 (and forty-eight seconds).</p>
<p>He moved a ladder through the twilight and mounted it to the clock.  He
wiped the dust away from its greasy face with a sweeping, circular movement.
Then he was ready.</p>
<p>He   crossed   to   the   Igniter  and  turned  it  on.  Somewhere  the
ever-batteries came alive, and he heard a click as a thin, sharp  shaft  was
driven  into  the  wall  of  the  cube. He raced back up the stairs and sped
hand-over-hand up to the catwalk. He moved to a window and waited.</p>
<p>"God," he muttered, "don't let them blow! Please don't--"</p>
<p>Across an eternity of darkness the generators began humming. He heard a
crackle of static from the Broadcast Panel and he closed his eyes. The sound
died.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes as he heard the window slide upward. All around  him
the  hundred  high  windows opened. A small light came on above the bench in
the work area below him, but he did not see it.</p>
<p>He was staring out beyond the wide drop of the acropolis and down  into
the city. His city.</p>
<p>The  lights  were  not like the stars. They beat the stars all to hell.
They were the gay, regularized constellation of a city where men made  their
homes:  even  rows  of  streetlamps,  advertisements, lighted windows in the
cheesebox-apartments, a random solitaire of bright squares  running  up  the
sides  of  skyscraper-needles, a searchlight swivelling its luminous antenna
through cloudbanks that hung over the city.</p>
<p>He dashed to another window, feeling the high night breezes comb at his
beard. Belts were humming below; he  heard  their  wry  monologues  rattling
through  the  city's deepest canyons. He pictured the people in their homes,
in theaters, in bars--talking to each other,  sharing  a  common  amusement,
playing  clarinets, holding hands, eating an evening snack. Sleeping ro-cars
awakened and rushed past each other on  the  levels  above  the  belts;  the
background hum of the city told him its story of production, of function, of
movement  and  service to its inhabitants. The sky seemed to wheel overhead,
as though the city were its turning hub and the universe its outer rim.</p>
<p>Then the lights dimmed from  white  to  yellow  and  he  hurried,  with
desperate steps, to another window.</p>
<p>"No!  Not so soon!  Don't leave me yet!" he sobbed.</p>
<p>The  windows closed themselves and the lights went out. He stood on the
walk for a long time, staring at the dead embers. A smell of  ozone  reached
his nostrils. He was aware of a blue halo about the dying generators.</p>
<p>He descended and crossed the work area to the ladder he had set against
the wall.</p>
<p>Pressing  his  face  against the glass and squinting for a long time he
could make out the position of the hands.</p>
<p>"Nine thirty-five, and twenty-one seconds," Carlson read.</p>
<p>"Do you hear that?" he  called  out,  shaking  his  fist  at  anything.
"Ninety-three seconds! I made you live for ninety-three seconds!"</p>
<p>Then he covered his face against the darkness and was silent.</p>
<p>After  a  long  while  he  descended the stairway, walked the belt, and
moved through the long hallway and out of the Building. As  he  headed  back
toward the mountains he promised himself--again--that he would never return.</p>
