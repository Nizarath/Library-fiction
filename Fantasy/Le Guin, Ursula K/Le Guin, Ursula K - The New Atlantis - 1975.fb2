<p>COMING BACK FROM my Wilderness Week I sat by an odd sort of man in the bus. For a long time 
we didn't talk; I was mending stockings and he was reading. Then the bus broke down a few miles 
outside Gresham. Boiler trouble, the way it generally is when the driver insists on trying to go over thirty. 
It was a Supersonic Superscenic Deluxe long distance coal-burner, with Home Comfort, that means a 
toilet, and the seats were pretty comfortable, at least those that hadn't yet worked loose from their bolts, 
so everybody waited inside the bus; besides, it was raining. We began talking, the way people do when 
there's a breakdown and a wait. He held up his pamphlet and tapped it—he was a dry-looking man with 
a school-teacherish way of using his hands—and said, "This is interesting. I've been reading that a new 
continent is rising from the depths of the sea."</p>
<p>The blue stockings were hopeless. You have to have something besides holes to darn onto. "Which sea?"</p>
<p>"They're not sure yet. Most specialists think the Atlantic. But there's evidence it may be happening in the 
Pacific, too."</p>
<p>"Won't the oceans get a little crowded?" I said, not taking it seriously. I was a bit snappish, because of 
the breakdown and because those blue stockings had been good warm ones.</p>
<p>He tapped the pamphlet again and shook his head, quite serious. "No," he said. "The old continents are 
sinking, to make room for the new. You can see that that is happening."</p>
<p>You certainly can. Manhattan Island is now under eleven feet of water at low tide, and there are oyster 
beds in Ghirardelli Square.</p>
<p>"I thought that was because the oceans are rising from polar melt."</p>
<p>He shook his head again. "That is a factor. Due to the greenhouse effect of pollution, indeed Antarctica 
may become inhabitable. But climatic factors will not explain the emergence of the new—or, possibly, 
very old—continents in the Atlantic and Pacific." He went on explaining about continental drift, but I liked 
the idea of inhabiting Antarctica and daydreamed about it for a while. I thought of it as very empty, very 
quiet, all white and blue, with a faint golden glow northward from the unrising sun behind the long peak of 
Mount Erebus. There were a few people there; they were very quiet too, and wore white tie and tails. 
Some of them carried oboes and violas. Southward the white land went up in a long silence toward the 
Pole.</p>
<p>Just the opposite, in fact, of the Mount Hood Wilderness Area. It had been a tiresome vacation. The 
other women in the dormitory were all right, but it was macaroni for breakfast, and there were so many 
organized sports. I had looked forward to the hike up to the National Forest Preserve, the largest forest 
left in the United States, but the trees didn't look at all the way they do in the postcards and brochures 
and Federal Beautification Bureau advertisements. They were spindly, and they all had little signs on 
saying which union they had been planted by. There were actually a lot more green picnic tables and 
cement Men's and Women's than there were trees. There was an electrified fence all around the forest to 
keep out unauthorized persons. The forest ranger talked about mountain jays, "bold little robbers," he 
said, "who will come and snatch the sandwich from your very hand," but I didn't see any. Perhaps 
because that was the weekly Watch Those Surplus Calories! Day for all the women, and so we didn't 
have any sandwiches. If I'd seen a mountain jay, I might have snatched the sandwich from his very hand, 
who knows. Anyhow it was an exhausting week, and I wished I'd stayed home and practiced, even 
though I'd have lost a week's pay because staying home and practicing the viola doesn't count as planned 
implementation of recreational leisure as defined by the Federal Union of Unions.</p>

implementation of recreational leisure as defined by the Federal Union of Unions.</p>
<p>Then we had to get out and walk on into Gresham, because they had decided that the best thing for us all 
to do was get onto the Greater Portland Area Rapid Public Transit Lines, since there had been so many 
breakdowns that the charter bus company didn't have any more buses to send out to pick us up. The 
walk was wet, and rather dull, except when we passed the Cold Mountain Commune. They have a wall 
around it to keep out unauthorized persons, and a big neon sign out front saying COLD MOUNTAIN 
COMMUNE, and there were some people in authentic jeans and ponchos by the highway selling 
macrame belts and sandcast candles and soybean bread to the tourists. In Gresham, I took the 4:40 
GPARPTL Superjet Flyer train to Burnside and East 230th, and then walked to 217th and got the bus to 
the Goldschmidt Overpass, and transferred to the shuttlebus, but it had boiler trouble, so I didn't reach 
the downtown transfer point until ten after eight, and the buses go on a once-an-hour schedule at eight, 
so I got a meatless hamburger at the Longhorn Inch-Thick Steak House Dinerette and caught the nine 
o'clock bus and got home about ten. When I let myself into the apartment I flipped the switch to turn on 
the lights, but there still weren't any. There had been a power outage in West Portland for three weeks. 
So I went feeling about for the candles in the dark, and it was a minute or so before I noticed that 
somebody was lying on my bed.</p>
<p>I panicked, and tried to turn the lights on.</p>
<p>It was a man, lying there in a long thin heap. I thought a burglar had got in somehow while I was away 
and died. I opened the door so I could get out quick or at least my yells could be heard, and then I 
managed not to shake long enough to strike a match, and lighted the candle, and came a little closer to 
the bed.</p>
<p>The light disturbed him. He made a sort of snorting in his throat and turned his head. I saw it was a 
stranger, but I knew his eyebrows, then the breadth of his closed eyelids, then I saw my husband.</p>
<p>He woke up while I was standing there over him with the candle in my hand. He laughed and said, still 
half asleep, "Ah, Psyche! From the regions which are holy land."</p>
<p>Neither of us made much fuss. It was unexpected, but it did seem so natural for him to be there, after all, 
much more natural than for him not to be there, and he was too tired to be very emotional. We lay there 
together in the dark, and he explained that they had released him from the Rehabilitation Camp early 
because he had injured his back in an accident in the gravel quarry, and they were afraid it might get 
worse. If he died there it wouldn't be good publicity abroad, since there have been some nasty rumors 
about deaths from illness in the Rehabilitation Camps and the Federal Medical Association Hospitals; and 
there are scientists abroad who have heard of Simon, since somebody published his proof of Goldbach's 
Hypothesis in Peking. So they let him out early, with eight dollars in his pocket, which is what he had in 
his pocket when they arrested him, which made it, of course, fair. He had walked and hitched home from 
Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, with a couple of days in jail in Walla Walla for being caught hitchhiking. He 
almost fell asleep telling me this, and when he had told me, he did fall asleep. He needed a change of 
clothes and a bath but I didn't want to wake him. Besides, I was tired, too. We lay side by side and his 
head was on my arm. I don't suppose that I have ever been so happy. No; was it happiness? Something 
wider and darker, more like knowledge, more like the night: joy.</p>

wider and darker, more like knowledge, more like the night: joy.</p>
<p>It was dark for so long, so very long. We were all blind. And there was the cold, a vast, unmoving, 
heavy cold. We could not move at all. We did not move. We did not speak. Our mouths were 
closed, pressed shut by the cold and by the weight. Our eyes were pressed shut. Our limbs were 
held still. Our minds were held still. For how long? There was no length of time; how long is 
death? And is one dead only after living, or before life as well? Certainly we thought, if we 
thought anything, that we were dead; but if we had ever been alive, we had forgotten it.</p>
<p>There was a change. It must have been the pressure that changed first, although we did not know 
it. The eyelids are sensitive to touch. They must have been weary of being shut. When the pressure 
upon them weakened a little, they opened. But there was no way for us to know that. It was too 
cold for us to feel anything. There was nothing to be seen. There was black.</p>
<p>But then—"then," for the event created time, created before and after, near and far, now and 
then—"then" there was the light. One light. One small, strange light that passed slowly, at what 
distance we could not tell. A small greenish white, slightly blurred point of radiance, passing.</p>
<p>Our eyes were certainly open, "then," for we saw it. We saw the moment. The moment is a point 
of light. Whether in darkness or in the field of all light, the moment is small, and moves, but not 
quickly. And "then" it is gone.</p>
<p>It did not occur to us that there might be another moment. There was no reason to assume that 
there might be more than one. One was marvel enough: that in all the field of the dark, in the 
cold, heavy, dense, moveless, timeless, placeless, boundless black, there would have occurred, 
once, a small, slightly blurred, moving light! Time need be created only once, we thought.</p>
<p>But we were mistaken. The difference between one and more than one is all the difference in the 
world. Indeed, that difference is the world.</p>
<p>The light returned.</p>
<p>The same light, or another one? There was no telling.</p>
<p>But, "this time," we wondered about the light: Was it small and near to us, or large and far away? 
Again there was no telling; but there was something about the way it moved, a trace of hesitation, 
a tentative quality, that did not seem proper to anything large and remote. The stars, for instance. 
We began to remember the stars.</p>
<p>The stars had never hesitated.</p>
<p>Perhaps the noble certainty of their gait had been a mere effect of distance. Perhaps in fact they 
had hurtled wildly, enormous furnace-fragments of a primal bomb thrown through the cosmic 
dark; but time and distance soften all agony. If the universe, as seems likely, began with an act of 
destruction, the stars we had used to see told no tales of it. They had been implacably serene.</p>
<p>The planets, however … We began to remember the planets. They had suffered certain changes 
both of appearance and of course. At certain times of the year Mars would reverse its direction 
and go backward through the stars. Venus had been brighter and less bright as she went through 
her phases of crescent, full, and wane. Mercury had shuddered like a skidding drop of rain on the 
sky flushed with daybreak. The light we now watched had that erratic, trembling quality. We saw 
it, unmistakably, change direction and go backward. It then grew smaller and fainter; blinked— 
an eclipse?—and slowly disappeared.</p>

<p>Then—the third "then"!—arrived, the indubitable and positive Wonder of the World, the Magic 
Trick, watch now, watch, you will not believe your eyes, mama, mama, look what I can do—</p>
<p>Seven lights in a row, proceeding fairly rapidly, with a darting movement, from left to right. 
Proceeding less rapidly from right to left, two dimmer, greenish lights. Two lights halt, blink, 
reverse course, proceed hastily and in a wavering manner from left to right. Seven-lights increase 
speed, and catch up. Two-lights flash desperately, flicker, and are gone.</p>
<p>Seven-lights hang still for some while, then merge gradually into one streak, veering away, and 
little by little vanish into the immensity of the dark.</p>
<p>But in the dark now are growing other lights, many of them: lamps, dots, rows, scintillations—s 
ome near at hand, some far. Like the stars, yes, but not stars. It is not the great Existences we are 
seeing, but only the little lives.</p>

<p>In the morning Simon told me something about the Camp, but not until after he had had me check the 
apartment for bugs. I thought at first he had been given behavior mod and gone paranoid. We never had 
been infested. And I'd been living alone for a year and a half; surely they didn't want to hear me talking to 
myself? But he said, "They may have been expecting me to come here."</p>
<p>"But they let you go free!"</p>
<p>He just lay there and laughed at me. So I checked everywhere we could think of. I didn't find any bugs, 
but it did look as if somebody had gone through the bureau drawers while I was away in the Wilderness. 
Simon's papers were all at Max's, so that didn't matter. I made tea on the Primus, and washed and 
shaved Simon with the extra hot water in the kettle—he had a thick beard and wanted to get rid of it 
because of the lice he had brought from Camp—and while we were doing that he told me about the 
Camp. In fact he told me very little, but not much was necessary.</p>
<p>He had lost about 20 pounds. As he only weighed 140 to start with, this left little to go on with. His 
knees and wrist bones stuck out like rocks under the skin. His feet were all swollen and chewed-looking 
from the Camp boots; he hadn't dared take the boots off, the last three days of walking, because he was 
afraid he wouldn't be able to get them back on. When he had to move or sit up so I could wash him, he 
shut his eyes.</p>
<p>"Am I really here?" he asked. "Am I here?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said. "You are here. What I don't understand is how you got here."</p>
<p>"Oh, it wasn't bad so long as I kept moving. All you need is to know where you're going—to have 
someplace to go. You know, some of the people in Camp, if they'd let them go, they wouldn't have had 
that. They couldn't have gone anywhere. Keeping moving was the main thing. See, my back's all seized 
up, now."</p>
<p>that. They couldn't have gone anywhere. Keeping moving was the main thing. See, my back's all seized 
up, now."</p>
<p>It was strange, and it is strange, to be thinking about "him," the man I have known for ten years, the same 
man, while "he" lay there changed out of recognition, a different man. It is enough to make you 
understand why most languages have a word like "soul." There are various degrees of death, and time 
spares us none of them. Yet something endures, for which a word is needed.</p>
<p>I said what I had not been able to say for a year and a half: "I was afraid they'd brainwash you."</p>
<p>He said, "Behavior mod is expensive. Even just the drugs. They save it mostly for the VIPs. But I'm 
afraid they got a notion I might be important after all. I got questioned a lot the last couple of months. 
About my 'foreign contacts.'" He snorted. "The stuff that got published abroad, I suppose. So I want to 
be careful and make sure it's just a Camp again next time, and not a Federal Hospital."</p>
<p>"Simon, were they… are they cruel, or just righteous?"</p>
<p>He did not answer for a while. He did not want to answer. He knew what I was asking. He knew by 
what thread hangs hope, the sword, above our heads.</p>
<p>"Some of them…" he said at last, mumbling.</p>
<p>Some of them had been cruel. Some of them had enjoyed their work. You cannot blame everything on 
society.</p>
<p>"Prisoners, as well as guards," he said.</p>
<p>You cannot blame everything on the enemy.</p>
<p>"Some of them, Belle," he said with energy, touching my hand— "some of them, there were men like gold 
there—"</p>
<p>The thread is tough; you cannot cut it with one stroke.</p>
<p>"What have you been playing?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Forrest, Schubert."</p>
<p>"With the quartet?"</p>
<p>"Trio, now. Janet went to Oakland with a new lover."</p>
<p>"Ah, poor Max."</p>
<p>"It's just as well, really. She isn't a good pianist."</p>
<p>I make Simon laugh too, though I don't intend to. We talked until it was past time for me to go to work. 
My shift since the Full Employment Act last year is ten to two. I am an inspector in a recycled paper bag 
factory. I have never rejected a bag yet; the electronic inspector catches all the defective ones first. It is a 
rather depressing job. But it's only four hours a day, and it takes more time than that to go through all the 
lines and physical and mental examinations, and fill out all the forms, and talk to all the welfare counselors 
and inspectors every week in order to qualify as Unemployed, and then line up every day for the ration 
stamps and the dole. Simon thought I ought to go to work as usual. I tried to, but I couldn't. He had felt 
very hot to the touch when I</p>

very hot to the touch when I</p>
<p>The doctor was willing to come at once, so we rode home on the bus together. She gathered very soon 
that Simon and I were married, and it was funny to see her look at us and smile like a cat. Some people 
love illegality for its own sake. Men, more often than women. It's men who make laws, and enforce them, 
and break them, and think the whole performance is wonderful. Most women would rather just ignore 
them. You could see that this woman, like a man, actually enjoyed breaking them. That may have been 
what put her into an illegal business in the first place, a preference for the shady side. But there was more 
to it than that. No doubt she'd wanted to be a doctor too; and the Federal Medical Association doesn't 
admit women into the medical schools. She probably got her training as some other doctor's private 
pupil, under the counter. Very much as Simon learned mathematics, since the universities don't teach 
much but Business Administration and Advertising and Media Skills anymore. However she learned it, 
she seemed to know her stuff. She fixed up a kind of homemade traction device for Simon very handily 
and informed him that if he did much more walking for two months he'd be crippled the rest of his life, but 
if he behaved himself he'd just be more or less lame. It isn't the kind of thing you'd expect to be grateful 
for being told, but we both were. Leaving, she gave me a bottle of about two hundred plain white pills, 
unlabeled. "Aspirin," she said. "He'll be in a good deal of pain off and on for weeks."</p>
<p>I looked at the bottle. I had never seen aspirin before, only the Super-Buffered Pane-Gon and the 
Triple-Power N-L-G-Zic and the Extra-Strength Apansprin with the miracle ingredient more doctors 
recommend, which the fed-meds always give you prescriptions for, to be filled at your FMA-approved 
private enterprise friendly drugstore at the low, low prices established by the Pure Food and Drug 
Administration in order to inspire competitive research.</p>
<p>"Aspirin," the doctor repeated. "The miracle ingredient more doctors recommend." She cat-grinned 
again. I think she liked us because we were living in sin. That bottle of black-market aspirin was probably 
worth more than the old Navajo bracelet I pawned for her fee.</p>
<p>I went out again to register Simon as temporarily domiciled at my address and to apply for Temporary 
Unemployment Compensation ration stamps for him. They only give them to you for two weeks and you 
have to come every day; but to register him as Temporarily Disabled meant getting the signatures of two 
fed-meds, and I thought I'd rather put that off for a while. It took three hours to go through the lines and 
get the forms he would have to fill out, and to answer the 'crats' questions about why he wasn't there in 
person. They smelled something fishy. Of course it's hard for them to prove that two people are married 
and aren't just adultering if you move now and then and your friends help out by sometimes registering 
one of you as living at their address; but they had all the back files on both of us and it was obvious that 
we had been around each other for a suspiciously long time. The State really does make things awfully 
hard for itself. It must have been simpler to enforce the laws back when marriage was legal and adultery 
was what got you into trouble. They only had to catch you once. But I'll bet people broke the law just as 
often then as they do now.</p>

<p>The lantern-creatures came close enough at last that we could see not only their light, but their 
bodies in the illumination of their light. They were not pretty. They were dark colored, most often 
a dark red, and they were all mouth. They ate one another whole. Light swallowed light all 
swallowed together in the vaster mouth of the darkness. They moved slowly, for nothing, however 
small and hungry, could move fast under that weight, in that cold. Their eyes, round with fear, 
were never closed. Their bodies were tiny and bony behind the gaping jaws. They wore queer, ugly 
decorations on their lips and skulls: fringes, serrated wattles, feather-like fronds, gauds, bangles, 
lures. Poor little sheep of the deep pastures! Poor ragged, hunchjawed dwarfs squeezed to the 
bone by the weight of the darkness, chilled to the bone by the cold of the darkness, tiny monsters 
burning with bright hunger, who brought us back to life!</p>
<p>Occasionally, in the wan, sparse illumination of one of the lantern-creatures, we caught a 
momentary glimpse of other, large, unmoving shapes: the barest suggestion, off in the distance, 
not of a wall, nothing so solid and certain as a wall, but of a surface, an angle… Was it there?</p>
<p>Or something would glitter, faint, far off, far down. There was no use trying to make out what it 
might be. Probably it was only a fleck of sediment, mud, or mica, disturbed by a struggle between 
the lantern-creatures, flickering like a bit of diamond dust as it rose and settled slowly. In any 
case, we could not move to go see what it was. We had not even the cold, narrow freedom of the 
lantern-creatures. We were immobilized, borne down, still shadows among the half-guessed 
shadow walls. Were we there?</p>
<p>The lantern-creatures showed no awareness of us. They passed before</p>
<p>us, among us, perhaps even through us—it was impossible to be sure. They were not afraid, or 
curious.</p>
<p>Once something a little larger than a hand came crawling near, and for a moment we saw quite 
distinctly the clean angle where the foot of a wall rose from the pavement, in the glow cast by the 
crawling creature, which was covered with a foliage of plumes, each plume dotted with many tiny, 
bluish points of light. We saw the pavement beneath the creature and the wall beside it, 
heartbreaking in its exact, clear linearity, its opposition to all that was fluid, random, vast, and 
void. We saw the creature's claws, slowly reaching out and retracting like small stiff fingers, touch 
the wall. Its plumage of light quivering, it dragged itself along and vanished behind the corner of 
the wall.</p>
<p>So we knew that the wall was there; and that it was an outer wall, a housefront, perhaps, or the 
side of one of the towers of the city.</p>
<p>We remembered the towers. We remembered the city. We had forgotten it. We had forgotten who 
we were; but we remembered the city, now.</p>

<p>When I got home, the FBI had already been there. The computer at the police precinct where I 
registered Simon's address must have flashed it right over to the computer at the FBI building. They had 
questioned Simon for about an hour, mostly about what he had been doing during the twelve days it took 
him to get from the Camp to Portland. I suppose they thought he had flown to Peking or something. 
Having a police record in Walla Walla for hitchhiking helped him establish his story. He told me that one 
of them had gone to the bathroom. Sure enough I found a bug stuck on the top of the bathroom door 
frame. I left it, as we figured it's really better to leave it when you know you have one, than to take it off 
and then never be sure they haven't planted another one you don't know about. As Simon said, if we felt 
we had to say something unpatriotic we could always flush the toilet at the same time.</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>
<p>"I didn't hear," Simon said, lying with his eyes shut and his face pale and sweaty. I gave him two aspirins 
before we ate. He ate little, and fell asleep while I was washing the dishes in the bathroom. I had been 
going to practice, but a viola is fairly wakeful in a one-room apartment. I read for a while instead. It was 
a best seller Janet had given me when she left. She thought it was very good, but then she likes Franz 
Liszt too. I don't read much since the libraries were closed down, it's too hard to get books; all you can 
buy is best sellers. I don't remember the title of this one; the cover just said "Ninety Million Copies in 
Print!!!" It was about small-town sex life in the last century, the dear old 1970s when there weren't any 
problems and life was so simple and nostalgic. The author squeezed all the naughty thrills he could out of 
the fact that all the main characters were married. I looked at the end and saw that all the married 
couples shot each other after all their children became schizophrenic hookers, except for one brave pair 
that divorced and then leapt into bed together with a clear-eyed pair of government-employed lovers for 
eight pages of healthy group sex as a brighter future dawned. I went to bed then, too. Simon was hot, but 
sleeping quietly. His breathing was like the sound of soft waves far away, and I went out to the dark sea 
on the sound of them.</p>
<p>I used to go out to the dark sea, often, as a child, falling asleep. I had almost forgotten it with my waking 
mind. As a child all I had to do was stretch out and think, "the dark sea… the dark sea…" and soon 
enough I'd be there, in the great depths, rocking. But after I grew up it only happened rarely, as a great 
gift. To know the abyss of the darkness and not to fear it, to entrust oneself to it and whatever may arise 
from it—what greater gift?</p>

<p>We watched the tiny lights come and go around us, and doing so, we gained a sense of space and 
of direction—near and far, at least, and higher and lower. It was that sense of space that allowed 
us to become aware of the currents. Space was no longer entirely still around us, suppressed by 
the enormous pressure of its own weight. Very dimly we were aware that the cold darkness 
moved, slowly, softly, pressing against us a little for a long time, then ceasing, in a vast 
oscillation. The empty darkness flowed slowly along our unmoving unseen bodies, along them, 
past them, perhaps through them; we could not tell.</p>
<p>We watched the tiny lights come and go around us, and doing so, we gained a sense of space and 
of direction—near and far, at least, and higher and lower. It was that sense of space that allowed 
us to become aware of the currents. Space was no longer entirely still around us, suppressed by 
the enormous pressure of its own weight. Very dimly we were aware that the cold darkness 
moved, slowly, softly, pressing against us a little for a long time, then ceasing, in a vast 
oscillation. The empty darkness flowed slowly along our unmoving unseen bodies, along them, 
past them, perhaps through them; we could not tell.</p>
<p>So our sense of space sharpened and localized to a sense of place. For sound is local, as sight is 
not. Sound is delimited by silence; and it does not rise out of the silence unless it is fairly close, 
both in space and in time. Though we stand where once the singer stood we cannot hear the voice 
singing; the years have carried it off on their tides, submerged it. Sound is a fragile thing, a 
tremor, as delicate as life itself. We may see the stars, but we cannot hear them. Even were the 
hollowness of outer space an atmosphere, an ether that transmitted the waves of sound, we could 
not hear the stars; they are too far away. At most, if we listened we might hear our own sun, all 
the mighty, roiling, exploding storm of its burning, as a whisper at the edge of hearing.</p>
<p>A sea wave laps one's feet: It is the shock wave of a volcanic eruption on the far side of the world. 
But one hears nothing.</p>
<p>A red light flickers on the horizon: It is the reflection in smoke of a city on the distant mainland, 
burning. But one hears nothing.</p>
<p>Only on the slopes of the volcano, in the suburbs of the city, does one begin to hear the deep 
thunder, and the high voices crying.</p>
<p>Thus, when we became aware that we were hearing, we were sure that the sounds we heard were 
fairly close to us. And yet we may have been quite wrong. For we were in a strange place, a deep 
place. Sound travels fast and far in the deep places, and the silence there is perfect, letting the 
least noise be heard for hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>And these were not small noises. The lights were tiny, but the sounds were vast: not loud, but very 
large. Often they were below the range of hearing, long slow vibrations rather than sounds. The 
first we heard seemed to us to rise up through the currents from beneath us: immense</p>
<p>groans, sighs felt along the bone, a rumbling, a deep uneasy whispering.</p>
<p>Later, certain sounds came down to us from above, or borne along the endless levels of the 
darkness, and these were stranger yet, for they were music. A huge, calling, yearning music from 
far away in the darkness, calling not to us. Where are you? I am here.</p>
<p>Not to us.</p>
<p>They were the voices of the great souls, the great lives, the lonely ones, the voyagers. Calling. Not 
often answered. Where are you? Where have you gone?</p>
<p>But the bones, the keels and girders of white bones on icy isles of the South, the shores of bones 
did not reply.</p>
<p>did not reply.</p>
<p>I am here. Where have you gone?</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>Only the whispering thunder from below.</p>
<p>But we knew now, though we could not answer, we knew because we heard, because we felt, 
because we wept, we knew that we were; and we remembered other voices.</p>

<p>Max came the next night. I sat on the toilet lid to practice, with the bathroom door shut. The FBI men on 
the other end of the bug got a solid half-hour of scales and doublestops, and then a quite good 
performance of the Hindemith unaccompanied viola sonata. The bathroom being very small and all hard 
surfaces, the noise I made was really tremendous. Not a good sound, far too much echo, but the sheer 
volume was contagious, and I played louder as I went on. The man up above knocked on his floor once; 
but if I have to listen to the weekly Ail-American Olympic Games at full blast every Sunday morning from 
his TV set, then he has to accept Paul Hindemith coming up out of his toilet now and then.</p>
<p>When I got tired, I put a wad of cotton over the bug and came out of the bathroom half-deaf. Simon and 
Max were on fire. Burning, un-consumed. Simon was scribbling formulae in traction, and Max was 
pumping his elbows up and down the way he does, like a boxer, and saying, "The e-lec-tron 
emis-sion…" through his nose, with his eyes narrowed, and his mind evidently going light-years per 
second faster than his tongue, because he kept beginning over and saying "The e-lec-tron emis-sion…" 
and pumping his elbows.</p>
<p>Intellectuals at work are very strange to look at. As strange as artists. I never could understand how an 
audience can sit there and look at a fiddler rolling his eyes and biting his tongue, or a horn player 
collect-ing spit, or a pianist like a black cat strapped to an electrified bench, as if what they saw had 
anything to do with the music.</p>
<p>I damped the fires with a quart of black-market beer—the legal kind is better, but I never have enough 
ration stamps for beer; I'm not thirsty enough to go without eating—and gradually Max and Simon 
cooled down. Max would have stayed talking all night, but I drove him out because Simon was looking 
tired.</p>
<p>I put a new battery in the radio and left it playing in the bathroom, and blew out the candle and lay and 
talked with Simon; he was too excited to sleep. He said that Max had solved the problems that were 
bothering them before Simon was sent to Camp, and had fitted Simon's equations to (as Simon put it) the 
bare facts, which means they have achieved "direct energy conversion." Ten or twelve people have 
worked on it at different times since Simon published the theoretical part of it when he was twenty-two. 
The physicist Ann Jones had pointed out right away that the simplest practical application of the theory 
would be to build a "sun tap," a device for collecting and storing solar energy, only much cheaper and 
better than the USG Sola-Heetas that some rich people have on their houses. And it would have been 
simple only they kept hitting the same snag. Now Max has got around the snag.</p>
<p>I said that Simon published the theory, but that is inaccurate. Of course he's never been able to publish 
any of his papers in print; he's not a federal employee and doesn't have a government clearance. But it 
did get circulated in what the scientists and poets call Sammy's-dot, that is, just handwritten or 
hectographed. It's an old joke that the FBI arrests everybody with purple fingers, because they have 
either been hectographing Sammy's-dots, or they have impetigo.</p>

either been hectographing Sammy's-dots, or they have impetigo.</p>
<p>I asked him to explain what the sun tap would mean to the masses, with me as a representative mass. He 
explained that it means we can tap solar energy for power, using a device that's easier to build than a jar 
battery. The efficiency and storage capacity are such that about ten minutes of sunlight will power an 
apartment complex like ours, heat and lights and elevators and all, for twenty-four hours; and no 
pollution, particulate, thermal, or radioactive. "There isn't any danger of using up the sun?" I asked. He 
took it soberly—it was a stupid question, but after all not so long ago people thought there wasn't any 
danger of using up the earth—and said no, because we wouldn't be pulling out energy, as we did when 
we mined and lumbered and split atoms, but just using the energy that comes to us anyhow, as the plants, 
the trees and grass and rosebushes always have done. "You could call it Flower Power," he said. He was 
high, high up on the mountain, ski-jumping in the sunlight.</p>
<p>"The State owns us," he said, "because the corporative State has a monopoly on power sources, and 
there's not enough power to go around. But now, anybody could build a generator on their roof that 
would furnish enough power to light a city."</p>
<p>I looked out the window at the dark city.</p>
<p>"We could completely decentralize industry and agriculture. Technology could serve life instead of serving 
capital. We could each run our own life. Power is power!… The State is a machine. We could unplug 
the machine, now. Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. But that's true only when there's 
a price on power. When groups can keep the power to themselves; when they can use physical 
power-to in order to exert spiritual power-over; when might makes right. But if power is free? If 
everybody is equally mighty? Then everybody's got to find a better way of showing that he's right…"</p>
<p>"That's what Mr. Nobel thought when he invented dynamite," I said. "Peace on earth."</p>
<p>He slid down the sunlit slope a couple of thousand feet and stopped beside me in a spray of snow, 
smiling. "Skull at the banquet," he said, "finger writing on the wall. Be still! Look, don't you see the sun 
shining on the Pentagon, all the roofs are off, the sun shines at last into the corridors of power… And 
they shrivel up, they wither away. The green grass grows through the carpets of the Oval Room, the Hot 
Line is disconnected for nonpayment of the bill. The first thing we'll do is build an electrified fence outside 
the electrified fence around the White House. The inner one prevents unauthorized persons from getting 
in. The outer one will prevent authorized persons from getting out…"</p>
<p>Of course he was bitter. Not many people come out of prison sweet.</p>
<p>But it was cruel, to be shown this great hope, and to know that there was no hope for it. He did know 
that. He knew it right along. He knew that there was no mountain, that he was skiing on the wind.</p>

<p>The tiny lights of the lantern-creatures died out one by one, sank away. The distant lonely voices 
were silent. The cold, slow currents flowed, vacant, only shaken from time to time by a shifting in 
the abyss.</p>
<p>It was dark again, and no voice spoke. All dark, dumb, cold.</p>
<p>It was dark again, and no voice spoke. All dark, dumb, cold.</p>
<p>It was not like the dawns we had begun to remember: the change, manifold and subtle, in the 
smell and touch of the air; the hush that, instead of sleeping, wakes, holds still, and waits; the 
appearance of objects, looking gray, vague, and new, as if just created—distant mountains</p>
<p>against the eastern sky, one's own hands, the hoary grass full of dew and shadow, the fold in the 
edge of a curtain hanging by the window—and then, before one is quite sure that one is indeed 
seeing again, that the light has returned, that day is breaking, the first, abrupt, sweet stammer of 
a waking bird. And after that the chorus, voice by voice: This is my nest, this is my tree, this is my 
egg, this is my day, this is my life, here I am, here I am, hurray for me! I'm here!—No, it wasn't 
like that at all, this dawn. It was completely silent, and it was blue.</p>
<p>In the dawns that we had begun to remember, one did not become aware of the light itself, but of 
the separate objects touched by the light, the things, the world. They were there, visible again, as 
if visibility were their own property, not a gift from the rising sun.</p>
<p>In this dawn, there was nothing but the light itself. Indeed there was not even light, we would 
have said, but only color: blue.</p>
<p>There was no compass bearing to it. It was not brighter in the east. There was no east or west. 
There was only up and down, below and above. Below was dark. The blue light came from above. 
Brightness fell. Beneath, where the shaking thunder had stilled, the brightness died away through 
violet into blindness.</p>
<p>We, arising, watched light fall.</p>
<p>In a way it was more like an ethereal snowfall than like a sunrise. The light seemed to be in 
discrete particles, infinitesimal flecks, slowly descending, faint, fainter than flecks of fine snow on 
a dark night, and tinier; but blue. A soft, penetrating blue tending to the violet, the color of the 
shadows in an iceberg, the color of a streak of sky between gray clouds on a winter afternoon 
before snow: faint in intensity but vivid in hue: the color of the remote, the color of the cold, the 
color farthest from the sun.</p>
<subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
<p>On Saturday night they held a scientific congress in our room. Clara and Max came, of course, and the 
engineer Phil Drum and three others who had worked on the sun tap. Phil Drum was very pleased with 
himself because he had actually built one of the things, a solar cell, and brought it along. I don't think it 
had occurred to either Max or Simon to build one. Once they knew it could be done they were satisfied 
and wanted to get on with something else. But Phil unwrapped his baby with a lot of flourish, and people 
made remarks like, "Mr. Watson, will you come here a minute," and "Hey, Wilbur, you're off the 
ground!" and "I say, nasty mould you've got there, Alec; why don't you throw it out?" and "Ugh, ugh, 
burns, burns, wow, ow," the latter from Max, who does look a little pre-Mousterian. Phil explained that 
he had exposed the cell for one minute at four in the afternoon up in Washington Park during a light rain. 
The lights were back on on the West Side since Thursday, so we could test it without being conspicuous.</p>
<p>We turned off the lights, after Phil had wired the table-lamp cord to the cell. He turned on the lamp 
switch. The bulb came on, about twice as bright as before, at its full forty watts—city power of course 
was never full strength. We all looked at it. It was a dime-store table lamp with a metallized gold base 
and a white plasticloth shade.</p>
<p>"Brighter than a thousand suns," Simon murmured from the bed.</p>
<p>"Brighter than a thousand suns," Simon murmured from the bed.</p>
<p>"It really wouldn't be any good at all for making bombs with," Max said dreamily.</p>
<p>"Bombs," Phil Drum said with scorn. "Bombs are obsolete. Don't you realize that we could move a 
mountain with this kind of power? I mean pick up Mount Hood, move it, and set it down. We could 
thaw Antarctica, we could freeze the Congo. We could sink a continent. Give me a fulcrum and I'll move 
the world. Well, Archimedes, you've got your fulcrum. The sun."</p>
<p>"Christ," Simon said, "the radio, Belle!"</p>
<p>The bathroom door was shut and I had put cotton over the bug, but he was right; if they were going to go 
ahead at this rate, there had better be some added static. And though I liked watching their faces in the 
clear light of the lamp—they all had good, interesting faces, well worn, like the handles of wooden tools 
or the rocks in a running stream—I did not much want to listen to them talk tonight. Not because I wasn't 
a scientist; that made no difference. And not because I disagreed or disapproved or disbelieved anything 
they said. Only because it grieved me terribly, their talking. Because they couldn't rejoice aloud over a 
job done and a discovery made, but had to hide there and whisper about it. Because they couldn't go out 
into the sun.</p>
<p>I went into the bathroom with my viola and sat on the toilet lid and did a long set of sautille exercises. 
Then I tried to work at the Forrest trio, but it was too assertive. I played the solo part from Harold in 
Italy, which is beautiful, but it wasn't quite the right mood either. They were still going strong in the other 
room. I began to improvise.</p>
<p>After a few minutes in E-minor the light over the shaving mirror began to flicker and dim; then it died. 
Another outage. The table lamp in the other room did not go out, being connected with the sun, not with 
the twenty-three atomic fission plants that power the Greater Portland Area. Within two seconds 
somebody had switched it off too, so that we shouldn't be the only window in the West Hills left alight; 
and I could hear them rooting for candles and rattling matches. I went on improvising in the dark. Without 
light, when you couldn't see all the hard shiny surfaces of things, the sound seemed softer and less 
muddled. I went on, and it began to shape up. All the laws of harmonics sang together when the bow 
came down. The strings of the viola were the cords of my own voice, tightened by sorrow, tuned to the 
pitch of joy. The melody created itself out of air and energy, it raised up the valleys, and the mountains 
and hills were made low, and the crooked straight, and the rough places plain. And the music went out to 
the dark sea and sang in the darkness, over the abyss.</p>
<p>When I came out they were all sitting there and none of them was talking. Max had been crying. I could 
see little candle flames in the tears around his eyes. Simon lay flat on the bed in the shadows, his eyes 
closed. Phil Drum sat hunched over, holding the solar cell in his hands.</p>
<p>I loosened the pegs, put the bow and the viola in the case, and cleared my throat. It was embarrassing. I 
finally said, "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>One of the women spoke: Rose Abramski, a private student of Simon's, a big shy woman who could 
hardly speak at all unless it was in mathematical symbols. "I saw it," she said. "I saw it. I saw the white 
towers, and the water streaming down their sides, and running back down to the sea. And the sunlight 
shining in the streets, after ten thousand years of darkness."</p>
<p>"I heard them," Simon said, very low, from the shadow. "I heard their voices."</p>
<p>"Oh, Christ! Stop it" Max cried out, and got up and went blundering out into the unlit hall, without his 
coat. We heard him running down the stairs.</p>
<p>"Oh, Christ! Stop it" Max cried out, and got up and went blundering out into the unlit hall, without his 
coat. We heard him running down the stairs.</p>
<p>After a long silence Phil Drum answered, "We have the power to doit."</p>
<p>"What else do we need?" Simon said. "What else do we need, besides power?"</p>
<p>Nobody answered him.</p>

<p>The blue changed. It became brighter, lighter, and at the same time thicker: impure. The ethereal 
luminosity of blue-violet turned to turquoise, intense and opaque. Still we could not have said that 
everything was now turquoise colored, for there were still no things. There was nothing, except 
the color of turquoise.</p>
<p>The change continued. The opacity became veined and thinned. The dense, solid color began to 
appear translucent, transparent. Then it seemed as if we were in the heart of a sacred jade, or the 
brilliant crystal of a sapphire or an emerald.</p>
<p>As at the inner structure of a crystal, there was no motion. But there was something, now, to see. 
It was as if we saw the motionless, elegant inward structure of the molecules of a precious stone. 
Planes and angles</p>
<p>appeared about us, shadowless and clear in that even, glowing, blue-green light.</p>
<p>These were the walls and towers of the city, the streets, the windows, the gates.</p>
<p>We knew them, but we did not recognize them. We did not dare to recognize them. It had been so 
long. And it was so strange. We had used to dream, when we lived in this city. We had lain down, 
nights, in the rooms behind the windows, and slept, and dreamed. We had all dreamed of the 
ocean, of the deep sea. Were we not dreaming now?</p>
<p>Sometimes the thunder and tremor deep below us rolled again, but it was faint now, far away; as 
far away as our memory of the thunder and the tremor and the fire and the towers falling, long 
ago. Neither the sound nor the memory frightened us. We knew them.</p>
<p>The sapphire light brightened overhead to green, almost green-gold. We looked up. The tops of 
the highest towers were hard to see, glowing in the radiance of light. The streets and doorways 
were darker, more clearly defined.</p>
<p>In one of those long, jewel-dark streets something was moving— something not composed of 
planes and angles, but of curves and arcs. We all turned to look at it, slowing, wondering as we 
did so at the slow ease of our own motion, our freedom. Sinuous, with a beautiful flowing, 
gathering, rolling movement, now rapid and now tentative, the thing drifted across the street 
from a blank garden wall to the recess of a door. There, in the dark blue shadow, it was hard to 
see for a while. We watched. A pale blue curve appeared at the top of the doorway. A second 
followed, and a third. The moving thing clung or hovered there, above the door, like a swaying 
knot of silvery cords or a boneless hand, one arched finger pointing carelessly to something above 
the lintel of the door, something like itself, but motionless—a carving. A carving in jade light. A 
carving in stone.</p>
<p>Delicately and easily the long curving tentacle followed the curves of the carved figure, the eight 
petal-limbs, the round eyes. Did it recognize its image?</p>
<p>Delicately and easily the long curving tentacle followed the curves of the carved figure, the eight 
petal-limbs, the round eyes. Did it recognize its image?</p>
<p>Down another street, about the level of the first-floor windows, came a flickering drift of 
hundreds of motes of silver. With a single motion all turned toward the cross street, and glittered 
off into the dark blue</p>
<p>shadows.</p>
<p>There were shadows, now.</p>
<p>We looked up, up from the flight of silver fish, up from the streets where the jade-green currents 
flowed and the blue shadows fell. We moved and looked up, yearning, to the high towers of our 
city. They stood, the fallen towers. They glowed in the ever-brightening radiance, not blue or 
blue-green, up there, but gold. Far above them lay a vast, circular, trembling brightness: the sun's 
light on the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>We are here. When we break through the bright circle into life, the water will break and stream 
white down the white sides of the towers, and run down the steep streets back into the sea. The 
water will glitter in dark hair, on the eyelids of dark eyes, and dry to a thin white film of salt.</p>
<p>We are here.</p>
<p>Whose voice? Who called to us?</p>
<subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
<p>He was with me for twelve days. On January 28, the 'crats came from the Bureau of Health, Education, 
and Welfare and said that since he was receiving Unemployment Compensation while suffering from an 
untreated illness, the government must look after him and restore him to health, because health is the 
inalienable right of the citizens of a democracy. He refused to sign the consent forms, so the chief health 
officer signed them. He refused to get up, so two of the policemen pulled him up off the bed. He started 
to try to fight them. The chief health officer pulled his gun and said that if he continued to struggle he 
would shoot him for resisting welfare, and arrest me for conspiracy to defraud the government. The man 
who was holding my arms behind my back said they could always arrest me for unreported pregnancy 
with intent to form a nuclear family. At that, Simon stopped trying to get free. It was really all he was 
trying to do, not to right them, just to get his arms free. He looked at me, and they took him out.</p>
<p>He is in the Federal Hospital in Salem. I have not been able to find out whether he is in the regular 
hospital or the mental wards.</p>
<p>It was on the radio again yesterday, about the rising land masses in the South Atlantic and the Western 
Pacific. At Max's the other night I saw a TV special explaining about geophysical stresses and 
subsidence and faults. The U.S. Geodetic Service is doing a lot of advertising around town; the most 
common one is a big billboard that says IT'S NOT OUR FAULT! with a picture of a beaver pointing to 
a schematic map that shows how even if Oregon has a major earthquake and subsidence as California 
did last month, it will not affect Portland, or only the western suburbs perhaps. The news also said that 
they plan to halt the tidal waves in Florida by dropping nuclear bombs where Miami was. Then they will 
reattach Florida to the mainland with landfill. They are already advertising real estate for housing 
developments on the landfill. The president is staying at the Mile High White House in Aspen, Colorado. 
I don't think it will do him much good. Houseboats down on the Willamette are selling for $500,000. 
There are no trains or buses running south from Portland, because all the highways were badly damaged 
by the tremors and landslides last week, so I will have to see if I can get to Salem on foot. I still have the 
rucksack I bought for the Mount Hood Wilderness Week. I got some dry lima beans and raisins with my 
Federal Fair Share Super Value Green Stamp minimal ration book for February—it took the whole 
book—and Phil Drum made me a tiny camp stove powered with the solar cell. I didn't want to take the 
Primus, it's too bulky, and I did want to be able to carry the viola. Max gave me a half pint of brandy. 
When the brandy is gone I expect I will stuff this notebook into the bottle and put the cap on tight and 
leave it on a hillside somewhere between here and Salem. I like to think of it being lifted up little by little 
by the water, and rocking, and going out to the dark sea.</p>
