Ursula K. Le Guin</emphasis></strong></p>

<p><emphasis>When I wrote this story, a year before I began the novel</emphasis> The Left Hand of Darkness,<emphasis> I
did not know that the inhabitants of the planet Winter or Gethen were
androgynes. By the time the story came out in print, I did, but too
late to emend such usages as "son,""mother," and so on. </emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Many feminists have been grieved or aggrieved by</emphasis> The Left Hand of Darkness <emphasis>because
the androgynes in it are called "he" throughout. In the
third person singular, the English generic pronoun is the same as the
masculine pronoun. A fact worth reflecting upon. And it's a trap,
with no way out, because the exclusion of the feminine (she) and the
neuter (it) from the generic/masculine (he) makes the use of either of
them</emphasis> more <emphasis>specific</emphasis>, more <emphasis>unjust, as it were, than the
use of "he." And I find made-up pronouns, "te"
and "heshe" and so on, dreary and annoying</emphasis>.</p>

<p><emphasis>In revising the story for this edition, I saw a chance to
redress that injustice slightly. In this version, I use the feminine
pronoun for all Gethenians</emphasis>--<emphasis>while preserving certain
masculine titles such as King and Lord, just to remind one of the
ambiguity. This may drive some nonfeminists mad, but that's only
fair</emphasis>.</p>

<p><emphasis>The androgyny of the characters has little to do with the events
of this story, but the pronoun change does make it clear that the
central, paradoxical relationship of parent and child is not, as it may
have seemed in the other version, a kind of reverse Oedipus twist, but something less -familiar and more
ambiguous. Evidently my unconscious mind knew about the Gethenians long
before it saw fit to inform me. It's always doing things like
that.</emphasis></p>

<p>When whirlpools appear in the onward run of time and history seems
to swirl around a snag, as in the curious matter of the Succession of
Karhide, then pictures come in handy: snapshots, which may be taken up
and matched to compare the parent to the child, the young king to the
old, and which may also be rearranged and shuffled till the years run
straight. For despite the tricks played by instantaneous interstellar
communication and just-sub-lightspeed interstellar travel, time (as the
Plenipotentiary Axt remarked) does not reverse itself; nor is death
mocked.</p>

<p>Thus, although the best-known picture is that dark image of a young
king standing above an old king who lies dead in a corridor lit only by
mirror-reflections of a burning city, set it aside a while. Look first
at the young king, a nation's pride, as bright and fortunate a
soul as ever lived to the age of twenty-two; but when this picture was
taken the young king had her back against a wall. She was filthy, she
was trembling, and her face was blank and mad, for she had lost that
minimal confidence in the world which is called sanity. Inside her head
she repeated, as she had been repeating for hours or years, over and
over, "I will abdicate. I will abdicate. I will abdicate."
Inside her eyes she saw the red-walled rooms of the Palace, the towers
and streets of Erhenrang in falling snow, the lovely plains of the West
Fall, the white summits of the Kargav, and she renounced them all, her
kingdom. "I will abdicate," she said not aloud and then,
aloud, screamed as once again the person dressed in red and white
approached her saying, "Majesty! A plot against your life has
been discovered in the Artisan School," and the humming noise
began, softly. She hid her head in her arms and whispered, "Stop
it, please stop it," but the humming whine grew higher and louder
and nearer, relentless, until it was so high and loud that it entered
her flesh, tore the nerves from their channels and made her bones dance
and jangle, hopping to its tune. She hopped and twitched, bare bones
strung on thin white threads, and wept dry tears, and shouted,
"Have them-- Have them-- They must--
Executed-- Stopped-- Stop!"</p>

<p>It stopped.</p>

<p>She fell in a clattering, chattering heap to the floor. What floor?
Not red tiles, not parquetry, not urine-stained cement, but the wood
floor of the room in the tower, the little tower bedroom where she was
safe, safe from her ogre parent, the cold, mad, uncaring king, safe to
play cat's cradle with Piry and to sit by the fireside on
Borhub's warm lap, as warm and deep as sleep. But there was no
hiding, no safety, no sleep. The person dressed in black had come even
here and had hold of her head, lifted it up, lifted on thin white
strings the eyelids she tried to close.</p>

<p>"Who am I?"</p>

<p>The blank, black mask stared down. The young king struggled,
sobbing, because now the suffocation would begin: she would not be able
to breathe until she said the name, the right name--
"Gerer!"--She could breathe. She was allowed to
breathe. She had recognized the black one in time.</p>

<p>"Who am I?" said a different voice, gently, and the
young king groped for that strong presence that always brought her
sleep, truce, solace. "Rebade," she whispered, "tell
me what to do..."</p>

<p>"Sleep."</p>

<p>She obeyed. A deep sleep, and dreamless, for it was real. Dreams
came at waking, now. Unreal, the horrible dry red light of sunset
burned her eyes open and she stood, once more, on the Palace balcony
looking down at fifty thousand black pits opening and shutting. From
the pits came a paroxysmic gush of sound, a shrill, rhythmic
eructation: her name. Her name was roared in her ears as a taunt, a
jeer. She beat her hands on the narrow brass railing and shouted at
them, "I will silence you!" She could not hear her voice,
only their voice, the pestilent mouths of the mob that hated her,
screaming her name. "Come away, my king," said the one
gentle voice, and Rebade drew her away from the balcony into the vast,
red-walled quiet of the Hall of Audience. The screaming ceased with a
click. Rebade's expression was as always composed, compassionate.
"What will you do now?" she said in her gentle voice.</p>

<p>"I will-- I will abdicate--"</p>

<p>"No," Rebade said calmly. "That is not right. What will you do now?"</p>

<p>The young king stood silent, shaking. Rebade helped her sit down on
the iron cot, for the walls had darkened as they often did and drawn in
all about her to a little cell. "You will call..."</p>

<p>"Call up the Erhenrang Guard. Have them shoot into the crowd.
Shoot to kill. They must be taught a lesson." The young king
spoke rapidly and distinctly in a loud, high voice. Rebade said,
"Very good, my lord, a wise decision! Right. We shall come out
all right. You are doing right. Trust me."</p>

<p>"I do. I trust you. Get me out of here," the young king
whispered, seizing Rebade's arm: but her friend frowned. That was
not right. She had driven Rebade and hope away again. Rebade was
leaving now, calm and regretful, though the young king begged her to
stop, to come back, for the noise was softly beginning again, the
whining hum that tore the mind to pieces, and already the person in red
and white was approaching across a red, interminable floor.
"Majesty! A plot against your life has been discovered in the
Artisan School--"</p><empty-line /><p>Down Old Harbor Street to the water's edge the street lamps
burned cavernously bright. Guard Pepenerer on her rounds glanced down
that slanting vault of light expecting nothing, and saw something
staggering up it towards her. Pepenerer did not believe in porngropes,
but she saw a porngrope, sea-beslimed, staggering on thin webbed feet,
gasping dry air, whimpering....Old sailors' tales slid out of
Pepenerer's mind and she saw a drunk or a maniac or a victim
staggering between the dank grey warehouse walls. "Now then! Hold
on there!" she bellowed, on the run. The drunk, half naked and
wild-eyed, let out a yell of terror and tried to dodge away, slipped on
the frost-slick stones of the street and pitched down sprawling.
Pepenerer got out her gun and delivered a half-second of stun, just to
keep the drunk quiet; then squatted down by her, wound up her radio and
called the West Ward for a car.</p>

<p>Both the arms, sprawled out limp and meek on the cold cobbles, were
blotched with injection marks. Not drunk; drugged. Pepenerer sniffed,
but got no resinous scent of orgrevy. She had been drugged, then;
thieves, or a ritual clan-revenge. Thieves would not have left the gold
ring on the forefinger, a massive thing, carved, almost as wide as the
fingerjoint. Pepenerer crouched forward to look at it. Then she turned
her head and looked at the beaten, blank face in profile against the
paving-stones, hard lit by the glare of the street lamps. She took a
new quarter-crown piece out of her pouch and looked at the left profile
stamped on the bright tin, then back at the right profile stamped in
light and shadow and cold stone. Then, hearing the purr of the electric
car turning down from the Long-way into Old Harbor Street, she stuck
the coin back in her pouch, muttering to herself, "Damn
fool."</p>

<p>King Argaven was off hunting in the mountains, anyhow, and had been for a couple of weeks; it had been in all the bulletins.</p><empty-line /><p>"You see," said Hoge the physician, "we can assume
that she was mindformed; but that gives us almost nothing to go on.
There are too many expert mindformers in Karhide, and in Orgoreyn for
that matter. Not criminals whom the police might have a lead on, but
respectable mentalists or physicians. To whom the drugs are legally
available. As for getting anything from her, if they had any skill at
all they will have blocked everything they did to rational access. All
clues will be buried, the trigger-suggestions hidden, and we simply
cannot guess what questions to ask. There is no way, short of
brain-destruction, of going through everything in her mind; and even
under hypnosis and deep drugging there would be no way now to
distinguish implanted ideas or emotions from her own autonomous ones.
Perhaps the Aliens could do something, though I doubt their mindscience
is all they boast of; at any rate it's out of reach. We have only
one real hope."</p>

<p>"Which is?" Lord Gerer asked, stolidly.</p>

<p>"The king is quick and resolute. At the beginning, before they
broke her, she may have known what they were doing to her, and so set
up some block or resistance, left herself some escape
route..."</p>

<p>Hoge's low voice lost confidence as she spoke, and trailed off
in the silence of the high, red, dusky room. She drew no response from
old Gerer who stood, black-clad, before the fire.</p>

<p>The temperature of that room in the King's Palace of Erhenrang
was 12deg C where Lord Gerer stood, and 5deg midway between the two
big fireplaces; outside it was snowing lightly, a mild day only a few
degrees below freezing. Spring had come to Winter. The fires at either
end of the room roared red and gold, devouring thigh-thick logs.
Magnificence, a harsh luxury, a quick splendor; fireplaces, fireworks,
lightning, meteors, volcanoes; such things satisfied the people of
Karhide on the world called Winter. But, except in Arctic colonies
above the 35th parallel, they had never installed central heating in
any building in the many centuries of their Age of Technology. Comfort
was allowed to come to them rare, welcome, unsought: a gift, like joy.</p>

<p>The king's personal servant, sitting by the bed, turned
towards the physician and the Lord Councilor, though she did not speak.</p>

<p>Both at once crossed the room. The broad, hard bed, high on gilt
pillars, heavy with a finery of red cloaks and coverlets, bore up the
king's body almost level with their eyes. To Gerer it appeared a
ship breasting, motionless, a swift vast flood of darkness, carrying
the young king into shadows, terrors, years. Then with a terror of her
own the old councilor saw that Argaven's eyes were open, staring
out a half-curtained window at the stars.</p>

<p>Gerer feared lunacy; idiocy; she did not know what she feared. Hoge
had warned her: "The king will not behave 'normally,'
Lord Gerer. She has suffered thirteen days of torment, intimidation,
exhaustion, and mindhandling. There may be brain damage, there will
certainly be side- and after-effects of drugs." Neither fear nor
warning parried the shock. Argaven's bright, weary eyes turned to
Gerer and paused on her blankly a moment; then saw her. And Gerer,
though she could not see the black mask reflected, saw the hate, the
horror, saw her young king, infinitely beloved, gasping in imbecile
terror and struggling with the servant, with Hoge, with her own
weakness in the effort to get away, to get away from Gerer.</p>

<p>Standing in the cold midst of the room where the prowlike head of
the bedstead hid her from the king, Gerer heard them pacify Argaven and
settle her down again. Argaven's voice sounded reedy, childishly
plaintive. So the Old King, Emran, had spoken in her last madness with
a child's voice. Then silence, and the burning of the two great
fires.</p>

<p>Korgry, the king's bodyservant, yawned and rubbed her eyes.
Hoge measured something from a vial into a hypodermic. Gerer stood in
despair. My child, my king, what have they done to you? So great a
trust, so fair a promise, lost, lost... So the one who looked like
a lump of half-carved black rock, a heavy, prudent, rude old courtier,
grieved and was passion-racked, her love and service of the young king
being the world's one worth to her.</p>

<p>Argaven spoke aloud: "My child--"</p>

<p>Gerer winced, feeling the words torn out of her own mind; but Hoge,
untroubled by love, comprehended and said softly to Argaven,
"Prince Emran is well, my liege. She is with her attendants at
Warrever Castle. We are in constant communication. All is well
there."</p>

<p>Gerer heard the king's harsh breathing, and came somewhat
closer to the bed, though out of sight still behind the high headboard.</p>

<p>"Have I been sick?"</p>

<p>"You are not well yet," the physician said, bland.</p>

<p>"Where--"</p>

<p>"Your own room, in the Palace, in Erhenrang."</p>

<p>But Gerer, coming a step closer, though not in view of the king, said, "We do not know where you have been."</p>

<p>Hoge's smooth face creased with a frown, though, physician as
she was and so in her way ruler of them all, she dared not direct the
frown at the Lord Councilor. Gerer's voice did not seem to
trouble the king, who asked another question or two, sane and brief,
and then lay quiet. Presently the servant Korgry, who had sat with her
ever since she had been brought into the Palace (last night, in secret,
by side doors, like a shameful suicide of the last reign, but all in
reverse), Korgry committed lese-majeste: huddled forward on her high
stool, she let her head droop on the side of the bed, and slept. The
guard at the door yielded place to a new guard, in whispers. Officials
came and received a fresh bulletin for public release on the state of
the king's health, in whispers. Stricken by symptoms of fever
while vacationing in the High Kargav, the king had been rushed to
Erhenrang, and was now responding satisfactorily to treatment, etc.
Physician Hoge rem ir Hogeremme at the Palace has released the
following statement, etc., etc. "May the Wheel turn for our
king," people in village houses said solemnly as they lit the
fire on the altarhearth, to which elders sitting near the fire
remarked, "It comes of her roving around the city at night and climbing mountains, fool tricks like,"
but they kept the radio on to catch the next bulletin. A very great
number of people had come and gone and loitered and chatted this
day in the square before the Palace, watching those who went in and
out, watching the vacant balcony; there were still several hundred down
there, standing around patiently in the snow. Argaven XVII was loved in
her domain. After the dull brutality of King Emran's reign that
had ended in the shadow of madness and the country's bankruptcy,
she had come: sudden, gallant, young, changing everything; sane and
shrewd, yet magnanimous. She had the fire, the splendor that suited her
people. She was the force and center of a new age: one born, for once,
king of the right kingdom.</p>

<p>"Gerer."</p>

<p>It was the king's voice, and Gerer hastened stiffly through the hot and cold of the great room, the firelight and dark.</p>

<p>Argaven was sitting up. Her arms shook and the breath caught in her
throat; her eyes burned across the dark air at Gerer. By her left hand,
which bore the Sign-Ring of the Harge dynasty, lay the sleeping face of
the servant, derelict, serene. "Gerer," the king said with
effort and clarity, "summon the Council. Tell them, I will
abdicate."</p>

<p>So crude, so simple? All the drugs, the terrorizing, the hypnosis,
parahypnosis, neurone-stimulation, synapse-pairing, spotshock that Hoge
had described, for this blunt result? But reasoning must wait. They
must temporize. "My liege, when your strength
returns--"</p>

<p>"Now. Call the Council, Gerer!"</p>

<p>Then she broke, like a bowstring breaking, and stammered in a fury
of fear that found no sense or strength to flesh itself in; and still
her faithful servant slept beside her, deaf.</p><empty-line /><p>In the next picture things are going better, it appears. Here is
King Argaven XVII in good health and good clothes, finishing a large
breakfast. She talks with the nearer dozen of the forty or fifty people
sharing or serving the meal (singularity is a king's prerogative,
but seldom privacy), and includes the rest in the largesse of her
courtesy. She looks, as everyone has said, quite herself again.
Perhaps she is not quite herself again, however; something is missing,
a youthful serenity, a confidence, replaced by a similar but less
reassuring quality, a kind of heedlessness. Out of it she rises in wit
and warmth, but always subsides to it again, that darkness which
absorbs her and makes her heedless: fear, pain, resolution?</p>

<p>Mr. Mobile Axt, Ambassador Plenipotentiary to Winter from the Ekumen
of the Known Worlds, who had spent the last six days on the road trying
to drive an electric car faster than 50 kph from Mishnory in Orgoreyn
to Erhenrang in Karhide, overslept breakfast, and so arrived in the
Audience Hall prompt, but hungry. The old Chief of the Council, the
king's cousin Gerer rem ir Verhen, met the Alien at the door of
the great hall and greeted him with the polysyllabic politeness of
Karhide. The Plenipotentiary responded as best he could, discerning
beneath the eloquence Gerer's desire to tell him something.</p>

<p>"I am told the king is perfectly recovered," he said, "and I heartily hope this is true."</p>

<p>"It is not," the old Councilor said, her voice suddenly
blunt and toneless. "Mr. Axt, I tell you this trusting your
confidence; there are not ten others in Karhide who know the truth. She
is not recovered. She was not sick."</p>

<p>Axt nodded. There had of course been rumors.</p>

<p>"She will go alone in the city sometimes, at night, in common
clothes, walking, talking with strangers. The pressures of
kingship... She is very young." Gerer paused a moment,
struggling with some suppressed emotion. "One night six weeks
ago, she did not come back. A message was delivered to me and the
Second Lord, at dawn. If we announced her disappearance, she would be
killed; if we waited a half-month in silence she would be restored
unhurt. We kept silent, lied to the Council, sent out false news. On
the thirteenth night she was found wandering in the city. She had been
drugged and mindformed. By which enemy or faction we do not yet know.
We must work in utter secrecy; we cannot wreck the people's
confidence in her, her own confidence in herself. It is hard: she
remembers nothing. But what they did is plain. They broke her will and
bent her mind all to one thing. She believes she must abdicate the
throne."</p>

<p>The voice remained low and flat; the eyes betrayed anguish. And the
Plenipotentiary turning suddenly saw the reflection of that anguish in
the eyes of the young king.</p>

<p>"Holding my audience, cousin?"</p>

<p>Argaven smiled but there was a knife in it. The old Councilor
excused herself stolidly, bowed, left, a patient ungainly figure
diminishing down a long corridor.</p>

<p>Argaven stretched out both hands to the Plenipotentiary in the
greeting of equals, for in Karhide the Ekumen was recognized as a
sister kingdom, though not a living soul had seen it. But her words
were not the polite discourse that Axt expected. All she said, and
fiercely, was, "At last!"</p>

<p>"I left as soon as I received your message. The roads are
still icy in East Orgoreyn and the West Fall, I couldn't make
very good time. But I was very glad to come. Glad to leave, too."
Axt smiled saying this, for he and the young king enjoyed each
other's candor. What Argaven's welcome implied, he waited
to see, watching, with some exhilaration, the mobile, beautiful,
androgynous face.</p>

<p>"Orgoreyn breeds bigots as a corpse breeds worms, as one of my
ancestors remarked. I'm glad you find the air fresher here
in Karhide. Come this way. Gerer told you that I was kidnapped, and
so forth? Yes. It was all according to the old rules. Kidnapping is a
quite formal art. If it had been one of the anti-Alien groups who think
your Ekumen intends to enslave the earth, they might have ignored the
rules; I think it was one of the old clan-factions hoping to regain
power through me, the power they had in the last reign. But we
don't know, yet. It's strange, to know that one has seen
them face to face and yet can't recognize them; who knows but
that I see those faces daily? Well, no profit in such notions. They
wiped out all their tracks. I am sure only of one thing. <emphasis>They</emphasis> did not tell me that I must abdicate."</p>

<p>She and the Plenipotentiary were walking side by side up the long,
immensely high room toward the dais and chairs at the far end. The
windows were little more than slits, as usual on this cold world;
fulvous strips of sunlight fell from them diagonally to the red-paved
floor, dusk and dazzle in Axt's eyes. He looked up at the young
king's face in that somber, shifting radiance. "Who
then?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"When, my lord, and why?"</p>

<p>"When they had me, when they were remaking me to fit their
mold and play their game. Why? So that I can't fit their mold and
play their game! Listen, Lord Axt, if they wanted me dead they'd
have killed me. They want me alive, to govern, to be king. As such I am
to follow the orders imprinted in my brain, gain their ends for them. I
am their tool, their machine, waiting for the switch to be thrown. The
only way to prevent that, is to... discard the machine."</p>

<p>Axt was quick of understanding, that being a minimal qualification
of a Mobile of the Ekumen; besides, the manners and affairs of Karhide,
the stresses and seditions of that lively kingdom, were well known to
him. Remote though Winter was, both in space and in the physiology of
its inhabitants, from the rest of the human race, yet its dominant
nation, Karhide, had proved a loyal member of the Ekumen. Axt's
reports were discussed in the central councils of the Ekumen eighty
lightyears away; the equilibrium of the Whole rests in all its parts.
Axt said, as they sat down in the great stiff chairs on the dais before
the fire, "But they need not even throw switches, if you
abdicate."</p>

<p>"Leaving my child as heir, and a Regent of my own choice?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Axt said with caution, "they chose your Regent for you."</p>

<p>The king frowned. "I think not," she said.</p>

<p>"Whom had you thought of naming?"</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Axt saw the muscles of Argaven's
throat working as she struggled to get a word, a name, up past a block,
a harsh constriction; at last she said, in a forced, strangled whisper,
"Gerer."</p>

<p>Axt nodded, startled. Gerer had served as Regent for a year after
Emran's death and before Argaven's accession; he knew her
honesty and her utter devotion to the young king. "Gerer serves
no faction!" he said.</p>

<p>Argaven shook her head. She looked exhausted. After a while she
said, "Could the science of your people undo what was done to me,
Lord Axt?"</p>

<p>"Possibly. In the Institute on Ollul. But if I sent for a
specialist tonight, he'd get here twenty-four years from
now... You're sure, then, that your decision to abdicate
was--" But a servant, coming in a side door behind them, set
a small table by the Plenipotentiary's chair and loaded it with
fruit, sliced bread-apple, a silver tankard of ale. Argaven had noticed
that her guest had missed his breakfast. Though the fare on Winter,
mostly vegetable and that mostly uncooked, was dull stuff to
Axt's taste, he set to gratefully; and as serious talk was
unseemly over food, Argaven shifted to generalities. "Once you
said, Lord Axt, that different as I am from you, and different as my
people are from yours, yet we are blood kin. Was that a moral fact, or
a material one?"</p>

<p>Axt smiled at the very Karhidish distinction. "Both, my lord.
As far as we know, which is a tiny corner of dusty space under the
rafters of the Universe, all the people we've run into are in
fact human. But the kinship goes back a million years and more, to the
Fore-Eras of Hain. The ancient Hainish settled a hundred worlds."</p>

<p>"We call the time before my dynasty ruled Karhide 'ancient.' Seven hundred years ago!"</p>

<p>"So we call the Age of the Enemy 'ancient,' and
that was less than six hundred years ago. Time stretches and shrinks;
changes with the eye, with the age, with the star; does all except
reverse itself--or repeat."</p>

<p>"The dream of the Ekumen, then, is to restore that truly
ancient commonalty; to regather all the peoples of all the worlds at
one hearth?"</p>

<p>Axt nodded, chewing bread-apple. "To weave some harmony among
them, at least. Life loves to know itself, out to its furthest limits;
to embrace complexity is its delight. Our difference is our beauty. All
these worlds and the various forms and ways of the minds and lives and
bodies on them--together they would make a splendid harmony."</p>

<p>"No harmony endures," said the young king.</p>

<p>"None has ever been achieved," said the Plenipotentiary.
"The pleasure is in trying." He drained his tankard, wiped
his fingers on the woven-grass napkin.</p>

<p>"That was my pleasure as king," said Argaven. "It is over."</p>

<p>"Should--"</p>

<p>"It is finished. Believe me. I will keep you here, Lord Axt,
until you believe me. I need your help. You are the piece the
game-players forgot about! You must help me. I cannot abdicate against
the will of the Council. They will refuse my abdication, force me to
rule, and if I rule, I serve my enemies! If you will not help me, I
will have to kill myself." She spoke quite evenly and reasonably;
but Axt knew what even the mention of suicide, the ultimately contemptible act, cost a Karhider.</p>

<p>"One way or the other," said the young king.</p>

<p>The Plenipotentiary pulled his heavy cloak closer round him; he was
cold. He had been cold for seven years, here. "My lord," he
said, "I am an alien on your world, with a handful of aides, and
a little device with which I can converse with other aliens on distant
worlds. I represent power, of course, but I have none. How can I help
you?"</p>

<p>"You have a ship on Horden Island."</p>

<p>"Ah. I was afraid of that," said the Plenipotentiary,
sighing. "Lord Argaven, that ship is set for Ollul, twenty-four
lightyears away. Do you know what that means?"</p>

<p>"My escape from my time, in which I have become an instrument of evil."</p>

<p>"There is no escape," said Axt, with sudden intensity,
"No, my lord. Forgive me. It is impossible. I could not
consent-- "</p><empty-line /><p>Icy rain of spring rattled on the stones of the tower, wind whined
at the angles and finials of the roof. The room was quiet, shadowy. One
small shielded light burned by the door. The nurse lay snoring mildly
in the bed, the baby was head down, rump up in the crib. Argaven stood
beside the crib. She looked around the room, or rather saw it, knew it
wholly, without looking. She too had slept here as a little child. It
had been her first kingdom. It was here that she had come to suckle her
child, her first-born, had sat by the fireplace while the little mouth
tugged at her breast, had hummed to the baby the songs Borhub had
hummed to her. This was the center, the center of, every thing.</p>

<p>Very cautiously and gently she slipped her hand under the
baby's warm, damp, downy head, and put over it a chain on which
hung a massive ring carved with the token of the Lords of Harge. The chain was far too long, and Argaven knotted it shorter, thinking
that it might twist and choke the child. So allaying that small
anxiety, she tried to allay the great fear and wretchedness that filled
her. She stooped down till her cheek touched the baby's cheek,
whispering inaudibly, "Emran, Emran, I have to leave you, I
can't take you, you have to rule for me. Be good, Emran, live
long, rule well, be good, Emran..."</p>

<p>She straightened up, turned, ran from the tower room, the lost kingdom.</p>

<p>She knew several ways of getting out of the Palace unperceived. She
took the surest, and then made for the New Harbor through the
bright-lit, sleet-lashed streets of Erhenrang, alone.</p><empty-line /><p>Now there is no picture: no seeing her. With what eye will you watch
a process that is one hundred millionth percent slower than the speed
of light? She is not now a king, nor a human being; she is translated.
You can scarcely call fellow-mortal one whose time passes seventy
thousand times slower than yours. She is more than alone. It seems that
she is not, any more than an uncommunicated thought is; that she goes
nowhere, any more than a thought goes. And yet, at very nearly but
never quite the speed of light, she voyages. She is the voyage. Quick
as thought. She has doubled her age when she arrives, less than a day
older, in the portion of space curved about a dustmote named Ollul, the
fourth planet of a yellowish sun. And all this has passed in utter
silence.</p>

<p>With noise now, and fire and meteoric dazzle enough to satisfy a
Karhider's lust for splendor, the clever ship makes earthfall,
settling down in flame in the precise spot it left from some fifty-five
years ago. Presently, visible, unmassive, uncertain, the young king
emerges from it and stands a moment in the exitway, shielding her eyes
from the light of a strange, hot sun. Axt had of course sent notice of
her coming, by instantaneous transmitter, twenty-four years ago, or seventeen hours ago,
depending on how you look at it; and aides and agents of the Ekumen
were on hand to greet her. Even pawns did not go unnoticed by those
players of the great game, and this Gethenian was, after all, a king.
One of the agents had spent a year of the twenty-four in learning
Karhidish, so that Argaven could speak to someone. She spoke at once:
"What news from my country?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mobile Axt and his successor have sent regular summaries
of events, and various private messages for you; you'll find all
the material in your quarters, Mr. Harge. Very briefly, the regency of
Lord Gerer was uneventful and benign; there was a depression in the
first two years, during which your Arctic settlements were abandoned,
but at present the economy is quite stable. Your heir was enthroned at
eighteen, and has ruled now for seven years."</p>

<p>"Yes. I see," said the person who had kissed that year-old heir last night.</p>

<p>"Whenever you see fit, Mr. Harge, the specialists at our Institute over in Belxit-- "</p>

<p>"As you wish," said Mr. Harge.</p>

<p>They went into her mind very gently, very subtly, opening doors. For
locked doors they had delicate instruments that always found the
combination; and then they stood aside, and let her enter. They found
the person in black, who was not Gerer, and compassionate Rebade, who
was not compassionate; they stood with her on the Palace balcony, and
climbed the crevasses of nightmare with her up to the room in the
tower; and at last the one who was to have been first, the person in
red and white, approached her saying, "Majesty! A plot against
your life--" And Mr. Harge screamed in abject terror, and
woke up.</p>

<p>"Well! That was the trigger. The signal to begin tripping off
the other instructions and determine the course of your phobia. An
induced paranoia. Really beautifully induced, I must say. Here, drink this, Mr. Harge. No, it's just water! You might well have
become a remarkably vicious ruler, increasingly obsessed by fear of
plots and subversions, increasingly disaffected from your people. Not
overnight, of course. That's the beauty of it. It would have
taken several years for you to become a real tyrant; though they no
doubt planned some boosts along the way, once Rebade wormed his
way-- her way--a way into your confidence... Well, well,
I see why Karhide is well spoken of, over at the Clearinghouse. If
you'll pardon my objectivity, this kind of skill and patience is
quite rare..." So the doctor, the mindmender, the hairy,
greyish, one-sexed person from somewhere called the Cetians, went
rambling on while the patient recovered herself.</p>

<p>"Then I did right," said Mr. Harge at last.</p>

<p>"You did. Abdication, suicide, or escape were the only acts of
consequence which you could have committed of your own volition,
freely. They counted on your moral veto on suicide, and your
Council's vote on abdication. But being possessed by ambition
themselves, they forgot the possibility of abnegation, and left one
door open for you. A door which only a strong-minded person, if
you'll pardon my literalness, could choose to go through. I
really must read up on this other mindscience of yours, what do you
call it, Foretelling? Thought it was some occultist trash, but quite
evidently... Well, well, I expect they'll be wanting you to
look in at the Clearinghouse soon, to discuss your future, now that
we've put your past where it belongs, eh?"</p>

<p>"As you wish," said Mr. Harge.</p>

<p>She talked with various people there in the Clearinghouse of the
Ekumen for the West Worlds, and when they suggested that she go to
school, she assented readily. For among those mild persons, whose chief
quality seemed a cool, profound sadness indistinguishable from a warm,
profound hilarity--among them, the ex-king of Karhide knew herself
a barbarian, unlearned and unwise.</p>

<p>She attended Ekumenical School. She lived in barracks near the
Clearinghouse in Vaxtsit City, with a couple of hundred other aliens,
none of whom was either androgynous or an ex-king. Never having owned
much that was hers alone, and never having had much privacy, she did
not mind barracks life; nor was it so bad as she had expected to live
among single-sexed people, although she found their condition of
perpetual kemmer tiresome. She did not mind anything much, getting
through the works and days with vigor and competence but always a
certain heedlessness, as of one whose center is somewhere else. The
only discomfort was the heat, the awful heat of Ollul that rose
sometimes to 35deg C in the blazing interminable season when no snow
fell for two hundred days on end. Even when winter came at last she
sweated, for it seldom got more than ten degrees below freezing
outside, and the barracks were kept sweltering--she
thought--though the other aliens wore heavy sweaters all the time.
She slept on top of her bed, naked and thrashing, and dreamed of the
snows of the Kargav, the ice in Old Harbor, the ice scumming
one's ale on cool mornings in the Palace, the cold, the dear and
bitter cold of Winter.</p>

<p>She learned a good deal. She had already learned that the Earth was,
here, called Winter, and that Ollul was, here, called the Earth: one of
those facts which turn the universe inside out like a sock. She learned
that a meat diet causes diarrhea in the unaccustomed gut. She learned
that single-sexed people, whom she tried hard not to think of as
perverts, tried hard not to think of her as a pervert. She learned that
when she pronounced Ollul as Orrur some people laughed. She attempted
also to unlearn that she was a king. Once the School took her in hand
she learned and unlearned much more. She was led, by all the machines
and devices and experiences and (simplest and most demanding) words
that the Ekumen had at its disposal, into an intimation of what it
might be to understand the nature and history of a kingdom that was
over a million years old and trillions of miles wide. When she had
begun to guess the immensity of this kingdom of humanity and the durable pain and
monotonous waste of its history, she began also to see what lay beyond
its borders in space and time, and among naked rocks and furnace-suns
and the shining desolation that goes on and on she glimpsed the sources
of hilarity and serenity, the inexhaustible springs. She learned a
great many facts, numbers, myths, epics, proportions, relationships,
and so forth, and saw, beyond the borders of what she had learned, the
unknown again, a splendid immensity. In this augmentation of her mind
and being there was great satisfaction; yet she was unsatisfied. They
did not always let her go on as far as she wanted into certain fields,
mathematics, Cetian physics. "You started late, Mr. Harge,"
they said, "we have to build on the existing foundations.
Besides, we want you in subjects which you can put to use."</p>

<p>"What use?"</p>

<p>They--the ethnographer Mr. Mobile Gist represented Them at the
moment, across a library table--looked at her sardonically.
"Do you consider yourself to be of no further use, Mr.
Harge?"</p>

<p>Mr. Harge, who was generally reserved, spoke with sudden fury: "I do."</p>

<p>"A king without a country," said Gist in his flat Terran
accent, "self-exiled, believed to be dead, might feel a trifle
superfluous. But then, why do you think we're bothering with
you?"</p>

<p>"Out of kindness."</p>

<p>"Oh, kindness... However kind we are, we can give you
nothing that would make you happy, you know. Except... Well. Waste
is a pity. You were indubitably the right king for Winter, for Karhide,
for the purposes of the Ekumen. You have a sense of balance. You might
even have unified the planet. You certainly wouldn't have
terrorized and fragmented the country, as the present king seems to be
doing. What a waste! Only consider our hopes and needs, Mr. Harge, and
your own qualifications, before you despair of being useful in your life. Forty or fifty more years of it you have to live, after all..."</p>

<p>The last snapshot taken by alien sunlight: erect, in a Hainish-style
cloak of grey, a handsome person of indeterminate sex stands, sweating
profusely, on a green lawn beside the chief Agent of the Ekumen in the
West Worlds, the Stabile, Mr. Hoalans of Alb, who can meddle (if he
likes) with the destinies of forty worlds.</p>

<p>"I can't order you to go there, Argaven," says the Stabile. "Your own conscience-- "</p>

<p>"I gave up my kingdom to my conscience, twelve years ago.
It's had its due. Enough's enough," says Argaven
Harge. Then she laughs suddenly, so that the Stabile also laughs; and
they part in such harmony as the Powers of the Ekumen desire between
human souls.</p>

<p>Horden Island, off the south coast of Karhide, was given as a
freehold to the Ekumen by the Kingdom of Karhide during the reign of
Argaven XV. No one lived there. Yearly generations of seawalkies
crawled up on the barren rocks, and laid and hatched their eggs, and
raised their young, and finally led them back in long single file to
the sea. But once every ten or twenty years fire ran over the rocks and
the sea boiled on the shores, and if any seawalkies were on the island
then they died.</p>

<p>When the sea had ceased to boil, the Plenipotentiary's little
electric launch approached. The starship ran out a gossamer-steel
gangplank to the deck of the launch, and one person started to walk up
it as another one started to walk down it, so that they met in the
middle, in midair, between sea and land, an ambiguous meeting.</p>

<p>"Ambassador Horrsed? I'm Harge," said the one from
the star-ship, but the one from the launch was already kneeling, saying
aloud, in Karhidish, "Welcome, Argaven of Karhide!"</p>

<p><emphasis></emphasis></p>

<p>As he straightened up the Ambassador added in a quick whisper,
"You come as yourself-- Explain when I can-- "
Behind and below him on the deck of the launch stood a sizable group of
people, staring up intently at the newcomer. All were Karhiders by
their looks; several were very old.</p>

<p>Argaven Harge stood for a minute, two minutes, three minutes, erect
and perfectly motionless, though her grey cloak tugged and riffled in
the cold sea wind. She looked then once at the dull sun in the west,
once at the grey land north across the water, back again at the silent
people grouped below her on the deck. She strode forward so suddenly
that Ambassador Horrsed had to squeeze out of the way in a hurry. She
went straight to one of the old people on the deck of the launch.
"Are you Ker rem ir Kerheder?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"I knew you by the lame arm, Ker." She spoke clearly;
there was no guessing what emotions she felt. "I could not know
your face. After sixty years. Are there others of you I knew? I am
Argaven."</p>

<p>They were all silent. They gazed at her.</p>

<p>All at once one of them, one scored and scarred with age like wood
that has been through fire, stepped forward one step. "My liege,
I am Bannith of the Palace Guard. You served with me when I was
Drillmaster and you a child, a young child." And the grey head
bowed down suddenly, in homage, or to hide tears. Then another stepped
forward, and another. The heads that bowed were grey, white, bald; the
voices that hailed the king quavered. One, Ker of the crippled arm,
whom Argaven had known as a shy page of thirteen, spoke fiercely to
those who still stood unmoving: "This is the king. I have eyes
that have seen, and that see now. This is the king!"</p>

<p>Argaven looked at them, face after face, the bowed heads and the unbowed.</p>

<p>"I am Argaven," she said. "I was king. Who reigns now in Karhide?"</p>

<p>"Emran," one answered.</p>

<p>"My child Emran?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my liege," old Bannith said; most of the faces
were blank; but Ker said in her fierce shaking voice, "Argaven,
Argaven reigns in Karhide! I have lived to see the bright days return.
Long live the king!"</p>

<p>One of the younger ones looked at the others, and said resolutely,
"So be it. Long live the king!" And all the heads bowed low.</p>

<p>Argaven took their homage unperturbed, but as soon as a moment came
when she could address Horrsed the Plenipotentiary alone she demanded,
"What is this? What has happened? Why was I misled? I was told I
was to come here to assist you, as an aide, from the Ekumen--
"</p>

<p>"That was twenty-four years ago," said the Ambassador,
apologetically. "I've only lived here five years, my lord.
Things are going very ill in Karhide. King Emran broke off relations
with the Ekumen last year. I don't really know what the
Stabile's purpose in sending you here was at the time he sent
you; but at present, we're losing Winter. So the Agents on Hain
suggested to me that we might move out our king."</p>

<p>"But I am <emphasis>dead</emphasis>," Argaven said wrathfully. "I have been dead for sixty years!"</p>

<p>"The king is dead," said Horrsed. "Long live the king."</p>

<p>As some of the Karhiders approached, Argaven turned from the
Ambassador and went over to the rail. Grey water bubbled and slid by
the ship's side. The shore of the continent lay now to
their left, grey patched with white. It was cold: a day of early winter
in the Ice Age. The ship's engine purred softly. Argaven had not
heard that purr of an electric engine for a dozen years now, the only
kind of engine Karhide's slow and stable Age of Technology had chosen to employ. The sound of it was very pleasant to her.</p>

<p>She spoke abruptly without turning, as one who has known since
infancy that there is always someone there to answer: "Why are we
going east?"</p>

<p>"We're making for Kerm Land."</p>

<p>"Why Kerm Land?"</p>

<p>It was one of the younger ones who had come forward to answer.
"Because that part of the country is in rebellion against
the-- against King Emran. I am a Kermlander: Perreth ner
Sode."</p>

<p>"Is Emran in Erhenrang?"</p>

<p>"Erhenrang was taken by Orgoreyn, six years ago. The king is
in the new capital, east of the mountains--the Old Capital,
actually, Rer."</p>

<p>"Emran lost the West Fall?" Argaven said, and then
turning full on the stout young noble, "Lost the West Fall? Lost
Erhenrang?"</p>

<p>Perreth drew back a step, but answered promptly, "We've been in hiding behind the mountains for six years."</p>

<p>"The Orgota are in Erhenrang?"</p>

<p>"King Emran signed a treaty with Orgoreyn five years ago, ceding them the Western Provinces."</p>

<p>"A shameful treaty, your majesty," old Ker broke in,
fiercer and shakier than ever. "A fool's treaty! Emran
dances to the drums of Orgoreyn. All of us here are rebels, exiles. The
Ambassador there is an exile, in hiding!"</p>

<p>"The West Fall," Argaven said. "Argaven I took the
West Fall for Karhide seven hundred years ago--" She looked
round on the others again with her strange, keen, unheeding gaze.
"Emran--" she began, but halted. "How strong are
you in Kerm Land? Is the Coast with you?"</p>

<p>"Most Hearths of the South and East are with us."
Argaven was silent a while. "Did Emran ever bear an heir?"</p>

<p>"No heir of the flesh, my liege," Bannith said. "She sired six."</p>

<p>"She has named Girvry Harge rem ir Orek as her heir," said Perreth.</p>

<p>"Girvry? What kind of name is that? The kings of
Karhide are named Emran," Argaven said, "and Argaven."</p>

<p>Now at last comes the dark picture, the snapshot taken by firelight
--firelight, because the power plants of Rer are wrecked, the
trunk lines cut, and half the city is on fire. Snow flurries heavily
down above the flames and gleams red for a moment before it melts in
mid air, hissing faintly.</p>

<p>Snow and ice and guerrilla troops keep Orgoreyn at bay on the west
side of the Kargav Mountains. No help came to the Old King, Emran, when
her country rose against her. Her guards fled, her city burns, and now
at the end she is face to face with the usurper. But she has, at the
end, something of her family's heedless pride. She pays no
attention to the rebels. She stares at them and does not see them,
lying in the dark hallway, lit only by mirrors that reflect distant
fires, the gun with which she killed herself near her hand.</p>

<p>Stooping over the body Argaven lifts up that cold hand, and starts
to take from the age-knotted forefinger the massive, carved, gold ring.
But she does not do it. "Keep it," she whispers,
"keep it." For a moment she bends yet lower, as if she
whispered in the dead ear, or laid her cheek against that cold and
wrinkled face. Then she straightens up, and stands a while, and
presently goes out through dark corridors, by windows bright with
distant ruin, to set her house in order: Argaven, Winter's king.</p>
