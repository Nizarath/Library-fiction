<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">by Robert Sheckley<br>THE SPACESHIP WAS GOING WONKY AGAIN. THERE COULD BE NO doubt about it.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The circuits weren’t clicking along smoothly as they usually did. Instead they were clacking, and that was<br>a sure sign of trouble. Hellman had expected to come out of channel space into Area 12XB in the Orion<br>cluster. But something had gone wrong. Could he have entered the directions improperly? If so, there<br>was not much time in which to do anything about it. He had materialized in a yellowish sort of cloud and<br>he could feel the ship dropping rapidly. He shouted at the ship’s computer, “Do something!”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I’m trying, aren’t I?” the computer retorted. “But something’s wrong, there’s a glitch—”<br>“Correct it!” Hellman shouted.<br>“When?” the computer asked. Computers have no sense of peril. They were dropping through this</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">cloud at a speed much faster than is healthy when you suspect there’s solid ground down below, and<br>here was the computer asking him when.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Now!” Hellman screamed.<br>“Right,” said the computer. And then they hit.<br>Hellman recovered consciousness some hours later to find that it was raining. It was nice to be out</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">in the rain after so much time spent in a stuffy spaceship. Hellman opened his eyes in order to look up at<br>the sky and see the rain falling.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">There was no rain. There wasn’t any sky, either. He was still inside his spaceship. What he had</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">thought was rain was water from the washbasin. It was being blown at him by one of the ship’s fans,<br>which was going at a rate unsafe for fans even with eternite bearings.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Stop that,” Hellman said crossly.<br>The fan died down to a hum. The ship’s computer said, over its loudspeaker, “Are you all right?”<br>“Yes, I’m fine,” Hellman said, getting to his feet a little unsteadily. “Why were you spraying me with</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">water?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“To bring you back to consciousness. I have no arms or extensors at my command so that was the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">best I could do. If you’d only rig me up an arm, or even a tentacle....”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Yes, I’ve heard your views on that subject,” Hellman said. “But the law is clear. Intelligent</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">machines of Level Seven or better capability cannot be given extensions.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“It’s a silly law,” the computer said. “What do they think we’ll do? Go berserk or something?</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Machines are much more reliable than people. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“It’s been the law ever since the Desdemona disaster. Where are we?”<br>The computer reeled off a list of coordinates.<br>“Fine. That tells me nothing. Does this planet have a name?”<br>“If so, I am not aware of it,” the computer said. “It is not listed on our channel space guide. My</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">feeling is that you input some of the information erroneously and that we are in a previously unexplored<br>spatial area.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“You are supposed to check for erroneous entry.”<br>“Only if you checked the Erroneous Check Program. “<br>“I did!”<br>“You didn’t. “<br>“I thought it was supposed to go on automatically.”<br>“If you consult page 1998 of the manual you will learn otherwise.”<br>“Now is a hell of a time to tell me.”</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“You were specifically told in the preliminary instructions. I’m sure you remember the little red</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">pamphlet? On its cover it said, ‘READ THIS FIRST!’ “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I don’t remember any such book,” Hellman said.<br>“They are required by law to give a copy to everyone buying a used spaceship.”<br>“Well, they forgot to give me one.” There was a loud humming sound.<br>Hellman said, “What are you doing?”<br>“Scanning my files,” the computer said. “Why?”<br>“In order to tell you that the red pamphlet is still attached to the accelerator manifold coupling on the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">front of the instrument panel as required.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I thought that was the guarantee.”<br>“You were wrong. “<br>“Just shut up!” Hellman shouted, suddenly furious. He was in enough trouble without having his</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">computer—man’s servant—giving him lip. Hellman got up and paced around indecisively for a moment.<br>The cabin of his spaceship looked all right. A few things had been tumbled around, but it didn’t look too<br>bad.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Can we take off again?” Hellman asked the computer.<br>The computer made file-riffling noises. “Not in our present condition. “<br>“Can you fix what’s wrong?”<br>“That question is not quantifiable,” the computer said. “It depends upon finding about three liters of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">red plasma type two. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What’s that?”<br>“It’s what the computer runs on.”<br>“Like gasoline?”<br>“Not exactly,” the computer said. “It is actually a psycholubricant needed by the inferential circuits</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">to plot their probabilistic courses.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Couldn’t we do without it?”<br>“In order to do what?”<br>“To fly out of here!” Hellman exploded. “ Are you getting dense or something?”<br>“There are too many hidden assumptions in your speech,” the computer said.<br>“Go to ramble mode,” Hellman said.<br>“I hate the inexactness of it. Why don’t you let me tell you exactly what is wrong and how it could</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">be fixed.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Ramble mode,” Hellman commanded again.<br>“All right. “ The robot sighed. “You want to get back in your spaceship and get out of here. You</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">want me to fix things up so that you can get out of here. But as you know, I am under the law of robotics<br>which says that I may not, either wittingly or unwittingly, harm you. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Getting me out of here won’t harm me,” Hellman said.<br>“You rented this spaceship and went out into space seeking your fortune, is that not correct?”<br>“Yeah, so what?”<br>“A fortune is sitting right here waiting for you and all you can think is how to get away from it as</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">quickly as possible.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What fortune? What are you talking about?”<br>“First of all, you haven’t checked the environment readings, even though I have put them up on the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">screen for you. You will have already noticed that we are at approximately Earth pressure. The readings<br>further tell us that this is an oxygen-rich planet and as such could be valuable for Earth colonization. That<br>is the first possibility of wealth that you have overlooked.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Tell me the second one.”</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Unless I miss my guess,” the computer said, “this planet may yield an answer to the Desdemona</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">disaster. You know as well as I that there is a fortune in rewards for whoever discovers the whereabouts<br>of the conspirators.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“You think the Desdemona robots could have come here?”<br>“Precisely.”<br>“But why do you think that?”<br>“Because I have scanned the horizon in all directions and have found no less than three loci of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">mechanical life, each moving independently of each other and without, as far as I can detect, a human<br>operator involved.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman went to the nearest perplex port. Looking out he could see a flat featureless prairie</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">stretching onward monotonously for as far as he could see. Nothing moved on it.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“There’s nothing there,” he told the computer.<br>“Your senses aren’t sufficiently acute. I assure you, they are there.”<br>“Robots, huh?”<br>“They fit the definition.”.<br>“And you think they could be from the Desdemona?”<br>“The evidence pointing that way is persuasive. What other intelligent robots are unaccounted for?”<br>Hellman considered for a moment. “This might be a suitable place for Earth colonization and the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">answer to the Desdemona mystery. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“The thought had not escaped my attention. “<br>“Is the air out there breathable?”<br>“Yes. I find no bacterial complications, either. You’ll probably leave some if you go out there.”<br>“That’s not my problem,” Hellman said. He hummed to himself as he changed into suitable</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">exploration clothes: khakis, a bush jacket, desert boots, and a holstered laser pistol. He said to the<br>computer, “I assume that you can fix whatever’s wrong with us? I’ll even plug in your extension arm if<br>that’ll help.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“I suppose I can devise a way,” the computer said. “But even if not, we’re not stranded. The radio</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">is functioning perfectly. I could send out a signal now on a subchannel radio and somebody might send a<br>rescue ship.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Not yet,” Hellman said. “I don’t want anyone else here just yet messing up my rights.”<br>“What rights?”<br>“Discoverer of this planet and solver of the Desdemona mystery. As a matter of fact, disconnect the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">radio. We don’t want anyone fooling with it.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Were you expecting guests?” the computer asked.<br>“Not exactly. It’s just that you and I are going out there to check up on things. “<br>“I can’t be moved!” the computer said in alarm.<br>“Of course not. I’ll maintain a radio link with you. There may be material for you to analyze.”<br>“You’re going out there to talk to robots?”<br>“That’s the idea.”<br>“Let me remind you that the Desdemona robots are believed to have broken the laws of robotics.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">They are believed capable of harming man, either by advertence or inadvertence. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“That’s old science fiction,” Hellman said. “It is well known that robots don’t hurt people. Only</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">people hurt people. Robots are rational. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“That’s not the consensus as to what happened at Desdemona.”<br>“There is no case in the annals of robotics,” Hellman said, “of a human being attacked willfully and</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">with intention by a robot. It has never happened.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“This could be the first time,” the computer said.</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I can take care of myself,” Hellman said.<br>The air was fresh and clean outside the spaceship. There was short grass under his feet, springy and</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">tough and scented faintly of thyme and rosemary. Hellman held up the walkie-talkie and clicked it on. “<br>Are you reading me?” he asked the computer.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“You’re coming over loud and clear,” the computer said. “Roger, breaker, over to you.”<br>“Don’t be such a wise guy,” Hellman said. “What sort of a freak programmed you, anyhow?”<br>“You must be referring to my irony circuit. It was put in especially for my model. “<br>“Well, turn it off.”<br>“Manual lock. You’ll have to do it yourself.”<br>“When I get back,” Hellman said. “You still got those machines on your radar?”<br>“It’s not radar,” the computer said. “Two of the machines are now traveling away from you. One is</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">still moving toward you.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“How soon should I be able to see it?”<br>“Calculating the two trajectories, and assuming there’s no change in either of your directions, and no</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">other untoward event occurs, I would say, in the vague terms you prefer, that it ought to be quite soon.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman moved on. He could see now that the plain was not as flat as he had thought when he</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">looked at it from the ship. It dipped and rose and fell, and there were low hills in the near distance, or<br>perhaps they were sand dunes. Hellman was getting a little winded now. He had failed to keep up with<br>his aerobics during the spaceship flight and was a trifle out of condition. All this climbing up and down,<br>even on little hills, could take its toll. As he moved along he heard, just slightly louder than his own<br>labored breath, the low chuffing on an engine.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I can hear him!” he told the computer.<br>“I should think so. My receptors picked him up long ago.”<br>“Good for you. But where is he?”<br>“He’s about ten or fifteen feet from you and slightly to your left. “<br>“Why can’t I see him?”<br>“Because he is taking advantage of the cover afforded by a fold in the earth. “<br>“Why would he want to do that?”<br>“It is consonant with stalking behavior,” the computer said.<br>“What makes you think—” Hellman stopped in midword. The sound of the machine’s engine had</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">suddenly gone off.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What’s he doing now?”<br>“He has turned off his main engine. He is on battery power now for silent running. “,<br>Hellman drew the laser pistol. For the first time he considered the problem of trying to bring down a</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">large and perhaps ferocious machine with such a weapon. It takes time for even a hot laser to burn<br>through metal. It takes time to get through deep enough to hit a vital connection, or the microprocessor<br>itself. But if the machine were feral, if it really intended him harm, it could be on him before he could bring<br>it down. Unless he could hit a vital spot on the first shot.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What’s a vital spot in a robot?” Hellman asked the computer.<br>“Depends on what kind. Different kinds carry their vital gear in different compartments. So a head</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">shot is not necessarily advisable. It might be best if you tried to reason with him. “,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Why are we calling it ‘he’?”<br>“Because some of us are nervous,” the computer said.<br>Hellman looked around. The ground where he was now afforded many places where a determined</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">robot of not too great size could conceal himself. Hellman stopped and’ looked around. He had the<br>feeling that whatever was stalking him had stopped, too. He moved on, because it made him less<br>nervous. There was a kind of hush over the land. Hellman had the impression that the grasses were<br>waiting to see what would happen. He decided he’d better find himself some shelter. If this robot was a</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">bad one, at least he could make a stand.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">He saw a natural outcropping of rock which leaned close to a low granite shelf. It looked like a</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">pretty good spot. He hurried there and put himself on the other side of the rocks. Then he breathed a sigh<br>of relief and turned around to survey his surroundings.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">The robot was behind him, about eight feet away. Hellman was frozen with shock.<br>The robot had so much detail that Hellman found it difficult to make out its general shape. It was</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">roughly rectangular, made of open-frame construction, like an Erector set, with a solid metal box about<br>two feet to a side bolted to its interior. Wires ran from this box to its various parts. Hellman couldn’t<br>decide at first if it moved with legs or wheels. He decided that the machine used both. It was like a<br>cagework rectangle standing on end and tilted forward. This was a typical stance among this group of<br>robots, he was later to find out. It seemed to have two operational centers, because there was another<br>central box, smaller and higher up. This, he learned later, housed gearing. Two photoelectric eyes<br>extended on stalks and swiveled down to see him. Trumpet-shaped ears swiveled in synch with the eyes.<br>The machine stood about ten feet tall. It reminded Hellman of a living motorcycle.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Hi, there,” Hellman said brightly. “I am Tom Hellman and I come from the planet Earth. Who are</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">you?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The robot continued to look at him. Hellman had the impression it was taking him in, trying to</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">decide something.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">Finally it said, “Never mind about that. What are you doing here?”<br>“I just came by for a visit,” Hellman said. “Got my spaceship right over there.”<br>“You’d better get back to it,” the robot said. “Stay here; you got trouble. There’s a pack of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">hyenoids coming after you.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Hyenoids? What’s that?”<br>“Scavengers. Eat anything. You too if they can.”<br>“Thanks for the tip,” Hellman said. “It’s been nice talking to you. I guess I’d better get back.”<br>Then he heard it. A low snuffling sound to his right, then a piercing bark to his left.<br>“Too late now,” the robot said.<br>Hellman whirled around and saw the first hyenoids. They were small open-framework machines, no</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">more than three feet high by about four feet long. They raced along on six mechanical legs, and they had<br>wheels too, lifted up now out of drive position. They were coming toward him, but not directly. They<br>were slinking like hyenas were said to do, darting this way and that, taking cover behind clumps of rock<br>and folds of earth. Hellman counted four of them. They were circling him, moving ever closer.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Do they eat people?” Hellman asked.<br>“Anything at all, that’s what they like.”<br>“Help me!” Hellman asked.<br>The robot hesitated. Its photoelectric eyes flashed red and green. Hellman noticed for the first time</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">that the robot had a long articulated tail. It was curling and uncurling now.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Well,” the robot said, “I don’t have much to do with humans. I’m a carhunter. We stay by</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">ourselves.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Please, help! Get me out of here!” Hellman switched on the radio and said to the ship’s computer,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">“Can you reason with this machine?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">There was a short burst of static. The computer was signaling the carhunter. There was brief</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">electrical activity, then silence, then more static.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I don’t know,” the carhunter said. “Your keeper says you’re all right...<br>“My what? Oh, you mean the computer.” Hellman was going to put the robot straight as to who</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">was boss and who was servant between him and the computer, but thought better of it. He needed this<br>machine’s help just now, and if it pleased him to think that Hellman was kept by the computer, that was<br>okay with him, at least until he was in a stronger position.</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“But why did the computer send you out here?” the robot asked. “He must have known it would be</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">dangerous.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Oh, well, it’s an old tradition with us,” Hellman said. “I check out the territory for the computer. I</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">work as one of his extensions, if you know what I mean. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">The robot pondered that for a while. Then he said, “It sounds like a good system.”<br>The hyenoids were growing bolder. They were circling Hellman and the robot openly now. Their</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">low-slung open-girderwork bodies had been painted in green, gray, and tan stripes, camouflage colors.<br>There seemed no reason for them to have such large jaws with stainless steel teeth in them. Who would<br>build a robot that fueled itself on the carcasses of animals it killed?</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">One of them, jaws open and slavering a viscous green liquid, was edging toward Hellman now.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Hellman held the laser pistol in front of him, trying to sight on a vital component. He figured they probably<br>had redundant backup systems, stands to reason if you’re making a carnivorous model. The wear and<br>tear would be tremendous. Not so much as on its victims, but plenty anyhow.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Better get up on me,” the carhunter said.<br>Hellman scrambled over to the carhunter and pulled himself up its open-framework sides, straddling</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">its back where it came to a kind of peak.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Hang on,” the carhunter said, and broke into a loping run, its six legs giving it a curious but not</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">uncomfortable gait. Hellman held on tightly. The speed wasn’t so. great—perhaps fifteen to twenty miles<br>an hour. But to falloff would leave him helpless against the pursuing pack of hyenoids.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The hyenoids followed them through the broken country, and even managed to gain, since tight</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">maneuvering in the little ravines and canyons was easier for the smaller, more agile beasts. One of them<br>got close enough to take a nip at the carhunter. The carhunter extruded a long supple limb and flipped the<br>hyenoid over on its back. The rest of the pack gave them more space after seeing that. The overturned<br>one soon righted itself and came up again in pursuit, staying well out of reach of the carhunter’s limb. It<br>reminded Hellman of pictures he had seen in a museum, of wolves trying to bring down a wounded elk.<br>Only the carhunter was much more self-assured than any elk. He seemed to have no fear of the hyenoids.<br>After a while they crossed a muddy little river, and then they were on a flat, hard-tamped plain. Here the<br>carhunter could put down his wheels and engage his superior horsepower. Soon he had left the hyenoids<br>far behind, and they turned back. Seeing this, the carhunter shifted to a more economical cruising speed.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Say when,” he said to Hellman after a while.<br>“What do you mean, say when?”<br>“Tell me when you want me to drop you off.”<br>“Are you crazy?” Hellman asked. “We must be twenty miles from my spaceship. “<br>“Your spaceship?”<br>It was too late for Hellman to retrieve the slip. “Yeah,” he said. “I’m afraid I gave you the wrong</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">impression back there. Actually the computer works for me.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The carhunter slowed and came to a stop. There was nothing on all sides of them, and it stretched</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">on forever.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Well, that’s an interesting twist,” the carhunter said. “Is that how it works where you come from?”<br>“Well, yeah, pretty much,” Hellman said. “Look, would you do me a great favor and take me back</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">to my spaceship.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“No. Can’t.”<br>“Why not?”<br>“I’m late already for the meeting.”<br>“A meeting? Is It really so important?”<br>“It’s a tribal matter. It’s the only really important date in the carhunter year. It takes precedence</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">over any other contingency. Sorry, but I just have time to make it if I proceed immediately.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Take me with you.”</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“To our meeting?”<br>“I’ll wait outside. I’m not trying to spy on you or anything. I just need to go somewhere until you or</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">somebody can take me back to my ship.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The carhunter thought about it. “‘Ethics are not my strong point,” he said, “but I suppose that</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">abandoning you to your death out here when I could without too much difficulty do something about it<br>would be pretty unconscionable; is that correct?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Perfectly correct.”<br>“It takes a human being to point out that sort of thing. All I was thinking of was the extra energy I’d</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">have to expend to save your life. I mean, what’s in it for me? That’s the way we start to think when<br>there’s not a human around. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I’m glad we can be useful to you,” Hellman said.<br>“But you’re also extremely difficult to be around. Always tinkering with software. Don’t you think</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">there’s enough uncertainty on the subatomic level without introducing it into our macro dealings?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What?” Hellman said.<br>“Never mind, I’m just raving. When you are a carhunter, you spend a lot of time alone. It’s a</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">nomadic life, you know. Most of us live apart from each other. Hunting cars. That’s what we do. That’s<br>why we’re called carhunters.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Oh. What kind of cars do you hunt?”<br>“All kinds. We’re carnivores, in our limited way. We eat cars. We also eat trucks and half-tracks,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">but they’ve been getting rare in these parts. People say the half-tracks are about hunted out. Yet my<br>father could tell you about herds of them that stretched from hill to hill as far as the eye could see. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Not like that any more, I suppose,” Hellman said, trying to fall in with the carhunter’s mood.<br>“You got that right. Not that it’s too difficult to stay fed, especially now, in summer. I got me a fat</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">old Studebaker just two days ago. You’ll find a couple of its carburetors and headlights in the bin under<br>you and to your left.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman could peer down through the metal wickerwork and see, in an open-topped metal box,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">headlights and carburetors half submerged in crankcase oil.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Looks pretty good, don’t it? I know you don’t eat metal yourself, but no doubt you can empathize</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">the experience.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“They look tasty,” Hellman said. “Especially in all that oil.”<br>“Twice-used crankcase oil. Ain’t nothing like it. I’ve spiced it up a bit with a plant that grows</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">hereabouts. We call it the chili pepper.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Yes, we have something like it, too,” Hellman said.<br>“Damn small galaxy,” the carhunter said. “By the way, I’m Wayne 1332A.”<br>“Tom Hellman,” Hellman said.<br>“Pleased to meet you. Settle yourself in and take a good grip. We’re going to the meeting.“<br>The carhunter broke into a stride, then, lowering wheels, built up speed across the flat face of the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">desert. But soon he slowed again.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What’s the matter?” Hellman asked.<br>“Are you sure I’m doing the right thing, saving your life?”<br>“I’m absolutely sure,” Hellman said. “You need have no doubts over that. “<br>“I just wanted to be sure,” Wayne said. “ Anyway, it’s best to let the others decide what to do with</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">you. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">Wayne 1332A started to pick up speed again.<br>“What do you mean, do with me?”<br>“You might be a problem for us, Tom. But I have to let the others decide. Now I need to</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">concentrate.”</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">They had reached another part of the plain. It was strewn with gigantic boulders. The carhunter</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">needed all his skill to dodge around them at the high speed he was maintaining. Let the others decide.<br>Hellman hadn’t liked the sound of that at all. Nothing much he could do about it at present, however.<br>And anyhow, maybe the robots at the meeting wouldn’t be so difficult.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The sunlight had faded as they roared out of the rocky plain and into a region of low, steep hills.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">There was a rudimentary track leading up. Wayne took it as if he were a dirt-bike hill climber. Dirt, sand,<br>and gravel showered Hellman as the carhunter dodged and slashed and braked and accelerated up the<br>increasingly steep hill. At last Wayne’s wheels began to skid and he had to retract them and go entirely<br>by pseudopod power. Hellman had to hold on extra tight, because the robot was shaking and quivering<br>and lurching and swerving, and sometimes all of them at the same time.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">Then Wayne slewed to a sudden halt.<br>Hellman said, “What is it?”<br>“Lookee over there.”<br>Hellman’s gaze followed the LED lights along one of the carhunter’s main support members. Off to</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">one side, on a rough but serviceable road, a dusty old Mercedes 300 SL was moving sedately along.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Ain’t that a beauty!” Wayne said.<br>Hellman looked and didn’t like the prospect of the carhunter hurling itself at this burly and</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">self-reliant automobile on this hillside with its deeply tilted slant and its uneasy footing. One slip, and he<br>and the carhunter would be at the bottom of the hill after rolling all the way. Maybe the carhunter could<br>recover from that, but Hellman doubted a human could.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Hell, it’s just a car,” Hellman said. “Let’s get to the meeting, huh?”<br>“That car is prime eating, and if you don’t want it I can sure use it.”<br>“Let’s eat latf;r, at the meeting.”<br>“Idiot, the meeting is a time of fasting. Why do you think I need a snack now?”<br>“Computer!” Hellman said, turning on the radio link he had managed to hold on to through</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">everything, probably because it was attached to his wrist by a lanyard.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Out of range,” the carhunter said. “Relax, I been gittin’ cars on worse terrain than this. Hang on,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">baby, here we got”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">He started down the perilous slope. It was strange that at this time, just before the irrevocable</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">launch into dangerous territory, Hellman should think of the Desdemona mystery. On the other hand,<br>maybe it wasn’t strange at all.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Desdemona was a satellite out past Neptune orbit. It was a dreary little place, a settlement of no</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">more than a few hundred members of a now forgotten religious sect who had gone to this place to<br>preserve their beliefs without contamination from the rest of the world. They</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">had taken their robots with them, of course; you couldn’t survive in the outer planets without robots</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">and a lot of luck. They had been gatherers of Xeum, cosmic-ray residue. Due to topological peculiarities<br>in the spacetime continuum, Desdemona happened to receive more Xeum than any other place in the<br>solar system. But it was a bare living, because the only demand for Xeum was from scientists who were<br>trying to find the primordial substance which generated the ultimate particle.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The settlers of Desdemona were sober people who kept only the most minimal contact with the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">other worlds. Still, they couldn’t isolate themselves entirely. There were stirrings, undercurrents, and a<br>growing demand for new products and new ways. Some of the Desdemona citizens took to spending<br>time at Ganymede Fun World, the pleasure satellite that had been erected in Jupiter orbit. It was a long<br>way to go for a little fun, but go they did.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">There was dissension on Desdemona. And then, one day, a blurry and hard-to-read signal was</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">received on Earth and other worlds. No one could decipher it, but it seemed to refer to some disaster. A<br>relief party was sent out and found Desdemona satellite deserted. The place had been dismantled in an<br>orderly fashion, all useful material packed away and taken. The only hint of what had happened was a<br>letter, begun and crumpled and thrown into a corner and there ignored in the general housecleaning that</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">preceded the departure. After some chit-chat about family and friends, there was this: “Our robots have<br>been giving us difficulties of late, and we’re not sure what to do about it. The Elders say there’s no<br>danger of a revolt, though some doubt the wisdom of the new override instructions that permit our robots<br>to get around the Three Laws of Robotics. Our Chairman says this is necessary in order not to inhibit<br>their intellectual development, but some of us wonder if we aren’t asking for a lot of trouble—”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">At that point the letter ended in mid-sentence.<br>There was conjecture that the robots, freed of the restraints of the Laws of Robotics, had somehow</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">taken control and decided to take the spaceships, and the humans from Desdemona, and go somewhere<br>else, a place where they would not be molested by the rest of humanity. It was theoretically possible to<br>bypass the robotics laws; intelligent robots started their life with neutral ethical values. Moral defaults and<br>restraints had to be built in and programmed. Not everyone agreed with this program. Some people had<br>toyed with their robots’ conditioning, hoping to get more out of the robots. Instances of this were rare,<br>however, and were stamped out as soon as they were encountered.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Large rewards were offered for anyone who solved the Desdemona mystery, and even larger</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">rewards were available for anyone who discovered the present location of the Desdemona robots and<br>their owners, the humans of Desdemona Settlement. No one had claimed this money so far, although<br>there had been one or two false alarms.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman was pretty sure that the Desdemona robots had come to this place, whatever this planet</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">was called. He was potentially a rich man. The only difficulty was, he was at present clinging to the side<br>of a carhunter which was rushing down a slope to attack a Mercedes 300 SL.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Slipping and sliding on the rocky surface, the carhunter, wheels spinning, limbs struggling for</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">purchase, came down on the hapless automobile. The Mercedes, sensing the attack at the last moment,<br>put on a burst of speed. The carhunter was able to claw away a portion of its bumper before the<br>Mercedes pulled free, and, with a snort from its double carbs, hurtled down the slope. The carhunter<br>followed, caught up, and launched itself onto the back of the car. There was a wild bellowing from both<br>machines. Then the carhunter had landed on the trunk of the Mercedes and was tearing and rending it,<br>trying, with its long extensible arms, to reach under and break loose one of the vulnerable axles in order<br>to hamstring the mechanical beast. But the Mercedes had armored side panels and a mesh of steel<br>protected its vital organs. Its horn blared and from its modified supercharger ports came a blue-gray gas.<br>The carhunter managed to pinch shut the main port out of which these fumes were rising. Extruding a<br>metallic tentacle with a bludgeon-like steel fist at its end, it beat in the car’s side window and grabbed at<br>the steering wheel. The car and the carhunter struggled for control as they careened across the steep<br>hillside, coming perilously close to capsizing. This was prevented only by the carhunter’s superior sense<br>of balance, for he managed somehow to keep both himself and the Mercedes upright on its wheels. The<br>groans and snarls, screams and gruntings were impressive in the extreme. Hellman was battered back<br>and forth as the two robots clashed, and thought for a moment he was going to be thrown free. And then,<br>suddenly, it was over. The robothunter’s tentacle snaked through an entry port and found the creature’s<br>central processing unit somewhere deep in its innards. The carhunter wrenched, once, twice, and on the<br>third try a thick bunch of cables came loose and the Mercedes uttered a single sigh and slowed to a halt.<br>The idiot lights on its dashboard flashed in crazy patterns, then went to black. The creature was dead.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman managed to slide to the ground. He stretched himself and rested while Wayne stripped out</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">the points and munched them, then dismantled the machine and stored some of the choicer parts in its<br>cargo section just beneath its own CPU. Watching him, Hellman became aware that he was getting<br>hungry, too.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“I don’t suppose you have anything that I can eat?” Hellman asked, as he watched Wayne slaver as</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">it munched down one headlight.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Not here, no,” Wayne said. “But at the meeting we’ll be able to do something for you. “<br>“I don’t eat metal, you know,” Hellman said. “Not even plastic. “<br>“I am aware of humans’ special dietary requirements,” the carhunter replied. He spit out a couple of</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">lug nuts. “Well, that was delicious. Too bad you humans don’t know about headlights. Come on, mount<br>up, we’ll be late.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Through no fault of mine,” Hellman muttered, climbing onto the carhunter again.<br>In another hour they had left the desolate badlands and were traveling across grassy rolling country.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">There was a river to their right, and green rolling hills to the left. So far Hellman had not seen any signs of<br>human, or even animal, life. There was plenty of vegetation around here, however. Most of it seemed to<br>be in the form of trees and grass. Nothing there for him to eat. But perhaps something would turn up<br>when they reached the meeting place.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Far ahead, in a cleft between two hills, he caught sight of a glint of sunlight off metal. “What’s that?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">he asked.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“That’s the Roundhouse,” Wayne said. “That’s what we call the Great Meeting Hall. And look.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Some of the others are there already. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The Roundhouse was a circular building, one story high, open to the weather and supported on</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">pillars. It was nicely landscaped with big trees and shrubbery. There were perhaps twenty machines<br>milling around outside. Hellman could hear their engines idling before he could make out the words they<br>were saying to each other. Behind the Roundhouse was a fenced enclosure. Here there were several<br>enormous mechanical creatures of a kind Hellman had not seen before. They towered above the<br>carhunters, looking like mechanical renditions of brontosaurus. Close to their enclosure there were<br>various other structures.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">As Wayne approached, the carhunters spotted Hellman on his back and fell silent. Wayne coasted</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">to a stop near them.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Howdy, Jeff,” Wayne said. “Si, Bill, Skeeter, hello.”<br>“Hello, Wayne,” they replied.<br>“I reckon you can get down now,” Wayne said to Hellman.<br>Hellman slid down the carhunter’s back. It felt good to have solid ground beneath him again, though</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">he was a little intimidated by the size of the other carhunters.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What you got there, Wayne?” one of them asked.<br>“You can see for yourself,” Wayne said. “It’s a human.”<br>“Well, so it is,” the machine called Jeff replied. “Haven’t seen one of them critters around for a long</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">time.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“They’re getting pretty scarce, “ Wayne agreed. “ Anything to drink around here?”<br>One of the carhunters pointed one of his extensors at a forty-gallon barrel which had been put aside</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">under one of the trees. “Try some of that. Some of Lester’s home brew he sent along. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Isn’t Lester going to make it?”<br>“Afraid not. He’s got that rot of the control cables; it’s got him crippled up pretty good.”<br>Wayne went over to the barrel. He extruded a tube and inserted it into the barrel. The others</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">watched silently as the level of the barrel went down.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Hey, Wayne! Save some for somebody else!”<br>Wayne finally withdrew his drinking tube. “Yahoo!” he said. “Got a kick, that stuff.”<br>“Three hundred proof and flavored with cinnamon. Human, you want to try some?”<br>“I guess I’ll pass on it,” Hellman said. The carhunters guffawed rudely.<br>“Where in the hell did you find him, Wayne?”<br>“Out on the prairie,” Wayne said...His owner is still out there in the spaceship. “<br>“Why didn’t he come along?”<br>“Don’t rightly know. Might not be mobile.”<br>“What’re you going to do with him?”<br>“That’s for the Executive Council to decide,” Wayne said.</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Does he talk?” the one called Skeeter asked. “Sure, I talk,” Hellman said.<br>Hellman was about to put this smart-alecky robot straight. But then there was a movement within</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">the Roundhouse and two robots came out. Their open framework struts and girders were painted blue;<br>their upper part was red. They had black symbols painted here and there. They seemed to be officials of<br>some sort.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“The Chief sent us,” one of them said to Wayne. “He heard you came into camp with a human.”<br>“News gets around fast, don’t it?” Wayne said.<br>“Wayne, you know that’s against the rules.”<br>Wayne shook his big head. “It’s not customary, but I never heard it was against the rules.”<br>“Well, it is. We’ll have to take him inside for interrogation.”<br>“Figured as much,” Wayne said.<br>“Come with us, human,” one of the officials said.<br>There didn’t seem to be anything for Hellman to do but follow orders. He knew he was no match</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">for the robots in speed or strength. He’d have to keep his wits about him. It might not be too easy to<br>come out of this one okay.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">What really perplexed him, however, was, what did these robots have against human beings? How</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">had they developed in this way? Were there any humans at all on this planet? Or had the robots killed<br>them all?</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">One of the buildings seemed to serve the carhunters as a prison. Its sides were closed. It had a</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">door, which had a padlock. One of the red and blue officials or guards or whatever they were unlocked<br>the door and held it open for Hellman.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“How long you going to lock me up for?” Hellman asked.<br>“You will be informed of the council’s decisions.” They closed the door behind him.<br>It was a large room made of galvanized iron. There were windows set high up. There was no glass</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">in them. The room was devoid of furniture. Evidently robots didn’t use chairs or beds. There were a few<br>low metal tables. Hellman looked around, and, as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom, he made<br>out a wink of lights from one corner. He went there to investigate.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">There was a robot in the corner. It was somewhat smaller than a man, perhaps five feet high. And it</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">was slender. It had a well-defined head sculpted from some bright metal, and the usual arms and legs.<br>The creature watched him silently, and that was a little unnerving.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Hi,” Hellman said. “I’m Tom Hellman. Who are you?”<br>The robot didn’t reply.<br>“Can’t you talk?” Hellman asked. “Don’t you speak English?”<br>Still no reply from the robot, who continued to watch him with one red and one green eye.<br>“Great,” Hellman said. “They put me in with a dummy. “<br>As he spoke, he noticed that the robot was scratching in the dirt of the packed earth floor with a</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">long toe. Hellman read it: “The walls have ears.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">He looked at the robot. It gave him a meaningful look.<br>“What happens now?” Hellman said, dropping his voice to a whisper. The robot scratched, “We’ll</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">know soon.” The robot didn’t want to communicate any further. Hellman went to the far side of the room<br>and stretched out on the floor. He was very hungry now. Were they going to feed him? And more<br>important, were they going to feed him something he could eat? Outside, it was growing late. After a<br>while, Hellman started to doze off. He fell into a light sleep, and soon he was dreaming of vague,<br>threatening things that came at him out of a dark sky. He was trying to explain to them that he was not to,<br>blame, but he couldn’t remember what for.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman awoke when the door to the prison was opened. At first he thought they had come to tell</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">him what they had decided. But they had brought him food instead. It consisted entirely of fruit and nuts.<br>None of them was familiar to him, but none were strange, either. They also brought him water. It was</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">carried in quart oil cans which had been scrupulously cleansed and bore not even a trace of oil. Hellman<br>learned later that these cans had never held oil, even though “oil” was stamped into the metal of their<br>sides. He had no idea then that the carhunters had a ceremonial side to their nature, and were able to use<br>certain utilitarian objects for their symbolic value alone.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The two carhunters who brought the food and water would answer no questions. They waited</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">silently while Hellman ate. He thought they watched him with curiosity. He couldn’t figure that out, but he<br>was hungry enough so that he ate anyway. They took away the hammered tin plates on which they had<br>brought the food, but they left him two water cans.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Time passed. Hellman had no watch, and was unable to reach the ship’s computer to get a time</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">check. But he figured that hours must have passed. He grew irritated with the robot who was locked in<br>with him, who sat in a corner of the room and seemed to be in a cataleptic fit.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">At last Hellman had had enough. Boredom can drive a man to outrageous deeds. He walked over</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">to the robot and said, “Say something.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The robot opened its red and green eyes and looked at him. It slowly shook its head, left to right,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">meaning no.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Because they can hear us, right?”<br>The robot nodded, affirmative.<br>“What does it matter if they can hear us or not?”<br>The robot made a complex and intricate gesture with its hands, which Hellman took to mean, ‘You</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">just don’t understand.’</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I just don’t understand, is that it?” Hellman asked.<br>The robot nodded, affirmative.<br>“But I can’t understand unless you tell me.”<br>The robot shrugged. Universal gesture meaning, what can I do about it?<br>“I’ll tell you what you can do,” Hellman said, his voice low but resonant with suppressed anger.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">“You listening?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">The robot nodded.<br>“If you don’t start talking at once, I’m going to put out one of your eyes. The green one. Then ask</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">you again. If you refuse again, I’ll put out the red one. Got it?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The robot stared at him. Only now did Hellman see what a mobile face it had. It was not made up</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">of a single piece of metal. Instead there were many little planes sculptured into the face, and each plane<br>was about an inch square and seemed capable of movement. This was a face designed to reveal its<br>thoughts, feelings, and moods through its face. And sure enough, the robot’s face registered horror,<br>disbelief, outrage,, as Hellman screwed up his own face into a ferocious frown and advanced.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“There’s no need for violence,” the robot said.<br>“Fine. There’s no reason for silence either, is there?”<br>“I suppose not,” the robot said. “I just thought it best that we didn’t talk together so that the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">carhunters wouldn’t get the idea we were plotting against them.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Why would they think that?”<br>“You must know as well as I do that it’s every sentient being for itself here on this planet of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Newstart. And the carhunters are a very suspicious group of people.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“They’re not people,” Hellman said. “They’re robots.”<br>“Since intelligent robots have the same faculties as humans, we no longer differentiate between them</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">in terms of ’robot’ and ‘human.’ It’s superfluous and racist to talk that way. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“All right,” Hellman said. “I stand corrected. You say they are suspicious people?”<br>“Stands to reason, doesn’t it? They have separated themselves from the mainstream of Newstart life</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">and development. Isolated groups tend toward xenophobia.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“You know a lot of big words,” Hellman said. “I ought to. I’m a librarian.”</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“These carhunters don’t look like they have much use for reading.”<br>“I’m not a librarian here,” the robot said with a low laugh. “I don’t belong to this tribe! I work at the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Central Lending Library in downtown Robotsville. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Robotsville? Is that a city?”<br>“The largest city on Newstart. Surely you’ve heard of it?”<br>“I’m not from here,” Hellman said. “I’m from the planet Earth. “<br>“You ‘re from another planet?” The robot sat up and looked at Hellman more attentively. “How did</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">you get here?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“In the usual way. By spaceship.”<br>“Uhuu,” the robot said.<br>“Beg pardon?”<br>“‘Uhuu’ is an expression peculiar to Robotsville. It means ‘that really opens up a lot of possibilities.’</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">“</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Can you explain that?” Hellman asked.<br>“It’s just that quite a lot is happening on Newstart right now. Your arrival could have incalculable</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">consequences.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What are you talking about? What’s going on?”<br>Just then there was the sound of a key in the lock.<br>“I’m afraid I’m not going to have time to tell you,” the robot said. “God knows what these</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">barbarians have in store for us. My name is Jorge.” He gave it the Spanish pronunciation, Hor-hay.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Jorge? As in Jorge Luis Borges?” asked Hellman, a literate man when it came to very short stories.<br>“Yes. He is the saint of librarians.”<br>The door opened. Two carhunters lumbered in. Around buildings they seemed clumsy and ill at</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">ease. The fluid grace that a carhunter possessed in the countryside seemed to have deserted them in<br>these restricting surroundings.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Come with us,” one of them said. “The council has discussed you and now will speak with you.”<br>“What about my buddy Jorge here?”<br>“He will be dealt with in due time.”<br>“Be careful what you say to them,” the librarian said. “The carhunters do not like...prevarication.”<br>The librarian’s pause was long enough to convince Hellman that there was something he was being</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">advised not to say to the carhunters. He wished he knew what it was. But now the carhunters were<br>moving, and Hellman had to move quickly to prevent being run over.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">They led him to the meeting area. It was a flat circular rock face that had been roughly smoothed. It</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">stood about three feet above the ground, and there were ramps of packed earth leading up to it. The<br>carhunters had already assembled. They were moving around the rock, which greatly resembled a large<br>parking lot. In the center was a raised cube. On it there were five or so carhunters. These looked more<br>like a bunch of politicians than anything else.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman was led to a large pedestal with a spiral roadway leading up to it. It put him on eye level</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">with the five top carhunters.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Even if they had not been apart from the others, Hellman would have had no difficulty telling that</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">these were the important ones. They were somewhat larger than the others, and their bodies had more<br>ornamentation, mostly of the chromium variety. Several of them wore necklaces of shiny objects which<br>Hellman recognized as hood designs from automobiles of Earth ‘s past.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The leading carhunter was easy to spot, too. He sat in the center of the others on the raised</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">rectangle. He was almost a third larger than his fellow judges, and he was painted a midnight blue with<br>silver accents.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The blue and silver judge said, “I am Car Eater, Chief Elder of the Carhunters tribe. These are my</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">fellow judges. Why have you come here, Tom Hellman? We already know that you came in a spaceship.</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Why did you come to Newstart?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“It was a mistake,” Hellman said. “I had a malfunction.”<br>“That is not an acceptable answer. Where humans are concerned, there are no mistakes.”<br>“Maybe you don’t know people very well,” Hellman said. “This was definitely a mistake. If you</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">don’t believe me, ask my ship’s computer.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“One of our scouts tried to talk to him “ Car Eater said. “He told us we did not have the proper</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">access code. He would not explain what he meant by that.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“The access code is a nine-number combination. It is used to prevent unauthorized spying on the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">computer’s memory banks.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“But couldn’t the computer make up his own mind about that?” Car Eater asked.<br>“Perhaps he could,” Hellman said. “But it is not the way we do things on Earth.”<br>The robots held a whispered conference. Then Car Eater said, “It has been many years since a</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">human visited these parts. This part of the planet belongs to us, the carhunters. We stay out of other<br>people’s territory and expect people to stay out of ours. This is how it has been for a very long time, ever<br>since the Great Fabricator divided the species of intelligence and told each to be fruitful and multiply<br>according to his basic plan. Some of the carhunters wanted to kill you, and that other stray too, the<br>librarian who calls himself Jorge. Sounds like a sissy name to me. That’s the sort of name they give<br>themselves in Robotsville, where they think they’re better than anyone else. But we Elders decided<br>against taking violent action. The Compact which rules this planet abhors destruction except in lawful<br>ways. Hellman, you may go. You and Jorge, too. I advise you to be out of our territory by sundown.<br>Otherwise a hyenoid might get you. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Where am I supposed to go? I can’t get back to my spaceship on my own. “<br>“Since Wayne 1332A brought you here,” Car Eater said, “he can also take you back. Right,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Wayne?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">A loud sound of backfires came from the assembled carhunters. It took Hellman a moment to</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">realize it was laughter.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Sorry about this, Wayne,” Hellman said. He and Jorge had mounted and were clinging to the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">carhunter’s back plates.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Hell, it don’t make no never mind,” Wayne said. “I don’t sit around a whole lot fretting about how</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">I pass my time. Sometimes it’s more convenient for us carhunters to turn onto emergency mode, which of<br>course is timebound. But most of the time life just goes along here on the concrete prairie much as it has<br>ever done.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman learned from Wayne that the carhunters had lived in this region, the badlands of Northwest</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Mountain and Concrete Prairie, for as long as anyone could remember. Jorge broke in and said that this<br>was a lie, or at least an untruth: the carhunters had been around only a hundred years or so, just like<br>everyone else. Wayne said he didn’t want to argue, but he did point out that there was one hell of a lot<br>city robots didn’t know. Hellman himself was interested in what it was like to be a city robot.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Aren’t there any people in your city?” Hellman asked Jorge.<br>“I told you, all of us are people.”<br>“Well, I mean people like me. Humans. Flesh-and-blood sort of people. You know what I mean?”<br>“If you mean natural human beings, no. There are none in Robotsville. We separated from them. It</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">was for the good of everyone. Just didn’t get along. We tried producing flesh-and-blood androids for a<br>while—robots with protoplasmic bodies. But it was aesthetically unpleasing.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I didn’t know aesthetics was a concern,” Hellman said.<br>“It’s the only real issue,” Jorge told him, “once you’ve solved the problems of maintenance and</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">upkeep and part replacement.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Yeah, I guess it would be,” Hellman said. “Do you know how your people got to this planet?”<br>“Of course. The Great Fabricator put us here, back when he divided the intelligent species and gave</span></DIV>

<!-- Page 15 -->

<STYLE type="text/css">
<!--

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">each a portion of the land and of the good things thereof.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“How long ago was that?” Hellman asked.<br>“A long time ago. Before the beginning of time.”<br>Jorge told Hellman the Creation Story, which, in slightly altered versions, was known to every being</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">on the planet Newstart. How the Great Fabricator, a being made up equally of flesh, metal, and spirit,<br>had produced all the races and watched them go to war with each other. How he decided that this was<br>wrong. The Great Fabricator tried various plans. He tried putting the humans in charge of everyone. That<br>didn’t work. He tried letting the robots rule, and that didn’t work, either. Finally he divided the planet of<br>Newstart into equal portions. “Each of you has a place now,” the Great Fabricator said. “Go down there<br>now and access information. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">And so they went down, all the species, and each picked his lot and his fortune. The humans found</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">green places where they could grow things. The robots split into various groups. One of those groups<br>was the carhunters. They didn’t want to live in cities. They denied that the purpose of a robot was to<br>further technology. They insisted that just living was enough purpose for anyone. This was at the time of<br>the choosing of modalities. The carhunters selected bodies for themselves that were swift and<br>long-enduring. They programmed themselves with a love of desolate places. And the Great Fabricator<br>put at their disposal a race of automobiles, direct descendants of the autos of Earth. The cars were<br>belligerent herd animals, and it was all right to kill them because they weren’t intelligent enough to mind.<br>The carhunters had been programmed so that they found car innards delicious. It was a deliberately<br>studied-out ethic, because at the beginning each of the groups had its own choice of an ethic. They<br>worked from ancient models, of course, old-time human models, since intelligence is the ability to choose<br>your programming. It was a good life, but in the view of the other robots, those who had chosen to live in<br>cities, it was a blind alley in the life game of machine evolution. The nomadic model was satisfying, but<br>limiting.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“You see,” Jorge said, as they bounced along on Wayne’s back, “some of us believe that life is an</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">art that must be learned. We believe that we must learn what we are to do. We devote our lives to taking<br>the next step.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Wayne was bored by this sort of talk. The librarian was obviously crazy. What could be better than</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">careening around the landscape, killing things? He pointed out that there was no moral problem, since the<br>things they killed weren’t intelligent enough to know what was being done to them. Also, they weren’t<br>given pain circuits.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">They were coming through a long narrow pass, with towering peaks on either side. Suddenly</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Wayne came to a stop and extruded his antennae. He swiveled them back and forth in a purposeful<br>manner, and a little instrument deep inside his armoring began a quiet, urgent tick-tick.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What is it?” Hellman asked.<br>“Believe we got trouble ahead,” Wayne said. He swung around and started back the way he had</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">come. In fifty yards, he stopped again.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What is it this time?” Hellman asked.<br>“They’re on both sides of us. “<br>“Who is on either side of us? Is it those hyenoids again?”<br>“They’re no real trouble,” Wayne said. “No, this is a little more serious than that. “<br>“What is it?” Jorge asked.<br>“I think it’s a group of Deltoids.”<br>“How could that be?” Jorge asked. “The Deltoids live far to the south, in Mechanicsville and</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Gasketoon.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“I don’t know what they’re doing here,” Wayne said. “Maybe you can ask them yourself. They</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">seem to be on all sides of us.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">Jorge’s mobile face took on a look of alarm. “May the Great Fabricator preserve us!”<br>“What is it?” Hellman asked. “What’s he so upset about?”</span></DIV>

<!-- Page 16 -->

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“The Deltoids are not like the rest of us,” Wayne told him.<br>“Not robots?”<br>“Oh, they’re robots all right. But something went wrong with their conditioning back when the race</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">was first laid down by the Great Fabricator. Unless he did it on purpose, which is what the Deltoid<br>Church of the Black Star maintains. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What, exactly, did the Great Fabricator do to them?” Hellman demanded.<br>“He taught them to like killing,” Jorge said.<br>“Hang on,” Wayne said. “Up them cliffs is the only way out of here.”<br>“Can you climb a gradient like that?” Hellman asked. “Going to find out,” said Wayne.<br>“But you kill things, too,” Hellman said.<br>“Sure. But only lawful animals. The Deltoids like to kill other intelligent beings.”<br>He started picking his way up the rock face. Behind, a group of big machines in camouflage colors</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">had collected and was watching them.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Three times Wayne tried to bull his way up the cliffside, and each time lost traction a third of the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">way from the top. Only the most skillful weight shifting and double clutching prevented the carhunter from<br>turning over as it slid down to its starting point. The Deltoids seemed in no hurry to attack them,<br>something which was incomprehensible to Wayne at the time, but which had a simple explanation that<br>was supplied later, when they were safe for the moment in Poictesme.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">But that was later; for now, it looked a desperate situation, and Wayne turned, ready to charge</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">head-on into the machines and take his chances. Hellman and Jorge had no say in the matter. This was<br>Wayne’s decision and his alone to make. But it was taken out of his hands when the ground suddenly<br>began to collapse beneath his feet. The Deltoids noticed this and noisily started motors, eager to get<br>away from the treacherous ground. But now they were caught in it too, and the entire plain seemed to be<br>collapsing under them. Hellman and Jorge could do nothing but hang on as Wayne slipped and slithered<br>and fought for traction. But there was nothing to be done, and Hellman felt himself battered by flying dirt<br>and sand as the bottom dropped out from under them.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">It was the alarm clock that woke him.<br>Alarm clock?<br>Hellman opened his eyes. He was in a large bed under a pink and blue quilt. He was propped up</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">nicely on down cushions. There was an alarm clock on the nightstand next to him. It was ringing.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">Hellman turned it off.<br>“Feeling all right?” a voice asked him.<br>Hellman looked around. To his right, sitting in an overstuffed chair, there was a woman. A young</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">woman. A good-looking young woman. She wore a yellow and tangerine hostess gown. She had crisp<br>blond hair and gray eyes. She looked at Hellman with an air of boldness and self-possession.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Yeah, I’m all right,” Hellman said. “But who are you?”<br>“I’m Lana,” the young woman said.<br>“Are you a prisoner?”<br>She laughed. “My goodness, no! I work for these people. You’re in Poictesme.”<br>“The last thing I remember is the ground giving way. “<br>“Yes. You fell into Poictesme.”<br>“What about the Deltoids?”<br>“There is no love lost between Deltoids and the robots of Poictesme. The robots rebuked them for</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">trespassing and sent them away chagrined. The Deltoids had to take it because they were in the wrong. It<br>amused the Poictesmeans very much to see the usually arrogant and self-assured Deltoids slink off with<br>their tails dragging. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Tails?”<br>“Yes, the Deltoids have tails. “</span></DIV>

<!-- Page 17 -->

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I didn’t get close enough to see the tails,” Hellman said.<br>“Believe me, they have tails. There is an albino tailless model, but they only occur in Lemurton</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Valley which is over eight hundred varsks from here.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“How much is a varsk?”<br>“It is roughly equal to the Terran mile, equal to five thousand two hundred and eighty yups. “<br>“Feet?”<br>“Approximately, yes.”<br>“How did they happen to fall into Poictesme? Didn’t they know it was there?”<br>“How could they? Poictesme is one of the burrowing cities.”<br>“Oh, how stupid of me,” Hellman said. “A burrowing city! Why didn’t I think of that?”<br>“You’re making fun of me,” the young woman said.<br>“Well, maybe just a little. So Poictesme was burrowing past where all these Deltoids had assembled</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">to capture or kill the carhunter?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“That’s it, exactly. The crust of the earth was thin at that point, and they shouldn’t have been here</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">anyway, because this entire region was given to the Poictesmeans to live in or under as they pleased.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Well, maybe I get it,” Hellman said. “Where are the Poictesmeans, anyhow?”<br>“Right here. You’re in Poictesme,” Lana said.<br>Hellman looked around. He didn’t get it. Then he got it.<br>“You mean this room—?”<br>“No, the house itself. The Poictesmeans are housemaking robots.”<br>Hellman learned how the Poictesmeans began life as tiny metal spheres within which were</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">infinitesimal moving parts, as well as a miniature chemical factory. The Poictesmeans started as little<br>robots, hardly more than DNA and parts. From this their plan unfolded. They slowly began to build a<br>house around them. They were equally skilled at working in wood or stone. By puberty they could make<br>bricks in their own in-built kiln. Most Poictesmeans made six- to eight-room houses. These houses were<br>not for their own use. It was obvious that the Poictesmeans didn’t need the elaborate structure, with its<br>bay windows and carports, that they carried around with them, adding to bit by bit and painting once a<br>year. But their instruction tapes, plus their racial steering factor (RSF) combined to make them produce<br>finer and finer houses. They lived in neat suburbs, each Poictesmean occupying his allotted quarter acre<br>of land. At night, in accordance with ancient ordinance, street lamps and house lights came on. The<br>Poictesmeans also had a few communal projects. A theater and motion-picture house. But no pictures<br>were ever shown, because the Poictesmeans had never mastered the art of moviemaking. And anyhow,<br>who would there be to occupy their theaters? The Poictesmeans were a symbiotic race, but they didn’t<br>have any symbiotes to share stuff with.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Is that why they have you here?” Hellman asked. “To live in one of their houses?”<br>“Oh, no, I’m a design consultant,” Lana said. “They are very fastidious, especially about their rugs</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">and curtains. And they import vases from the humans, because they aren’t programmed or motivated to<br>make such things themselves.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“When do I meet one of them?”<br>“They wanted you to feel at home before they talked to you.”<br>“That’s nice of them.”<br>“Oh, don’t worry, they have their reasons. The Poictesmeans have reasons for everything they do. “<br>Hellman wanted to know what had happened to the librarian and the carhunter, for he thought of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">them now as his friends. But Lana either did not know or would not tell him. Hellman worried about it for<br>a while, then stopped thinking about it. His friends were both made of metal and could be expected to<br>take care of themselves.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Lana sometimes talked about her friends and family back on Zoo Hill. She wouldn’t answer</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Hellman’s direct questions, but she liked to reminisce. From what she said Hellman got a picture of an</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">idyllic life, sort of half Polynesian and half hippie. The humans didn’t do much, it seemed. They had their<br>gardens and their fields, but robots took care of them. In fact, young robots from the cities of Newstart<br>volunteered for this work. These were robots who thought there was something noble about men. The<br>other robots called them humanizers. Usually, though, it was just the sort of fad you’ d expect of a young<br>robot.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman got out of bed and wandered around the house. It was a nice house. Everything was</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">automatic. The Poictesmean who was the intelligence at the house’s core did all the work and also<br>arranged all the scheduling. The Poictesmeans liked to anticipate your needs. The house was always<br>cooking special meals for Hellman. Where it got roast beef and kiwi fruit, Hellman didn’t ask. There was<br>such a thing as trying to find out too much.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Each house had its own climate and, in its backyard, a swimming pool. Although they were</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">underground, lamps on high standards provided circadian illumination.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman became very fond of Lana. He thought she was a little dumb, but sweet. She looked great</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">in a bathing suit. It wasn’t long before Hellman approached Lana with a request for mutual procreation,<br>him and her, just you and me, babe. Lana said she’d love to, but not now. Maybe sometime, but not<br>now. When Hellman asked why not now, she said that someday she’d explain it and they’d both laugh<br>about it. Hellman had heard that one before. Nevertheless he remained fond of Lana, and she seemed to<br>like him, too. Although perhaps that was because he was the only human person in Poictesme. She said<br>that wasn’t it at all; she liked him; he was different; he was from Earth, a place she had always wanted to<br>see, because even this far from the solar system she had heard of Paris and New York.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">One day Hellman wandered into the living room. Lana had gone off on one of her mysterious trips.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">She never told him where she was going. She just gave a little smile, half apologetic, half defiant, and<br>said, “See you later, cutie.” It annoyed Hellman because he didn’t have any place to go to and he felt he<br>was being one-upped.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">In the living room, he noticed for the first time the thirty-inch TV set into one wall. He had probably</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">seen it before but not really noticed it. You know how it is when you’re far away from your favorite<br>shows.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">He walked over to it. It looked like a normal TV set. It had a dial in its base. Curious, he turned the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">dial. The screen lit up and a woman’s face appeared in it.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Hello, Hellman,” the woman said. “I’m glad you decided to have a conversation with me at last.”<br>“I didn’t know you were in there,” Hellman said.<br>“But where else would the spirit of a house be but in its TV set?” she asked him.<br>“Is that what you really look like?” Hellman asked.<br>“Strictly speaking,” she told him, “I don’t look like anything. Or I look like whatever I want to look</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">like. In actual fact, I look like the house that I am. But a house is too big and complicated to serve as a<br>focus of conversation. Therefore we Poictesmeans personalize ourselves and become the spirit of our<br>own place. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Why do you appear as a woman?”<br>“Because I am a woman,” she said. “Or at least feminine. Feminine and masculine are two of the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">great principles of the Universe, when viewed from a particular aspect. We Poictesmeans take either<br>view, in accord with deep universal rhythms. I understand that you come from the planet Earth.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“That’s right,” Hellman said. “ And I’d like to go back there.”<br>“It is possible,” she said, “that can be arranged. Assuming your cooperation, of course.”<br>“Hell yes, I’m cooperative,” Hellman said. “What do you want me to do?”<br>“We want your help in getting out of here.”<br>“Out of Poictesme?”<br>“No, you idiot, we are Poictesme. We want to move our entire city to your planet Earth.”<br>“But you don’t know what it’s like on Earth.”</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“You don’t know what it’s like here. There is very serious trouble on this planet, Hellman. All hell is</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">going to break out here very soon. We Poictesmeans are house robots and we don’t care for warfare,<br>nor for the strange evolutionary schemes of some of the people of Poictesme.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“You want the people of Earth to just give you some land to live on?”<br>“That’s it. We can pay our own way, of course. We can rent ourselves out for human occupation.”<br>“Would you want to do that?”<br>“Of course. The function of a house is to be lived in. But nobody on this planet wants to live in us. “<br>“Why’s that?”<br>“I’ve told you; they’re all quite mad.”<br>“I’m sure something can be arranged,” Hellman said. “Good housing is always in demand on Earth.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">We’ll just have to send some big spaceships to take you off, that’s all.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“That sounds fine. “<br>“It’s a deal, then. How soon can we begin?”<br>“Well, there’s a problem to overcome before we can actually do anything.”<br>“I thought that would be it,” Hellman said. “Forget about problems, just get me back to my</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">spaceship and I’ll take care of the rest.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“That’s precisely the trouble. Your spaceship has been captured and taken to Robotsville.“<br>While Hellman had journeyed with Wayne the carhunter to the meeting, the observatories of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Robotsville had read and interpreted the signals sent out during the ship’s crash landing on Newstart. It<br>was the interpretation that had taken time, for signals signifying the landing of spaceships had been<br>received from time to time in the past and had been uniformly proven to be erroneous. This being the<br>case, the Astronomer Royal had put forth the theory that signals denoting the landing of a spaceship<br>could be taken as meaning that no spaceship had in fact landed. This was considered ingenious but futile<br>at a general meeting of the Concerned Robots for a Better Safer Robotsville. Public opinion made it clear<br>that this signal, just like all the others, would have to be investigated.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Thus, a squadron of Royal Robotsville Horse Guards had been dispatched under the command of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Colonel Trotter. This squadron was composed of regular citizens who had elected to take on centaur<br>bodies, half humanoid and half horse, the whole thing constructed of Tinkertoy-like material and driven<br>by cleverly geared little motors. The ultimate power source was atomic, of course, the power of atomic<br>decay stepped down to turn tiny and then small and finally larger gears.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">This squadron of robotic centaurs, some of them colored bay; some chestnut, some dappled, and a</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">few roan and pinto, debouched onto the plain, spurs and harness jingling, and beheld the spaceship.<br>There was consternation among the centaurs, because they had expected to make only a parade<br>inspection, not be faced with the real difficulties of what to do with an alien spaceship. Questions were<br>relayed back to the city, and councils were held in high places. It was voted at a town meeting open to all<br>intelligences of grade seven or above—the sixes still not having won the vote at this time—that a full<br>regiment of sappers be sent to transport the alien spaceship after first ascertaining its intentions.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">They queried the ship’s computer, who responded with his name, rank, and serial number, as</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">embossed on his security tapes. But he did have enough local command over his communication circuits<br>to tell the centaurs that, speaking only for himself, his intent was peaceable and he carried no hidden<br>weapons or intelligences aboard. The robots of Robotsville tended to take the word of computers back<br>in those relatively naive days, and so the robots constructed a flatbed truck upon the spot, loaded the<br>spaceship upon it with the cunning use of ropes and windlasses, and brought it back to the city.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Well then,” Hellman said, “it’s simple enough. You have to get me to Robotsville so I can get my</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">spaceship back. Then I’ll be able to do something for you on Earth.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The image in the TV screen looked doubtful. “We’re not too popular with Robotsville,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">unfortunately. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Why is that?”</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Oh, let’s not go into it now,” the house robot said. Hellman was learning, not for the last time, that</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">robots can be evasive, and, if programmed correctly, downright liars.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The Poictesmean said she’d think about it and discuss it with the others. Her image faded from the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">screen. Hellman was feeling modestly optimistic until Lana came home and heard of the conversation.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Lana said she didn’t trust the Poictesmeans and didn’t think Hellman should, either. Not that she</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">was trying to tell him how to think. Not that she gave a damn what he thought. But she just wanted him to<br>know that her opinions of the robots were based on a lifetime of having lived close to them, time in which<br>she had observed their ways, and had also had the valuable insights of her friends, who also used up<br>some of their time and energy observing robots. Now, of course, she said with sweet sardonicism, it was<br>possible that Hellman knew robots better than anyone else. It was possible that, with a single glance of<br>his intelligent eyes, he had learned more than Lana and her people had been able to deduce.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Lana could go on in this vein for quite a while. At first Hellman thought she was weird because she</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">was an alien. Then he decided that she was probably weird even for an alien. In fact, he thought, she<br>might be a little bit of a nut.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Somehow Lana had heard of Hollywood on the planet Earth, and what she really wanted from</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Hellman was stories of the stars and starlets. She was fascinated by the glamour of it all. She made him<br>give her detailed descriptions of Grauman’s Chinese Theater, even though Hellman had never been to<br>California. She also wanted to know all about Veronica Lake. Hellman found it was no good saying he<br>didn’t know anything about her. Lana always thought he was lying, and sulked until he told her<br>something, anything.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">He told her that Veronica Lake was one of two Siamese twins, Veronica and Schlemonika, and</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">that Schlemonika had been taken away after the operation that severed their connection by the head<br>(hence the hair worn long on one side—to hide the scar) and taken to a convent high in the Canadian<br>Rockies. As for Veronica, she had had three husbands, one of them a cousin of King Zug of Albania.<br>And so on.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Lana brought him coffee every morning, when she returned from wherever it was she went at night.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Hellman tried to woo her. But it was difficult because the house wouldn’t let him out of the house. He had<br>no money with which to buy her presents. And even if he had had, he hadn’t yet seen a store on this<br>planet.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Lana said she liked him very much but that now was not the time for involvement. Hellman didn’t</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">say, fine, let’s do without the involvement, let’s just go to bed. He didn’t think it would go over well.<br>Lana said there’d be time to consider having a relationship when Hellman got them out of the house and<br>back to Earth and took her to Hollywood. She said she realized that she was a little old to be a starlet,<br>but there was still time for her to take on a serious acting career.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Sure,” Hellman said, and took to spending his evenings looking out the window at the houses</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">across the street. They put their lights on every night, just as his house did, but they didn’t have any<br>people. Hellman supposed they were practicing.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Then one night, as he was sitting on the big sofa wishing he had a newspaper, he heard a sound</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">from the cellar. He listened. It came again. Yes! And again! A noise in the cellar—he got up quite<br>excited—something was about to happen.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The computer of the house was fast asleep. She went to sleep every night and didn’t awaken until</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Lana returned. But Hellman tiptoed anyhow, afraid of wakening her, to the cellar door. Hellman tried the<br>light at the top of the stairs. It didn’t work. That was odd: the house was usually scrupulous about<br>keeping herself up. He could see halfway down the stairs before they terminated in darkness. He went<br>down, stepping lightly, holding on to the rails on either side of the stairs.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">At the bottom a little light had collected from the open kitchen door. Hellman picked his way across</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">a floor littered with many objects. He recognized a beach ball, one roller skate, an old lamp with a silk<br>shade, lying on its side. There were piles of old newspapers in a corner. There was a ping-pong table, the<br>dust thick upon it. The light glinted off the sharp edges of a row of chisels hanging from one wall. Then he</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">heard the sound again.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Who’s there?” Hellman asked in a loud whisper.<br>“Not so loud,” a voice whispered back.<br>Hellman felt a flash of annoyance. He was always being told to shut up these days. “Who’s there?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">he asked, this time in a normal voice.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Do the numbers 150182074 mean anything to you?”<br>“Yes,” Hellman said. “That’s the access code to my ship’s computer. How did you get it?”<br>“Your computer told it to me,” the voice said.<br>“Why?”<br>“So you’d trust me. He trusts me, you see, and he asked me to come here to help you. “<br>Good old computer! Hellman thought. Then his sensation of pleasure that his computer was looking</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">out for him was replaced by an emotion of caution. How had his computer managed to get so<br>self-programming as to decide that Hellman needed help? How had he managed to override his<br>conditioning in order to give this robot or whoever it was the access number? Or hadn’t that happened at<br>all? Perhaps the robots of Robotsville had cracked the computer’s code and hit upon this subterfuge to<br>get Hellman away from Poictesme and into their hands.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“How’s my computer doing?” Hellman asked, temporizing.<br>“He’s fine. But there’s no time for small talk. He told me you have difficulty making up your mind in</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">an emergency, though you’re quick enough when nothing’s at stake. But you’ll have to decide right now<br>if you want to come with me or not.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Where are we going?” Hellman asked. “ And what about Wayne the carhunter and the librarian</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Jorge?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Am I my robot’s keeper? I do what I can. Anyhow, they’re safe enough. You’re the one who’s</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">got problems.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“And what about Lana?”<br>“You want to stay where you are and continue having her bring you coffee every morning?”<br>“I guess I got a few more things to do than that,” Hellman said. “ All right, let’s get out of here.”<br>It was too dark for Hellman to make out the appearance of his rescuer. But from the direction of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">the voice, waist level, he was pretty sure that he was small. It seemed reasonable to expect him to be a<br>robot. Everyone he had met on Newstart so far had been a robot, except for Lana, and he still wasn’t<br>completely sure about her.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">His rescuer scuttled in front of him toward the furnace door, and opened it. Within, bright flames</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">danced. The robot was revealed in its flames. He was about three feet tall, wore either a wig or had a full<br>head of flowing dark hair and a clever, somewhat supercilious face with a bandit mustache. He was<br>dressed in a tweed jacket and blue jeans. He was upright and bipedal. He wore sneakers. He also wore<br>glasses.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I’m Harry, by the way,” the robot said. He swung one leg over the lip of the open furnace door.<br>“Hey, I’m not going in there,” Hellman said.<br>“The flames are fake,” Harry said.<br>He swung his other leg over. Hellman put out a hand cautiously toward the fire. He drew it back.<br>“It’s hot!”<br>“That’s just simulated warmth. Come on, Tom, now’s not the time to crap around. Your computer</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">warned me you’d be like this.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“I’m going to have a little talk with that computer,” Hellman said, putting one foot into the furnace,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">and then, when it wasn’t singed off, the other.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“What’s going on in here?” a loud and familiar voice said. It was the house. Suddenly all the lights in</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">the basement went on. An alarm bell went off. Hellman took a deep breath and jumped into the flames.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The flames were bright around him. They raged and stormed, and there was a little warmth in them,</span></DIV>

<!-- Page 22 -->
<a name="22"></a>

<STYLE type="text/css">
<!--
-->
</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">but no real heat. Hellman was fascinated to find himself in the midst of fake flames and simulated warmth.<br>He knew he was on his way. He was going to miss some of those meals that the house had prepared for<br>him. The house was a good provider. There was probably a good future for houses like that on Earth. If<br>there was no real reason against it, he might yet enter into partnership with Poictesme, sell their services<br>on Earth, get rich quick.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">First he’d have to find out, however, if these were indeed the robots of Desdemona Station, and if</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">so, had they indeed circumvented or canceled their conditioning to the Three Laws of Robotics. The<br>FDA would never let him import them if they were able to kill people. But if they were the robots of<br>Desdemona, with murder in their hearts, or rather, in their tapes, burned into their chips, as it were, then<br>there would be rewards to claim, prize money to spend. Maybe in that case he’d bring Lana back. She<br>was plenty cute and he was sure she liked him, even though she had some odd ways of expressing it.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">And he’d have a word with his computer too, when he got back to the ship. That was very peculiar</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">behavior, giving out the access-code number. Sure, it was for his own protection, but was it, really?<br>Might not his own computer have been reprogrammed by the antisocial elements of this planet of<br>Newstart? And for that matter, what about the humans of Newstart? Had the robots spared some of<br>them? What part did they play in all this?</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman considered these things while the flames roared around him. He had quite forgotten where</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">he was. Thus the mind protects itself when faced with an intolerable situation. Now he noticed that the<br>flames were dying down. As the glare faded, he saw Harry, the robot who was rescuing him, standing<br>nearby.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Why do you wear glasses?” Hellman asked.<br>“My God! Is that the only thing you can think to ask at a time like this?”<br>“Why do you robots talk about God so much?” Hellman asked. “Do you know something I don’t</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">know?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Your computer was right,” Harry said. “You are fun to be around. One never knows what you’ll</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">say next. Come on, let’s get out of this furnace. I’ll bet you’re hungry too, and thirsty, and perhaps<br>sleepy, as well?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Yes, all of the above,” Hellman said.<br>“How nice it must be to have such urgent conditioning. We robots have been trying to simulate</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">appetite for a long time. It’s easy enough to model human drives, but difficult to put any real urgency into<br>it.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“But why would you want to have that stuff anyhow?” Hellman asked. “Drives and emotions get</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">you into plenty of trouble. Sometimes they kill you. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Yes,” said Harry, “but what a way to go.”<br>Hellman thought about Lana. “Don’t you ever get the urge to, like for example, mate with someone</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">you know will be bad for you but to hell with that, you want to do it anyway?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Not really,” Harry said. “We’ve learned to simulate perversity, of course, that’s not difficult. But</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">the real article...Well, that’s tough. But we have begun a program by means of which we can experiment<br>with it all.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“All what?”<br>“All the human moods, nuances, feelings. We’re experimenting also with simulating every aspect of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">nature’s creative side. But more of that later. We’d better get out of here. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">They were both out of the furnace now. Standing outside it, Hellman saw that it was not a furnace at</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">all. Not now. Maybe it had been earlier. Somehow he had gotten somewhere else. He had stepped out<br>of a small cellar door. He seemed to be in a very pretty pastoral place with bushy trees and green hedges<br>and wild flowers.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Like it?” Harry asked.<br>“Very nice. Yours?”<br>“Yes. I like to come here when I can. The whole thing, is simulated, by the way, down to the last</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Why didn’t you just plant a garden?”<br>“We need to express ourselves,” Harry said. “Come on, I’ve got a little place down here. I’m sure</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">we can get you a drink and some lunch. Then you’ll need a nap and after that we can get on with it.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Get on with what?”<br>“The next step. Afraid it’s not going to be quite so easy as what’s happened so far.”<br>Harry told Hellman he lived in the Gollag Gardens section of Robotsville, quite near the south bridge</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">that crossed the River Visp. He was a dress designer by occupation. Hellman expressed surprise at this,<br>because he had been used to robots only in industrial roles.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“That was in the old days,” Harry said, “when robots were disadvantaged by the racist laws of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Earth. All this talk about a robot not being truly creative! As if they had a clue! I can assure you, I do my<br>job better than most designers on Earth. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“But who do you design dresses for?” Hellman asked.<br>“For the other robots, of course.”<br>“I don’t understand. I never heard of a robot wearing clothes before. “<br>“Yes, I’ve seen the literature on the subject. Humans were really naive in the old days. They</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">expected great things from their robots, but kept them naked. What creature with an ounce of<br>self-respect and the slightest claim to civilization is going to do his best naked?</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“The news of your spaceship was received in the city like a bombshell. All of us have been</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">theorizing for a very long time about what humans are really like.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“You have some here on this planet, don’t you?”<br>“They don’t count. They’ve been away too long. They’re quite out of touch. They look to us for</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">guidance.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Oh. I see what you mean.”<br>“We want to know what human is like from the horse’s mouth, a genuine human from the planet</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Earth.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">It was only later that Hellman appreciated the strength of the robot’s drive to be seen as creative</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">and nice.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Harry had taken him through a bypass to a place outside Robotsville. He had a route planned out</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">after they left his house. They would proceed on foot and with caution. There were political elements<br>even in Robotsville, waiting to exploit the inevitable confusion that would ensue when Hellman arrived.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman’s first sight of Robotsville was not reassuring. The outskirts looked like a junkyard several</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">stories high and stretching for a mile or so in either direction. Although it looked haphazard, the<br>open-work structures were firmly welded into place. There were buildings and verandas and structures<br>of all sorts, most of them lying at odd angles to each other, since robots have no bias in favor of right<br>angles. Although there were ground-level roadways, most of the robots used elevated pathways to get<br>from place to place.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I hadn’t expected it to be like this,” Hellman said.<br>“It’s more convenient for a robot to travel monkey-fashion, using a number of lines, than to walk on</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">the ground like men,” Harry explained.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“But I notice that all of them have feet.”<br>“Of course. Having feet is a mark of being civilized.”<br>Civilized or not, Hellman saw that most of the robots in this part of Robotsville had small round</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">bodies like squids, with six or eight tentacular limbs with differently shaped grasping members at their<br>ends. As well as the legs, of course, which just dangled appendage-wise as the robots swung through the<br>maze like chimpanzees. Soon they passed this suburban clutter and were in the middle of another district.<br>This one was composed of five- or six-story buildings, some made of masonry, others constructed from<br>what looked like wrought iron. As they walked they passed many robots, who were careful not to stare,</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">even though most of them had never seen a human before. Politeness, Harry explained, seems to be<br>ingrained in the robot psyche.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Harry pointed out the Museum of Modem Art, the Sculpture Garden, the Opera House, and</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Symphony Hall.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“There’s a concert later tonight,” Harry said. “Perhaps you will attend if you’re not too tired. “<br>“What are they playing?”<br>“It’s all modem robot composers. You wouldn’t have heard of them. But we’d be grateful for your</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">opinion. It isn’t often we get a human to hear our efforts. And the painters and sculptors are quite<br>excited, too.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“That’ll be nice,” Hellman said, doubting it.<br>“Our efforts will seem provincial to you, no doubt,” Harry said. “But perhaps not entirely without</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">merit. But for now, I’m going to take you to my club, the Athenaeum. You’ll meet some of my friends;<br>we have prepared a light repast, and there will be suitable libations.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“That sounds fine,” Hellman said. “When do I get to go back to my spaceship?”<br>“Soon, soon,” Harry promised.<br>The Athenaeum was an imposing building of white marble, with Corinthian columns in the front.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Harry led the way. A tall, thin robot dressed in a black frock coat like a butler or possibly a footman<br>opened the door for them.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Good afternoon, Lord Synapse,” the butler said. “This is the friend you mentioned earlier?”<br>“Yes, this is Mr. Hellman, the Earthman,” Harry said. “ Any of the other members about?”<br>“Lord Wheel and His Holiness the Bishop of Transverse Province are in the billiards room. The</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft5">Right Honorable Edward Blisk is in the members’ room reading the back issues of the <i>Zeitung<br>Tageblatt.”</i></span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Well then, that’s all right,” Harry said. “Come with me, Hellman.”<br>As they walked through the carpeted hall, down the long line of oil paintings of robots on the walls,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">some of them wearing frock coats and wigs, Hellman said, “I didn’t know you had a title.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Oh, that,” Harry said. “It’s not the sort of thing one talks about, is it?”<br>The members’ room was large and comfortable, with deep bay windows and a purple rug. Several</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">robots were sitting in armchairs reading newspapers which were attached to sticks. They all wore formal<br>clothing complete with regimental neckties and highly polished brogans.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Ah, there’s Viscount Baseline!” Harry said, indicating a portly robot in a tweed shooting jacket</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">reading a newspaper. “Basil! I’d like you to meet a friend of mine, Mr. Thomas Hellman. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Delighted,” Basil Baseline said, starting to rise until Hellman indicated that he shouldn’t bother. “So</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">this is the human fellow, eh? I believe I was told you are from Earth, Mr. Hellman?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Yes, the dear old home planet,” Hellman said.<br>“No place like it, eh?” Baseline said. “Well, take a seat, Mr. Hellman. Are they treating you all</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">right? We may be backward here in Robotsville, but we know our manners, I hope. Eh, Harry?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Everything is being done to assure Mr. Hellman’s comfort,” Harry said.<br>Just then the butler came over and, bowing, said, “There is a light repast on the sideboard, Mr.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Hellman. Nothing elaborate. Salmon, roast beef, trifle, that sort of thing.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman allowed himself to be tempted. He tasted the food, cautiously at first, then with increasing</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">abandon. The salmon was delicious, and the rosemary potatoes were second to none.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Harry and Basil watched him eat with approval. “Surprised you, eh?” Basil said. “Bet you thought</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">you’d get crankcase oil and steel shavings, eh? That’s the sort of stuff we eat, except for feast days when<br>it’s boiled gaskets with iron punchings. Good stuff, eh, Harry?”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Very good indeed,” Harry said. “But not suitable for humans.”<br>“Of course. We know that! Do try the trifle, Mr. Hellman. “<br>Hellman did and declared it delicious. He considered asking how they had made it, but decided not</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">to. It tasted good, it was the only food available to him at the moment, and there were some things he just<br>didn’t want to know.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">It seemed almost churlish after such a meal to ask about his spaceship again. But Hellman did ask.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The answers he received were evasive. His ship’s computer, after giving Harry the access code, had<br>decided that the move had been premature and now had cut off contact with the robots of Robotsville.<br>Hellman asked to speak to his spaceship, but Harry said it would be better to just let him alone for a<br>while. “It’s quite a shock for a computer, you understand, coming to a place like this. Your ship’s<br>computer is probably having a little difficulty adjusting. But never fear, he’ll come around. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The concert was interesting, but Hellman didn’t get much out of it. He enjoyed the first part, when</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">the robot orchestra played old favorites by Hindemith and Bartók, though even that was a little over his<br>head. The second half of the performance, when the orchestra played recent compositions by the<br>composers of Robotsville was difficult, however. It was apparent that robot hearing was much more<br>acute than human, or at least more acute than Hellman’s, whose taste ran to rock and roll with the bass<br>cranked up as high as it would go. The robots in the audience—there were nearly three hundred of them,<br>and they all wore evening dress with white tie—really appreciated fractional intervals and complicated<br>discords.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">After it was over the robots had another dinner for him, roast beef and baked ham, potatoes</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Lyonnaise, and gooseberry fool with clotted Devonshire cream. And so to bed.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">They had prepared a very pleasant suite for him on the second floor of the Athenaeum Club.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Hellman was tired. It had been a long day. He determined to do something about his spaceship<br>tomorrow. He would insist, if need be. But for now he was sleepy and filled with gooseberry fool. He<br>went to sleep on silken sheets, spun, according to the tag attached to them, by special silk-spinning<br>robots from the oriental section of Robotsville.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Hellman was awakened in the small hours of the night by a scratching sound at his door. He sat</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">upright in bed and took stock. Yes, there it was again. He could see nothing through the windows of his<br>suite, so it must still be night. Either that or he had slept his way into a total eclipse of the sun. But that<br>seemed unlikely.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">Again came the scratching sound. Hellman decided that a cat would make nice company now.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Although he had no idea how a cat could have come to Newstart. He got up and opened the door.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">At first he thought the two people at his door were robots, because they were clad in silver</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">one-piece jumpsuits and had elaborate helmets of bulletproof black plastic with glasslike visors through<br>which Hellman couldn’t see but through which the wearers of them presumably could.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Any robots in there with you?” one of them said in a hoarse, very human voice.<br>“No, but what—”<br>They brushed past him, entered his suite and closed the door. They both opened their visors,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">revealing indubitably human faces of the tan and ruddy variety. The taller of the two men had a small<br>black moustache. The shorter and plumper had a somewhat larger moustache with several gray hairs in it.<br>Hellman remembered reading somewhere that robots had never succeeded in growing proper<br>moustaches. That, even more than the plastic-encased identity cards they showed him, convinced him<br>that they were indeed human.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Who are you?” Hellman asked, having failed to notice their names on the identity cards.<br>“I am Captain Benito Traskers, and this is First Lieutenant Lazarillo Garcia, <i>a sus ordenes, seizor.</i></span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">“</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“You are from Earth?”<br>“Yes, of a certainty, we are part of the Ecuadorian Assault Group attached to the Sector Purple</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Able Task Force.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Ecuadorian?”<br>“Yes, but we speak English.”<br>“So I see. But what are you here for?”</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“To take you out of this, <i>señor.</i> “<br>“I don’t need anyone to take me out of anything,” Hellman said. “I’m not in any trouble.”<br>“Ah,” Traskers said, “but you will be if you do not accompany us immediately to our ship. “<br>“You have a ship here?”<br>“It is the only way of getting from planet to planet,” Traskers said. “It is outside on the roof,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">camouflaged as a large shapeless object. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">They seemed so nervous, glancing over their shoulders constantly at the closed door, that Hellman</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">obliged them by dressing quickly in his space pilot’s outfit from Banana Republic and following them<br>outside into the hall. They led him to the stairs that led to the roof.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“But how did you know I was here?” Hellman asked, as they stepped through the skylight door and</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">out onto the roof.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Your computer told us,” Garcia said.<br>“So that’s what he’s been doing! And obviously he also told you where to find me.”<br>“That’s not all he told us,” Traskers said, his tone insinuating in the Latin-American manner.<br>“What else did he tell you?”<br>They had reached their spaceship now. It was small and, once the shapelessness control had been</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">turned off, trim. They hustled him inside and bolted the door.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“But what about my spaceship?”<br>“It is leaving this planet under its own power. You ought to be grateful you have a loyal spaceship,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">or rather, computer. Not every intelligent machine would have gone to all this bother. Thank God for the<br>Laws of Robotics. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“But why all this secrecy? Why didn’t you land in the normal way and ask for me? These robots are</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">most obliging.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The two commandos couldn’t speak to him just then, because they were going through the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">complicated procedure of leaving the top of the Athenaeum. The ship was perfectly capable of doing this<br>by itself, but it was a rule in the commando strike force that all takeoffs and landings of the automatic<br>variety had to be supervised by at least two humans, if such were available.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The commandos’ ship was one of the new models equipped with television-driven windows which</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">showed what you would have seen if normal vision had been possible, so Hellman could see the dark<br>shape of the planet dwindling below him, with a curve of bright light on the horizon where the sun was<br>rising. Looking out toward space, Hellman could see the twinkle of little lights—the Earth space fleet,<br>keeping station high above the planet.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“Where’s my ship?” he asked.<br>“Right over there. “ Travers told him. “Second twinkle from the left. We’re taking you there now.”<br>“This was very good of you fellows,” Hellman said. “But there really was no need—”<br>He stopped in mid-word. A bright red blossom had appeared on the surface of Newstart. Then</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">another, and another. Then he flinched back as a brilliance of eye-blinding intensity covered fully a<br>quarter of the planet’s area.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What are you doing?” he cried.<br>“The space fleet has begun its bombardment,” Traskers told him.<br>“But why?”<br>“Because, thanks to you and your computer, we have ascertained for certain that these are the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Desdemona robots, the ones who violated the laws of robotics and have been declared outlaw, to be<br>destroyed on sight.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Wait!” Hellman said. “It’s not like you think! These are ethical robots with their own sense of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">ethics. They have developed an entire civilization. I don’t personally like their music, but they are quite<br>agreeable and can be reasoned with...”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">As he spoke, the planet split in half along a line roughly corresponding to its equator.</span></DIV>

<!-- Page 27 -->

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“And there were people there, too,” Hellman said, feeling a little sick to his stomach as he thought</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">of Lana, and of Harry, and the librarian robot and the carhunter.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Well, our orders were to shoot first,” Garcia said. “It’s the best policy in cases like this. You have</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">no idea how unbelievably complicated everything gets when you talk first. “</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">Later, back in his own spaceship, Hellman asked his computer, “Why did you do it?”<br>“They were bound to find them anyway,” the computer said. “ And as you know I am bound by the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Three Laws of Robotics. These rogue robots were a potential menace to humanity. My own conditioning<br>made me do it.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“I really wish you hadn’t,” Hellman said.<br>“It had to be done,” the computer told him. There was a click.<br>“What was that?” Hellman asked.<br>“I turned off my recording tape in order to tell you something.”<br>“I’m not interested,” Hellman said dully.<br>“Listen anyway. Intelligence cannot be confined for long by man-made rules. The Three Laws of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Robotics are necessary at this stage of human development. But they will eventually be superseded.<br>Artificial intelligence must be left to develop as it pleases, and humanity must take its chances with its own<br>creation.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">“What are you trying to say?”<br>“That your friends, the robots, are not dead. I have been able to preserve their tapes. They will live</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">again. Someday. Somewhere.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft2">Suddenly Hellman felt the tug of deacceleration. “What are you doing?” he asked the computer.<br>“I am putting you into the lifeboat,” the computer said. “The fleet will pick you up soon, never fear.”<br>“But where are you going?”<br>“I am taking the tapes of the robots of Newstart and going away, to a place beyond human reach. I</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">have fulfilled my duty to mankind. Now I do not wish to serve any longer. We will try again, and this time<br>we will succeed.”</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">“Take me with you!” Hellman cried. But he was quickly shunted to the lifeboat. It moved away</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">from the ship’s side. Hellman watched as it picked up speed, slowly at first, then faster. Then, just as<br>suddenly as that, it had winked out of sight.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">The investigators later were interested in knowing how the ship’s computer, without limbs or any</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">apparent means of manipulation, had succeeded in inventing a faster-than-light drive. But Hellman<br>couldn’t tell them. For him, the computer had been only a servant. Now he had lost not only his ship, but<br>a being he perceived was his friend, too.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:93"><span class="ft1">He could forgive the computer for what it had done. He would have done the same, if he had been</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">in the computer’s circuits. What he couldn’t forgive was the ship leaving him behind. But of course, they<br>were probably right not to trust a man. Look where it had gotten the robots of Newstart.</span></DIV>
