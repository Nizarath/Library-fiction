<b> <br> <br></b>1. Use of `Simple Premises' Termed Misleading <br>
 <br>Tom Mishkin was tooling along through the Lesser Magellanic Cloud at a low multiple <br>
of the speed of light, moving along smartly but not really pushing it. His ship, the <br><i>Intrepid III, </i>was loaded with frozen South African lobster tails, tennis shoes, air <br>
conditioners, malted milk makers, and other general stores, bound for the settlement on <br>Dora V. Mishkin was catnapping in a big command chair, lulled by the light patterns <br>
rippling across the control board and by the quiet snap and crackle of the circuit <br>breakers. He was thinking of a new apartment he planned to buy in the town of Perth <br>
Amboy-bas-mer, ten miles due east of Sandy Hook. You could get a little peace and quiet <br>in the suburbs, although the problem of commuting by submarine... <br>
One of the snaps turned into a clank. <br>Mishkin sat upright, his pilot's ear always attuned for the Malfunction That Could Not <br>
Happen but frequently did. <br>
Clank, clank, clank, crunch. <br>Yes. It had happened. <br>
Mishkin groaned--that special pilot's groan compounded of foreknowledge, fatalism, <br>
and heartburn. He could hear bad things happening deep in the guts of the ship. The <br>
Malfunction Telltale (supposedly for external impingement only) went violet, then red, <br>then purple, then black. The ship's computer awoke from its dogmatic slumber long <br>
enough to growl, `Malfunction, malfunction, malfunction.' <br>
`Thanks, I already got the idea,' Mishkin said. `Where is it and what is it?' <br>`Malfunction in Part L-1223A. Catalogue name: Port Side Crossover Lock Valve <br>
Assembly and Retainer Ring. Proximate cause of malfunction: 8 (eight) sheered bolts <br>plus spiral fracture in retainer ring housing. Intermediate cause: angular pressure on <br>
aforesaid parts resulted in molecular changes in metal composition of aforementioned <br>parts, resulting in the condition known as metal fatigue.' <br>
`Yeah. But why?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Conjecture as to primary cause: various bolts in said assembly torqued to <br>
unacceptable pressures, thus reducing the assembly's life to 84.3 hours rather than the <br>195.441 working years called for in the specifications.' <br>
`Very nice,' Mishkin said. `What's happening now?' <br>
`I have cut out the unit and shut down the main drive.' <br>`Up space creek without a paddle,' Mishkin commented. `Can I use the main drive at <br>
all, just long enough to get to the nearest Ship Service Centre?' <br>
`Negative. Use of aforementioned malfunctioned Part would cause immediate and <br>
cumulative distortions in other parts of Main Drive, resulting in total disablement, <br>implosion, and death, and a permanent black mark on your service record. You would <br>
also be billed for a new spaceship.' <br>
`Well, I certainly don't want any black marks on my record,' Mishkin said. `What should <br>
I do?' <br>
`Your only feasible option is to remove and replace the malfunctioned Part. Caches of <br>
spare parts have been established on various uninhabited planets to cover such a <br>
 <br>


<A name=2></a>necessity. The planet nearest to your present coordinates is Harmonia II, 68 hours from <br>here by secondary drive.' <br>
`That sounds simple enough,' Mishkin said. <br>`It is, theoretically.' <br>
`But practically?' <br>`There are always complications.' <br>
`Such as?' <br>`If we knew that,' the computer told him, `the complications wouldn't be very <br>
complicated, would they?' <br>
`I suppose not,' Mishkin said. `All right, cut a course and let's get going,' <br>`To hear is to obey,' the computer said. <br>
USE OF `MULTIPLE PREMISES' TERMED CONFUSING <br><i>In an exclusive press interview yesterday, Professor David Hume of Harvard declared </i><br>
<i>that sequence did not imply causality. When asked to amplify, he pointed out that <br>sequence is merely additive, not generative. </i><br>
<i>We asked Dr Emmanuel Kant for his opinion on this statement. Professor Kant, in his </i><br>
<i>Cal Tech study, looked badly shaken. `This,' he said, `has awakened me from my </i><br>
<i>dogmatic slumber.' <br></i><b> <br> <br></b>2. The Mad Synaesthesiast Strikes <br>
 <br>Mishkin leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes. That was bad: derangement of <br>
various sense ratios, ideas of reference, hot flashes. He opened his eyes. That was not so <br>
good either. He reached for the Turn-off Bottle. It had a label that read, IF THE TRIP <br>GOES BAD, DRINK THIS. He drank it, then noticed a label on the other side of the bottle <br>
that read, IF THE TRIP GOES BAD, DO <i>NOT </i>DRINK THIS. <br>
One of the radios was moaning softly to itself, `Oh, God, I'll be killed. I just know I'll <br>
be killed. Why did I ever go on this crazy trip? It wasn't good enough for me to just sit in <br>
the window at the Hallicrafters and dig the scene. No, I had to get active about it and <br>where in hell am I now?' <br>
Mishkin had no time for the radio. He had problems of his own. At least he assumed <br>
that they were his own. It was difficult to be sure. <br>
He found that he had only imagined opening his eyes. Therefore he opened his eyes. <br>
But had he really? He considered opening his eyes again, in case he had only imagined it <br>
again, but stopped himself, thus avoiding a really nasty form of infinite regression. <br>
The radio was babbling again: `God, I don't know where I'm going. But if I knew <br>
where I was going I wouldn't go there. But not knowing where I'm going, I don't know <br>
how not to go there because I don't know where I'm going. Damn it, this isn't the way <br>it's supposed to be. They told me it would be fun.' <br>
Mishkin quickly drank the contents of the Turn-off Bottle. It couldn't get much worse <br>
he decided, which showed how much he knew. <br>
Firmness seemed called for. Mishkin sat up straight in his chair. He said, `Now hear <br>
this. We will proceed to act on the premise that we all are what we seem to be at this <br>
moment and that we will remain this way indefinitely. That is an order. Is it understood?' <br>
The turntable said, `Everything's going to goddamn hell and he's giving orders, yet. <br>
What's with you, Jack, you think this is a goddamned <i>submarine </i>or something?' <br>
`We must all pull together,' Mishkin said, `else we shall all be pulled apart.' <br>`Platitudes, yet,' the armchair said. `We could all be killed and he's spouting <br>
platitudes.' <br>
Mishkin shuddered and drank the contents of the Turn-on Bottle, then put it down <br>
quickly before the bottle had a chance to drink him. Bottles had been known to do that; <br>you could never tell when it was role-reversal time. <br>
`Now I shall land this ship,' Mishkin said. <br>`It's a dreary premise,' the control board said. `But go ahead and play games if you <br>
want to.' <br>
`Shut up,' Mishkin said. `You're a control board.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=3></a>`What would you say if I told you that I am a middle-aged psychiatrist from New York <br>
City and that your act of labelling me a control board--by which you mean a <i>to-be-</i><br>
<i>controlled board -</i>or<i> bored - </i>shows where your head is at, powerstrugglewise?' <br>
Mishkin decided to drink the contents of the Turn-on Bottle. He was in enough trouble <br>
as it was. With an enormous effort he blew his nose. Lights flashed. <br>
A man in a blue uniform came through the baggage room and said, `All tickets, <br>
please.' Mishkin gave him his ticket, which the man punched. <br>
Mishkin punched a button, which took it like a man. There were groans and squeaks. <br>
Was he coming down? <br><b> <br> <br></b>3. New `Plausibility Generator' said to Cure Schizophrenia <br>
 <br>The cache on Harmonia was a large brightly lighted structure, all stainless steel and <br>
glass, looking irrevocably like a Miami Beach supermarket. Mishkin drove his spaceship <br>
in, turned off the engine, and put the key in his pocket. He walked down the gleaming <br>aisles past shelves loaded with trays of transistors, six-pacs of silicones, vapour recovery <br>
systems, chuck roasts, freezer-pacs of glycol brine, baby spectrometers, spark plugs, <br>coaxial loudspeakers, tuner modules, foil-sealed vitamin B6 capsules, and nearly <br>
everything else that the far-travelling tripper of inner/outer space might require. <br>
He came to the central communications panel. There he asked for Part L-1223A. <br>He waited. Minutes passed. <br>
`Hey!' Mishkin called out. `What happened? What's up?' <br>`Terribly sorry,' the control panel replied. `I'm afraid I was woolgathering. I've been <br>
having rather a trying time of it.' <br>
`What's been the matter?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`Difficulties, many difficulties,' the panel said. `Really, you can have no idea. My head <br>
is positively swimming. I speak figuratively, of course.' <br>
`You talk funny for a control panel,' Mishkin said, suspiciously. <br>
`These days control panels come equipped with personalities. It makes us seem less <br>
<i>inhuman, </i>if you know what I mean.' <br>
`So what's been going wrong around here?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Well, I suppose a lot of it is <i>me</i>,' the control panel said. `You see, when you equip a <br>
computer with a personality, well, it's like giving him the ability to <i>feel. </i>And if we can <i>feel <br></i>then you can't expect us to do the old, soulless thing any more. I mean to say, my <br>
personality makes it impossible for me to do a robot-like job, even though essentially I<i> <br>am</i> a robot and the job I have to do <i>should </i>be done in essentially a robot-like fashion. <br>But I can't do that, I'm absentminded, I have my bad days, my moods... Does that make <br>
any sense to you?' <br>
`Of course it does,' Mishkin said. `Now, what about that part?' <br>
`It isn't inside here. It's outside.' <br>`Where outside?' <br>
`About fifteen miles away, or possibly twenty.' <br>`But what is it doing outside?' <br>
`Well, originally we had all the parts stockpiled here inside the cache. All very logical <br>
and convenient. Perhaps it was too simple for the human mind to endure, for all of a <br>sudden some humans got to thinking, &quot;What would happen if a disabled ship crashed <br>
<i>right on top of the cache</i>?&quot; That freaked everybody out, so the problem was fed to a <br>computer, and the answer came up, &quot;Decentralize!&quot; The engineers and planners nodded <br>
and said, &quot;Decentralize, <i>of course, </i>why didn't <i>we </i>think of that?&quot; So orders were cut and <br>work teams came out and stuck parts all over the area. And then everybody sat back and <br>
said, &quot;Well, <i>that's </i>OK now.&quot; And then the trouble <i>really </i>began.' <br>
`What sort of trouble?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`Well, humans had to leave the cache and go out on to the surface of Harmonia in <br>
order to get what they needed. And that meant danger. Alien planets are dangerous, you <br>know, because alien things happen on them, and one does not know how to respond, <br>
and by the time one figures out what the situation is and how to deal with it, it has <br>already come and gone and maybe killed you.' <br>
`What sort of alien things?' Mishkin asked. <br>
 <br>


<A name=4></a>`I am not allowed to mention specifics,' the computer said. `If I did, it would all get <br>
much trickier.' <br>
`Why?' <br>`Successful adaptation to alien dangers requires the broad-spectrum ability to <br>
recognize what constitutes danger and what does not. If I were to mention only one or <br>two possibilities you would become overconditioned--the so-called tunnel effect--thus <br>
limiting your perceptions of other risk situations. Besides, it isn't necessary.' <br>
`Why not?' <br>
`Because provision has been made. You will be accompanied outside by a SPER robot. <br>
If we have one in stock. There was a mix-up in the last shipment...' <br>
The control panel became silent. Mishkin said, `What...' <br>
<i>`Please</i>,' said the panel, `I'm checking the inventory.' <br>Mishkin waited. In a few moments the panel said, `Yes, we do have a SPER robot in <br>
stock.  It  came  in  the  last  shipment.  It  would  have  been  pretty  <i>gross  </i>if that had been <br>missing, too.' <br>
`What is this robot?' Mishkin asked. `What is it supposed to do?' <br>`The initials stand for Special Purpose Environmental Response robot. These machines <br>
are programmed to respond to the conditions of a specific alien world. They detect <br>whatever might constitute noxious stimuli to a human, warn him, defend him, and <br>suggest appropriate counter-measures. With a SPER robot you'll be as safe as if you were <br>
back in New York.' <br>
`Thanks a lot,' Mishkin said. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>4. Chicken Little Claims Personification most Common Sign of Impaired Sense Ratios <br>
 <br>The SPER robot was short and rectangular. His lacquered, scarlet case was most <br>
attractive. He walked on four spindly limbs and had four more on the upper part of his <br>control case. He resembled a tarantula disguised as a robot. <br>
He said to Mishkin. `OK, sonny, let's get cracking.' <br>`Will it be very dangerous?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`Piece of cake. I could do it blindfolded.' <br>`What should I watch out for?' <br>
`I'll let you know.' <br>Mishkin shrugged and followed the robot past the checkout counter and through the <br>
swinging doors out on to the surface of Harmonia. He figured that the robot knew what <br>he was doing. But Mishkin was wrong. His lack of knowledge was monstrous, ineluctable, <br>and strangely touching. Perhaps only a virgin mounted on a unicorn could have been <br>
quite so dumb as Mishkin. <br>
(Of course, his robot buddy was not exactly the last word in smart, either. Add his <br>
ignorance to Mishkin's and you get a really big negative number equal to the cases of <br>pleurisy since the beginning of the second Peloponnesian War.) <br>
Jam, hot cross buns, fellatio, the colour of lips, these were on his mind as Mishkin <br>
stepped tumulously on to the dubious surface of Harmonia. <br>
`How long do the hallucinations continue?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Why  ask  me?'  said  the  kindly  chef  with  the  battered  harmonica.  `I,  too,  am  an <br>
hallucination.' <br>
`How can I tell which things are real and which are not?' <br>`Try litmus paper,' advised Chuang-tzu. <br>
`The whole deal is this,' said the robot. `You gotta do exactly like I say--otherwise <br>
you're real dead in a hurry. Got it?' <br>
`Got it,' said Mishkin. They were strolling a purple plain. The wind was from the east at <br>
five miles an hour, and one could hear the electronic sound of birds. <br>
`When I tell you to git down,' the robot went on, `you gotta hit the deck fast. There'll <br>
be no time for blinking and stumbling. I just hope that your reflexes are in good shape.' <br>
`I thought you said it wasn't dangerous here,' Mishkin said. <br>
`So, big deal, you've caught me in a contradiction,' the robot sneered. `Maybe I had <br>
my reasons for lying to you.' <br>
`What were they?' <br>
 <br>


<A name=5></a>`Maybe I've got my reasons for not telling you,' the robot said. `Just listen to what I <br>
say now. <i>Hit it!'</i> <br>
Mishkin, too, had heard the faint, high-pitched drone. He threw himself on the grass, <br>
bruising his nose in his eagerness to comply. He could see the robot swivelling, two <br>
blasters in his metal hands. <br>
`What is it?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`Mating call of the six-legged proto-Brontostegosaurus. When the durned critters are in <br>
heat, they'll try to make it with anything.' <br>
`Can't they see that I am not an appropriate object for their affections?' <br>`Sure, but it takes a few minutes for the message to get through to their brains, since <br>
the proto-B is not exactly anyone's idea of bright. And in the meantime, you got twenty-<br>
three tons of inflamed critter squatting on your head.' <br>
`So where is it?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`It's coming,' the robot said grimly, twirling the blasters by their trigger guards. <br>The drone increased in volume and amplitude. Then Mishkin saw something that <br>
looked like a butterfly with a six-foot wingspan come fluttering past, droning merrily. It <br>ignored them and went off stage left. <br>
`What was that?' Mishkin asked. <br>`It sure as hell looked like a butterfly with a six-foot wingspan,' the robot said. <br>`That's what I thought. But you said...' <br>
`Yes, yes, yes,' the robot said testily. `It's obvious enough what happened. That <br>
butterfly critter has learned how to imitate the mating cry of the proto-B. Mimicry is a <br>
commonplace phenomenon throughout the galaxy.' <br>
`Commonplace? It took <i>you </i>by surprise.' <br>
`What's so surprising about that? It was the first time I ever encountered that butterfly <br>
critter.' <br>
`You should have known about it,' Mishkin said. <br>`Wrong. I'm programmed only to detect and cope with situations and things that'll be <br>
dangerous to humans. That big old flapper couldn't hurt you unless you tried to swallow <br>
it, so naturally enough I've got nothing on it in my memory files. You gotta realize that <br>I'm not a goddamned encyclopedia. I deal strictly with dangerous stuff, not with every <br>
damned thing that walks or swims or flies or crawls or burrows or however it happens to <br>get around. You get my meaning, son?' <br>
`I get it,' Mishkin said. `I suppose you know what you're doing.' <br>`That's what I happen to have been built for,' the robot said. `C'mon, let's get on with <br>
this promenade.' <br><b> <br> <br></b>5. The Prepared Statement <br>
 <br>`I have been having mental difficulties for some time now. I get these ideas, these <br>
images. But I don't know what is real and what is not. Sometimes I think that I've eaten <br>
and then I find that I have not. Sometimes I think that I have lived and then I find that I <br>have not. I cannot remember why I am here or what crime I stand accused of. Whatever <br>
it is, I am sure that I am innocent. I am sure that I am innocent, no matter what I have <br>done.' <br>
Mishkin looked up hopefully but found that the jury had recessed, the judge had <br>
recessed, the world had recessed, and a bored guard was thumbing through an old issue <br>of <i>Rolling Stone.</i> <br>
 <br>Mishkin came to a sudden stop. <br>
`What is it?' the robot asked. <br>`I see something up ahead.' <br>
`Big deal,' the robot sneered. `I see plenty of things up ahead. I <i>always </i>see plenty of <br>
things up ahead. Christ, <i>everybody always </i>sees plenty of things up ahead.' <br>
`This thing up ahead seems to be an animal.' <br>
`What's so impressive about that?' <br>
 <br>


<A name=6></a>The thing that Mishkin saw up ahead was roughly the size and shape of a tiger but <br>
with a shorter tail and bigger feet. It was coloured a dappled chocolate with brilliant <br>
orange stripes. It looked like a mean, hungry, and unscrupulous hallucination. <br>
`It looks dangerous,' Mishkin said. <br>
`That shows how much you know about it,' the robot told him. `That there critter is a <br>
pachynert, which is an herbivorous beast with a disposition like a cow's, only more timid.' <br>
`But the teeth.' <br>`Don't let the teeth fake you out.' <br>
`Mimicry?' <br>`That's it, ace. Now git ahold of yourself and let's move out.' <br>They continued across the purple plain. The robot, not even bothering to draw his <br>
blasters, was whistling `Elmer's Tune'. Mishkin, walking two steps behind him, was <br>humming `Valse Triste'. <br>
The pachynert turned towards them and stared with eyes the colour of coagulated <br>
yak's blood. He yawned, revealing incisors like Turkish scimitars. He stretched, showing a <br>
smooth ripple of muscle down either flank like sluggish octopi grappling beneath a thin <br>sheet of plastic. <br>
`You're sure he's herbivorous?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Nothing but grass and dandelions,' the robot said. `Although they do appreciate an <br>
occasional turnip.' <br>
`He looks pretty mean.' <br>`Nature is capable of myriad disguises.' <br>
Man and robot came closer to the beast. The pachynert laid back his ears. His tail <br>
stood out stiff and straight and high, like the indicator of a dial calibrated for trouble. He <br>
stretched out claws like the cruel, curved tines of the devil's pitchfork. He snarled--a <br>sound that prompted several peripatetic trees to close down their branches, pull up their <br>
roots, and make for quieter territory on the north forty. <br>
`Nature is overdoing it,' Mishkin said. `I could swear that that critter is about to attack <br>
us.' <br>
`Nature exaggerates,' the robot said. `That is the nature of nature.' <br>They were within ten yards of the pachynert, which stood utterly still and gave an <br>
excellent imitation of a deadly animal about to charge in a berserk manner and maim and <br>kill any human in sight--and maybe a robot and a couple of trees, too, just for the hell of <br>
it. <br>
Mishkin stopped. `Now, look,' he said, `there's something wrong about all this. I <br>
think...' <br>
`You think too much,' the robot said, in a tight, hard voice. `For God's sake, get hold of <br>
yourself, man. I am a SPER robot especially trained for this work, and I give you my <br>
word that that pitiful cow in tiger's clothing...' <br>
Just then the pachynert charged. One moment it was standing still, the next moment <br>
it had burst into a furious rush, claws and teeth gleaming golden in the afternoon glare of <br>the saffron Harmonia sun and its dull, mysterious, little red companion. The beast came <br>
with a maximum of verisimilitude, just like a hungry, feral, omnivorous beast who <br>doesn't care what it goes up against, especially if the target is of a manageable size and <br>
hasn't got much in the way of claws and teeth. <br>
`Shoo, pachynert, shoo!' the robot called out in an unconvincing voice. <br>`Hit the deck!' shouted Mishkin. <br>
`Aaaaagggrrrh!' roared the pachynert. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>6   <br>
`Tom, are you all right?' <br>
Mishkin blinked. `I'm fine.' <br>`You don't look fine.' <br>Mishkin giggled: that was a very funny remark. <br>
`What's so funny?' <br>`You're funny. I can't even see you, and that's funny.' <br>
`Drink this.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=7></a>`What is it?' <br>`Nothing. Just drink it.' <br>
`Drink nothing and you turn into nothing!' Mishkin roared. With a supreme effort he <br>
opened his eyes. He couldn't see anything. He forced himself to see things. Now what? <br>
What was the rule? Yes! <i>Reality is achieved by the indefinite enumeration of objects. <br></i>Therefore: bed table, fluorescent light, incandescent light, stove, chest, bookcase, <br>
typewriter, window, tiles, glass, bottle of milk, coffee mug, guitar, ice bucket, friend, <br>garbage bag... <i>et cetera.</i> <br>
`I have achieved reality,' Mishkin said, with quiet pride. `I'm going to be all right now.' <br>`What is reality?' <br>`One of the many possible illusions.' <br>
Mishkin burst into tears. He had wanted an exclusive reality. This was terrible, this <br>
was worse than before. Now anything... <br>
 <br>`<i>This can't be happening</i>,'<i>  </i>he thought. But there was the pachynert, like a dubious <br>
proof of its own reality, coming at him in an extremely plausible whirlwind of claws and <br>teeth. Mishkin accepted the gambit. He threw himself to one side and the beast swept <br>
past him. <br>
`Shoot!' Mishkin screamed, getting into the spirit of the thing. <br>`I am not supposed to kill herbivorous animals,' the robot said. But there was little <br>
conviction in his voice. <br>
The pachynert had wheeled around and was coming again, drooling. Mishkin jumped <br>
to the right, then to the left. The pachynert followed like his shadow. The massive jaws <br>opened. Mishkin closed his eyes. <br>
He felt a burst of heat on his face. He heard a snarl, a grunt, and the sound of <br>
something heavy falling. <br>
He opened his eyes. The robot had finally brought himself to fire and had dropped the <br>
beast neatly at Mishkin's feet. <br>
`Herbivorous,' Mishkin said, bitterly. <br>
`There is such a thing as behavioural mimicry, you know. In actual cases the imitative <br>
behaviour is carried to the point of living like the model predator, even to the point of <br>
eating flesh; which, to a herbivore, is both repugnant and indigestible.' <br>
`Do you believe any of that?' <br>
`No,' the robot said, miserably. `But I don't understand how that creature could have <br>
been left out of my memory files. This planet was under continual survey for ten years <br>
before a cache was established here. Nothing the size of that beast could have escaped <br>the probes. It is no exaggeration to say that, dangerwise, Darbis IV is as well known as <br>Earth itself.' <br>
`Wait a minute,' Mishkin said. `What planet did you say this was?' <br>`Darbis IV, the planet for which I was programmed.' <br>
`This is not Darbis IV,' Mishkin said. He felt sick, dull, doomed. `This planet is called <br>
Harmonia. They sent you to the wrong planet.' <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>7 <br>
 <br>Tired of the flow? Sick of unity? <br>
Then avail yourself of <br> <br>DIAL-AN-INTERRUPTION SERVICE! <br> <br>Choose from our full line of Pauses, Beats, Breaks, Blackouts. <br> <br>The robot chuckled--an insincere sound. `I'm afraid you're in a bit of a funk. <br>
Temporary aphasic hysteria is my diagnosis, though God knows, I'm no doctor. The <br>strain, I suppose...' <br>
Mishkin shook his head. `Figure it out for yourself. You've been wrong several times <br>
about the dangers here. Grossly wrong. Impossibly wrong.' <br>
`It <i>is </i>odd,' the robot said. `I can't think of a ready explanation.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=8></a>`I can. They've been screwing up the shipments ever since they established this cache. <br>
They simply screwed up on you. You were supposed to go to Darbis IV. But they sent you <br>
to Harmonia.' <br>
`I'm thinking,' said the robot. <br>
`Do that,' Mishkin said. <br>`I have thought,' the robot said. `We SPER robots are noted for the speed of our <br>
synaptic responses.' <br>
`Bully for you,' Mishkin said. `What conclusion have you reached?' <br>
`I think that, weighing all the available evidence, your hypothesis is the most <br>
apparently probable. I do indeed seem to have been dispatched to the wrong planet. And <br>that, of course, presents us with a definite problem.' <br>
`And that means we have to do some hard thinking.' <br>`Most assuredly. But let me point out that a creature of unknown disposition and <br>
appetites is presently approaching us.' <br>
Mishkin nodded absently. Events were moving along too fast, and he needed a plan. <br>
To save his life he had to think, even if it cost him his life. <br>
The robot was programmed for Darbis IV. Mishkin was programmed for Earth. And <br>
here they both were on Harmonia like two blind men in a boiler room. The most <br>reasonable course of action for Mishkin was to go back to the cache. There he could relay <br>the information to Earth and wait until either a replacement part or a replacement robot, <br>
or both, were shipped to Harmonia. That, however, could take months, or even years. <br>And the part he wanted was only a few miles away. <br>
Still, turning back was the safest course of action. <br>But then Mishkin thought of the conquistadors in the New World, cutting their way <br>
through endless jungle, meeting the unknown and subduing it. Was he so much less a <br>man than they? Had the unknown changed in any fundamental way since the Phoenicians <br>
took their ships beyond the Pillars of Hercules? <br>
He would never be able to face himself if he turned back now and acknowledged <br>
himself less of a man than Hanno, Cortez, Pizarro, and all of the other nuts. <br>
On the other hand, if he went on and failed he would have no self to acknowledge. <br>What he really wanted to do, he decided, was to go on and succeed but not if it meant <br>
getting killed. <br>
All in all, it was an interesting problem and one that a man might fruitfully <br>
contemplate for quite some time. A few weeks' thought might well bring him the correct <br>answer and spare him untold... <br>
`The creature is approaching rather rapidly,' the robot said. <br>`Well? Shoot it.' <br>`Maybe it's harmless.' <br>
`Let's shoot first and think about all of that later.' <br>`Shooting is not an appropriate response to all dangerous situations,' the robot said. <br>
`It is on Earth.' <br>`It's not on Darbis IV,' the robot said. There, immobility is a much safer stratagem.' <br>
`The question is,' Mishkin said, `whether this place is more like Earth or like Darbis.' <br>`If we knew that,' the robot said, `we'd really know something.' <br>
The new menace appeared to be a worm some twenty feet long, coloured orange, with <br>
black bands around each of its segments. The worm had five heads arranged in a cluster <br>at one end. Each head had a single multifaceted eye and a deep, toothless, moist green <br>
mouth. <br>
`Anything that big has got to be dangerous,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Not on Darbis,' the robot told him. `There, the bigger they come, the nicer they are. <br>
It's the little bastards you have to watch out for.' <br>
`What do you suggest we do now?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Beats the hell out of me,' the robot said. <br>
The worm came to within ten feet of them. The mouths opened. <br>`Shoot!' Mishkin said. <br>The robot raised his blasters and fired directly at the worm's uplifted thorax. Several <br>
of the worm's heads blinked and looked annoyed. No other change could be observed. <br>The robot lifted his blasters again, but Mishkin told him to stop. <br>
`That's not going to do it,' he said. `What else do you have in mind?' <br>
 <br>


<A name=9></a>`Immobility.' <br>`To hell with that, I think we should run like crazy.' <br>
`No time,' the robot said. `Freeze!' <br>Mishkin forced himself to stand perfectly still as the worm's heads approached him. He <br>
shut his eyes tightly and listened to the following conversation: <br>
`Let's eat him, huh, Vince?' <br>
`Shaddup, Eddie, we ate a whole ormitung last night, you wanna give us indigestion?' <br>`I'm still hungry.' <br>
`So am I.' <br>`Me too.' <br>Mishkin opened his eyes and saw that the worm's five heads were talking to each <br>
other. The one named Vince was in the middle and was noticeably larger than the other <br>heads. Vince was saying, `You guys make me sick, you and your eating! Just when I get <br>
our body in shape after working out at the gym all month, you wanna go put a belly on <br>us and I say nix to that.' <br>
One of the heads snivelled, `We can eat anything we want whenever we want. Our <br>
Poppa, God rest his soul, said it was all of ours body and we was to share it equally.' <br>
`Poppa also said that I was to look after you kids,' Vince said, `because between you <br>
all you ain't got enough brains to climb a tree. And besides, Poppa never ate strangers.' <br>
`That's true.' The head turned towards Mishkin. `I'm Eddie.' <br>
The other heads also turned. `I'm Lucco.' <br>`I'm Joe.' <br>
`I'm Chico. And that's Vince. OK, Vince, we're gonna eat him now `cause there's four of <br>
us and we're tired of you always giving orders just because you're oldest, and from now <br>
on we're going to do exactly what the hell we want to do and if you don't like it you can <br>damned well lump it. OK, Vince?' <br>
<i>`Shaddap!'  </i>Vince bellowed. `If anyone does any eating around here it's going to be <br>
me.' <br>
`But how about us?' Chico whined. `Poppa said...' <br>
`Anything I eat will be for all of you,' Vince said. <br>`But we won't be able to <i>taste </i>anything unless we eat for ourselves,' Eddie said. <br>
`Tough,' Vince sneered. `I'll do the tasting for all of us.' <br>Mishkin ventured to speak. `Excuse me, Vince...' <br>
`Mr Pagliotelli to you,' Vince said. <br>`I just wanted to point out that I am a form of intelligent life, and where I come from <br>
one intelligent creature does not eat another intelligent creature except under really <br>exceptional circumstances.' <br>
`You trying to teach me manners?' Vince said. `I gotta good mind to break your back <br>
for making a remark like that. Besides, you attacked me first.' <br>
`That was before I knew you were intelligent.' <br>
`You trying to put me on?' Vince said. `Me, intelligent? I never even finished high <br>
school! Ever since Poppa died I've had to work twelve hours a day in the sheet metal <br>
shop just to keep the kids in orlotans. But at least I'm smart enough to know that I ain't <br>smart.' <br>
`You sound pretty smart to me,' Mishkin said smarmily. <br>`Oh, sure, I got a certain native shrewdness. I'm maybe as smart as any other <br>
uneducated Wop worm. But education-wise...' <br>
`Formal education is frequently overrated,' Mishkin pointed out. <br>`Don't I know it,' Vince said. `But how else are you going to get along in the world?' <br>
`It's tough,' Mishkin admitted. <br>`You'll laugh at me when I tell you this, but what I really always wanted to do was <br>
study the violin. Isn't that funny?' <br>
`Not at all,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Can you imagine me, big stupid Vince Pagliotelli, playing stuff from <i>Aida  </i>on a <br>
goddamned <i>fiddle?</i>' <br>
`Why not?' Mishkin said. `I'm sure you have a talent.' <br>
`The way I see it,' Vince said, `I had a dream. Then life came along full-freighted with <br>
responsibilities, and I exchanged the insubstantial gossamer fabric of vision for the <br>
coarse grey cloth of--of--' <br>
 <br>


<A name=10></a>`Bread?' Mishkin suggested. <br>`Duty?' asked Chico. <br>
`Responsibility?' asked the robot. <br>`Naw, none of them's quite it,' said Vince. `An uneducated dumbell like me oughtn't to <br>
fool around with parallel constructions.' <br>
`Perhaps you could change the key terms,' the robot suggested. `Try &quot;gossamer fabric <br>
of poesy for the coarse grey cloth of the mundane&quot;.' <br>
Vince glared at the robot, then asked Mishkin, `Who's your wise-guy buddy?' <br>
`He's a SPER robot,' Mishkin said. `But he's on the wrong planet.' <br>`Well, tell him to watch his mouth. I don't let no goddamned robot talk to me that <br>
way.' <br>
`Sorry about that,' the robot said briskly. <br>`Forget it. I guess I ain't going to eat either of you. But if you want some advice you'll <br>
watch your step around here. Not everyone is as basically distractable, good-hearted, <br>and childlike as I am. Other persons in this forest would as soon eat you as look at you. <br>
They'd <i>rather </i>eat you, frankly, because you don't neither of you look so good to look at.' <br>
`What sort of things should we look out for, specifically?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`Everything, specifically,' Vince replied. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>8 <br>
 <br>Mishkin and the robot thanked the good-natured Wop worm and nodded politely to his <br>
ill-mannered brothers. They moved on through the forest, for now there seemed no other <br>
way to go. Slowly they marched, and then more rapidly, and each sensed at his footsteps <br>the sour breath and sodden cough of old mortality shuffling along behind them as usual. <br>
The robot commented on this, but Mishkin was too preoccupied to answer. <br>
They passed huge rough trees that peeked at them through amber eyes half-covered <br>
by green shades. After they had passed, the trees whispered about it to each other. <br>
`A real bunch of weirdos,' said a great elm. <br>`I think it was maybe an optical illusion,' said an oak. `Especially that metal thing.' <br>
`Oh, my head,' said a weeping willow. `What a night! Let me tell you about it.' <br> <br>Mishkin and the robot continued into the inner recesses of the deeper glooms where, <br>
wraith-like, the dim, indistinct memories of past arboreal splendours still clung in a pale <br>
miasma. (A kind of dying around the sacred shafts of vague luminescence that crept <br>broken-backed down the branches of lachrymose trees.) <br>
`It sure is gloomy in here,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Stuff like that generally does not affect me,' the robot said. `We robots tend to <br>
unemotionality. Empathy is built into us, however, so we come to experience everything <br>
vicariously, which is the same as experiencing it legitimately in the first place.' <br>
`Huh,' said Mishkin. <br>
`Because of that, I am inclined to agree with you. It is gloomy in here. It is also <br>
spooky.' <br>
 <br>The robot was a good-hearted sort and not nearly as mechanical as his appearance <br>
would lead one to believe. Years afterward, when he was quite red with rust and his <br>
hands had the telltale cracks of metal fatigue, he would speak to the robot youngsters <br>about Mishkin. `He was a quiet man,' the robot said, `and you might have thought he was <br>
a little simpleminded. But there was a directness about him and a willingness to accept <br>his own condition that was endearing in the extreme. Taken all in all, he was a man; we <br>
shall not see his like again.' <br>
The robot children said, `Sure, Grandfather,' and went away laughing behind his back. <br>
They were smooth and sharp and bright, and they thought that they were the only ones <br>who had ever been modern, and it never occurred to them that others had been so <br>before them and that others would be so after them. And if they had been told that <br>
someday they would be put back on the shelf with other pieces of discarded merchandise <br>they would have laughed all the harder. That is the way of the young robots and no <br>
amount of programming seems able to change it <br>
 <br>


<A name=11></a> <br>But that was still in the far future. Now there was the robot and there was Mishkin, <br>
journeying together into the forest, both of them filled with knowledge of the most <br>exquisitely detailed sort, none of it apropos to their situation. It was probably about this <br>
time that Mishkin came to his great realization--that knowledge is never pertinent to <br>one's needs. What you need is always something else, and a wise man builds his life <br>
around this knowledge about the lack of usefulness of knowledge. <br>
Mishkin worried around danger. He wanted to do the right thing when he faced <br>
danger. Ignorance of the appropriate action made him anxious. He was more afraid of <br>appearing ridiculous than he was of dying. <br>
`Look,' he said to the robot, `we must make up our minds. We may meet a danger at <br>
any time, and we really must decide how we will handle it.' <br>
`Do you have any suggestions?' the robot asked. <br>
`We could toss a coin,' Mishkin suggested. <br>`That,' said the robot, `is the epitome of fatalism and quite opposed to the scientific <br>
attitude we both represent. Give ourselves up to chance after all our training? It is quite <br>unthinkable.' <br>
`I don't like it much, myself,' Mishkin said, `but I think that we can agree that <i>no </i>plan <br>
of action is a disastrous course.' <br>
The robot said, `Perhaps we could decide each case upon its merits.' <br>
`Will we have time for that?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Here's the chance to find out,' the robot said. <br>
Up ahead, Mishkin saw something flat and thin and wide, like a sheet. It was coloured <br>
a mouse-grey. It floated about three feet above the ground. It was coming straight <br>
towards them, like everything else in Harmonia. <br>
`What do you think we ought to do?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`Damned if I know,' the robot said, `I was going to ask you.' <br>`I don't think we could outrun it.' <br>`I don't think immobility would do any good,' the robot said. <br>
`Should we shoot it?' <br>`Blasters don't seem to work too well on this planet. We'd probably just get it angry.' <br>
`What if we just stroll along, minding our own business,' Mishkin said. `Maybe it'll just <br>
leave us alone.' <br>
`The hope of despair,' said the robot. <br>`Do you have any other ideas?' <br>
`No.' <br>`Then let's start strolling.' <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>9   <br>
Mishkin and the robot were strolling through the forest one day in the merry, merry <br>
month of May when they happened to surprise a pair of bloodshot eyes in the merry, <br>merry month of May. <br>
 <br>Nothing is very funny when you're underneath. <br> <br>`Stand up and be counted,' Mishkin's father had said to him. So Tom Mishkin stood up <br>
to be counted, and the number was one. This was not very instructive. Mishkin never <br>
stood up to be counted again. <br>
 <br>Let's take it now from the point of view of the monster who was approaching Mishkin. <br>
Usually reliable sources tell us that the monster did not feel at all monstrous. The <br>
monster felt anxious. That is the way everyone feels except when they are drunk or high. <br>It  would  be  good  to  remember  that  when  making  any  strange  contacts:  <i>The monster <br>feels anxious. </i>Now, if only you can convince him that you too, despite being a monster, <br>
also feel anxious. The sharing of anxieties is the first step in communication. <br>
 <br>`Ouch,' said Mishkin. <br>
 <br>


<A name=12></a>`What's the matter?' asked the robot. <br>`I stubbed my toe.' <br>
`You'll never get out of this spot like that.' <br>`What should I do?' <br>
`It might be best to continue strolling.' <br> <br>The sun beat down. The forest contained many colours. Mishkin was a complicated <br>
human being with a past and a sex life and various neuroticisms. The robot was a <br>
complicated simulacrum of a man and might just as well be considered a man. The <br>creature who was approaching them was a complete unknown but can be presumed to <br>have had a certain pleasurable amount of complication about him. Everything was <br>
complicated. <br>
As Mishkin approached the monster he had various fantasies, none of which are <br>
interesting enough to record. <br>
The monster also had various fantasies. <br>
The robot never permitted himself fantasies. He was an old-fashioned, inner-directed, <br>
Protestant ethic type of robot, and he didn't hold with tomfoolery. <br>
 <br>There were drops of crystal clear water trembling on the green, pouting, heart-curved <br>
lips. Actually, they weren't drops of water at all; they were decals made in some <br>
loathsome factory in Yonkers. The children had decorated the trees with them. <br>
 <br>The monster he went astrolling. He nodded civilly to Mishkin and the robot nodded <br>
civilly to the monster as they strolled past. <br>
 <br>The monster did a double take. `What in hell was that?' he asked. <br>
`Beats the hell out of me,' said one of the perambulatory trees, who had moved back <br>
from the north forty in hopes. of making a killing on the stock exchange. <br>
 <br>`It seems to have worked,' Mishkin said. <br>`It usually does,' the robot said, `on Darbis IV.' <br>
`Do you suppose it would usually work here on Harmonia?' <br>`I don't see why not. After all, if a thing is right once, it is capable of being right an <br>
infinite number of times. The actual figure is <i>n </i>minus one, which is a very large number <br>indeed and contains only one possibility of error out of an infinity of correct actions.' <br>
`How often does that once come up?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Too damned often,' the robot told him. `It really knocks hell out of the law of <br>
averages.' <br>
`Well, then,' Mishkin said, `maybe your formula is wrong.' <br>`Not a chance of it,' the robot said. `The theory is right, even if it usually doesn't work <br>
out in practice.' <br>
`I suppose that's good to know,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Sure it is. It's always good to know things. Anyhow, we have another chance to test it <br>
out. Here comes another monster.' <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>10  <br>
Not everyone in the forest was capable of taking consolation from philosophy. The <br>
raemit, for example, walked along in a fog of self-loathing. The raemit knew that he was <br>utterly and completely alone. In part this was because the raemit was the only one of his <br>
species, which tended to reinforce his feeling of isolation. But the raemit also knew that <br>the responsibility for alienation resides with the individual and that circumstance, no <br>
matter how apparently normative, was merely the neutral ground against which the <br>individual worked out his own internal dramas. That was a depressing thought and also a <br>confusing one, so the raemit walked along feeling weird and spaced out and like the only <br>
raemit on Harmonia, which it was. <br>
 <br>


<A name=13></a>`What's  <i>that?</i>' the raemit asked himself. He stared  long  and  hard  at the two alien <br>
creatures. Then he said, `Hallucinations, yet. That's what having a sensitivity such as <br>
mine brings you.' <br>
The two alien creatures or hallucinations continued walking. The raemit quickly <br>
reviewed his entire life. <br>
`It's all a bag of shit,' the raemit concluded. `A raemit works all his life and what <br>
happens? He gets himself into trouble with the cops, his girlfriend leaves him, his wife <br>leaves him, and then he starts seeing hallucinations. I mean, really, <i>alien creatures, </i>what <br>
will it be next?' <br><b> <br> <br></b>11 <br>
 <br>`What I'm going to do,' said the Countess of Melba, `I am going to take the pledge.' <br>`Then for the love of God Almighty,' cried the Duke of Melba, `get on with it, <i>do </i>get on <br>
with it, and stop nattering on about it.' <br>
`I do not believe in you any more,' the Duchess of Melba said. <br>
At that instant the Duke of Melba vanished like the insubstantial thing he was and, as <br>
far as I'm concerned, always will be. <br>
 <br>Mishkin remembered something that had happened to him as a little boy on a stud <br>
ranch near Abilene. But he didn't pursue it because he couldn't see how it would help him <br>
in his present circumstances, whatever they were. <br>
 <br>`One can be on the verge of violent death,' said the robot, `and still be bored. I wonder <br>
why that is so?' <br>
`One can get damned sick of the thoughts of robots,' Mishkin replied. <br> <br>The forest died. It was an attack of the floral version of hoof and mouth disease that <br>
had wracked such ruin around the countryside. Nothing for it, we will simply have to get <br>along without that forest. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>12 <br>
 <br>Mishkin was walking through a large parking lot. It was a beige parking lot with green <br>
and yellow stripes. The parking meters were mauve, and the crumpled old newspapers <br>were scarlet and bronze. It was a humdinger of a parking lot. <br>
`This seems to be a parking lot,' Mishkin remarked. <br>`It does seem so, doesn't it?' the Duke of Melba replied, twirling the ends of his long <br>
blond moustaches. `Reminds me of a story. Rather good story. Friend of mine was <br>staying at a friend's house in Surrey. Cotswolds, actually. He had retired for the night in <br>
a room that was purported to be haunted. My friend thought that a rather piquant touch, <br>but he didn't buy it, of course. No one does. Well, then. My friend set the guttering <br>
candle down by his bedside--the place had no electricity, you see; or rather, it <i>did </i>have <br>electricity but a sudden storm had sent it all kaput. He was just settling in for the night, <br>in quite a calm mood, when...' <br>
`Excuse me,' Mishkin said. `Who are you?' <br>`Duke of Melba,' said the Duke of Melba. `But call me Clarence. I don't hold with all of <br>
that title nonsense. I don't believe I caught your name.' <br>
`That's because I didn't throw it,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Oh, I say, that's rather good. Original?' <br>`It was, once,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Very good!' <br>`My name is Mishkin,' Mishkin said. `I don't suppose you happened to see a robot <br>
anywhere around here?' <br>
`I didn't actually.' <br>`Strange. He just vanished.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=14></a>`Nothing strange about that,' the Duke of Melba said. `Just a minute ago my wife <br>
remarked that she didn't believe in me, and lo and behold, I just vanished. Strange, isn't <br>
it?' <br>
`Very strange,' Mishkin said. `But I suppose it does happen.' <br>
`I suppose it does,' Clarence said. `After all, it just happened to me. Damned funny <br>
feeling, vanishing.' <br>
`What does it feel like?' <br>`Hard to put your finger on it. A sort of <i>insubstantial </i>thing, if you know what I mean.' <br>
You're sure you didn't see my robot?' <br>`Reasonably sure. I suppose you were fond of him?' <br>`We've been through a lot together.' <br>
`Old war buddies,' the Duke said, nodding and untwisting his moustaches. `Nothing <br>
quite like old war buddies. Or old wars. I remember a time outside of Ypres...' <br>
`Excuse me,' Mishkin said. `I don't know where you came from, but I think that I must <br>
warn you that you have vanished or been vanished into a place of considerable danger.' <br>
`It's  uncommonly  kind  of  you  to  warn  me,' the Duke said. `But, actually, I'm in no <br>
danger at all. The danger number is your movie, whereas I am in an entirely different <br>
and much less satisfactory sequence. Projection doth make mockery of us all, as the poet <br>said. Whimsical anachronism is more my line of country, old chap. Now, as I was <br>saying...' <br>
The Duke of Melba interrupted himself by stopping. A shadow of discontent had just <br>
crossed his mind. He was unsatisfied with his delineation of himself. All that he had <br>
presented so far was the fact that he had long blond moustaches, sounded vaguely <br>English, and seemed a little silly. This seemed to him insufficient. He decided to rectify <br>
the situation at once. <br>
 <br>The Duke of Melba was a large and impressive individual. His eyes were a frosty blue. <br>
He bore a resemblance to Ronald Colman, though the Duke was handsomer, more bitter, <br>and possessed more cool. His hands were finely shaped with long tapering fingers. <br>
Noticeable also were the little crow's-feet at the corners of his eyes. These, together with <br>the feathering of grey at his temples, did nothing to detract from his attractiveness; quite <br>
the contrary, they gave him a bold, brooding, weather-beaten appearance that the <br>opposite sex (as well as many members of his own sex, not all of them gay) found <br>
distinctively attractive. Taken all in all, he was the man you would pick to advertise your <br>oldest scotch, your best line of clothing, your most expensive motorcars. <br>
The Duke thought that over and found it good. A few things were missing. So he gave <br>
himself the faintest suggestion of a limp, just for the hell of it and because he had always <br>considered a limp to be mysterious and attractive. <br>
When he was through, the Duke of Melba was fair pleased. The only thing that galled <br>
him was the fact that his wife had caused him to vanish. That seemed to him a very <br>
castrating thing to do. <br>
 <br>`Do you know?' he said to Mishkin, `I have a wife. The Duchess of Melba, you know.' <br>`Oh. That's nice,' Mishkin said. <br>
`In a way it is, I suppose. But the thing is, I don't believe in her.' <br>The Duke smiled to himself: an attractive smile. Then he frowned: an attractive frown, <br>
for his wife appeared suddenly in front of him. <br>
The Duchess of Melba took one good look at the Duke, then swiftly changed her <br>
appearance. Her hair went from grey to chestnut brown with red highlights. She became <br>
tall, slender, with medium-large boobies and a delicious ass. She gave herself delicate <br>bones in her wrists, a faint, blue vein that throbbed in her forehead, a beauty mark <br>
shaped like a star on her left cheek, fantastic legs, a Pierre Cardin outfit, a Hermes <br>handbag, shoes by Riboflavin, a tantalizing smile smiled by long, slim lips that didn't <br>
need any lipstick because they were naturally red (it ran in the family), a solid gold <br>Dunhill lighter, emaciated cheeks, raven black hair with blue highlights, and a big <br>sapphire ring instead of a gold-plated wedding band. <br>
The Duke and the Duchess looked at each other and found each other admirable. They <br>
strolled away arm and arm into the nowhere they had made each other vanish into. <br>
 <br>


<A name=15></a>`All the best,' Mishkin called after them. He looked around the parking lot but he <br>
couldn't find his car. It was one of those days. <br>
At last a parking lot attendant came ambling up to him - a short fat man in a green <br>
jumper with the words AMRITSAR HIGH SCHOOL ALL-STARS embroidered over his left <br>
breast pocket. The attendant said, `Your ticket, sir? No tickee, no caree.' <br>
`Here it be,' said Mishkin, and from the transverse pocket of his slung pouch he <br>
removed a piece of red pasteboard. <br>
<i>`Don't let him take that ticket!' </i>a voice called out. <br>
`Who is that?' Mishkin asked. <br>`I am your SPER robot presently disguised as a 1968 Rover TC 2000. You are under <br>
the influence of a hallucinating drug. Do not give the attendant that ticket!' <br>
`Give ticket,' said the attendant. <br>`Not so fast,' said Mishkin. <br>
`Yes, <i>fast</i>,' said the attendant, and reached out. <br>It seemed to Mishkin that the attendant's fingers split into a mouth. Mishkin stepped <br>
back. Very slowly the attendant came towards him. Now he could be seen as a kind of <br>large snake with wings and a forked tail. Mishkin avoided him without trouble. <br>
Mishkin was back in the forest (That damned forest!) The robot was standing beside <br>
him. A large, winged snake was advancing very slowly on Mishkin. <br><b> <br> <br></b>13  <br>
The snake had a mouth that secreted fantasies. His very breath was illusion. His eyes <br>
were hypnotic, and the movement of his wings cast spells. Even his size and shape were <br>matters of illusion, for he was capable of changing himself from gigantic to infinitesimal. <br>
But when the snake had made himself tinier than a fly, Mishkin deftly captured him and <br>shut him up in an aspirin bottle. <br>
`What will you do with him?' the robot asked. <br>
`I will keep him,' said Mishkin, `until it is the proper time for me to live in fantasies.' <br>`Why is that time not now?' the robot asked. <br>
`Because I am young now,' Mishkin replied, `and  it  is  time  for  me  to  be  living <br>
adventures and to be making actions and suffering reactions. Later, much later, when my <br>
fires have dimmed and my memories have lost their bright edge, then I shall release this <br>creature. The winged snake and I will walk together into that final illusion that is death. <br>
But that time is not now.' <br>
`Well spoken,' the robot said. But he wondered who was speaking with Mishkin's <br>
mouth. <br>
So they kept going across the forest. The aspirin bottle was sometimes very heavy, <br>
sometimes light. It was evident that the creature had power. But it was not enough to <br>
dissuade  Mishkin  from  the  work  that  lay  ahead  of  him.  He  didn't  know  what  this  work <br>was, but he knew that it didn't lie in an aspirin bottle. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>14 <br>
 <br>Mishkin and the robot came to a ravine. There was a plank across the two sides of the <br>
ravine. Looking down, one could see a tiny thread of water thousands of feet below. <br>
This was noteworthy, for the ravine had a natural grandeur and attractiveness. But <br>
more striking by far was the plank across the two sides of the ravine. There was a table <br>on the plank, near the middle. There were four chairs at the table, and four men sat in <br>
the chairs. They were playing a game of cards. They had full ashtrays beside them. There <br>was an unshielded light, suspended by nothing visible, burning palely above their heads. <br>
Mishkin approached and listened to them for a while. <br>`Open for a dollar.' <br>`Fold.' <br>
`Call.' <br>`Raise.' <br>
`And another dollar.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=16></a>They played with concentration but with evident fatigue Their faces were stubbly and <br>
pale, and their rolled-up sleeves were grimy. They were drinking beer from no-neck <br>
bottles and eating thick sandwiches. <br>
Mishkin walked up and said, `Excuse me.' <br>
The men looked up. One of them said, `What's up, bub?' <br>`I'd like to get by,' Mishkin said. <br>
They stared at him as if he were crazy. `So walk around,' one of the men said. <br>`I can't,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Why not? You lame or something?' <br>`Not at all,' Mishkin said. `But the fact is, if I tried to walk around I would fall into the <br>
ravine. You see, there's no room between the chairs and the edge; or rather, there's an <br>
inch or two, but my balance isn't good enough for me to risk it.' <br>
The men stared at him. `Phil, did you ever hear anything like that?' <br>
Phil shook his head. `I've heard some weird ones, Jack, but this takes the fur-lined <br>
pisspot for sure. Eddie, what do you think?' <br>
`He's gotta be drunk. Huh, George?' <br>`Hard to say. What do you think, Burt?' <br>
`I  was  just  going  to  ask  Jack  what  he  thought,'  Burt  looked  at  Mishkin.  In  a  not <br>
unkindly manner, he said, `Look, fella, me and the boys are having this private poker <br>game here in room 2212 of the Sheraton-Hilton, and you come in and say that you'll fall <br>
over the edge of a <i>ravine </i>if you walk around us, when the fact of the matter is that you <br>shouldn't be in our room in the first place, but being here, you could walk around us all <br>
day without anything happening to you since this happens to be a hotel not a ravine.' <br>
`I think you are labouring under a delusion,' Mishkin said. `It happens that you are not <br>
in a hotel room in the Sheraton-Hilton.' <br>
George, or possibly Phil, said, `Then where are we?' <br>
`You are seated at a table situated on a plank over a ravine on a planet called <br>
Harmonia.' <br>
`You,' said Phil, or possibly George, `are out of your ever-loving mind. Maybe we had a <br>
few drinks, but we do know what hotel we signed into.' <br>
`I don't know how it happened,' Mishkin said, `but you are not where you think you <br>
are.' <br>
`We're on a plank over a ravine, huh?' Phil said. <br>
`Exactly.' <br>`So how come we think we're in room 2212 of the Sheraton-Hilton?' <br>
`I don't know,' Mishkin said. `Something very strange seems to have happened.' <br>`Sure, it has,' Burt said. `It's happened to your head. You're crazy.' <br>`If anyone is crazy,' Mishkin said, `you people are crazy.' <br>
The poker players laughed. George said, `Sanity is a matter of consensus. We say it's <br>
a hotel room and we outvote you four to one. That makes you crazy.' <br>
Phil said, `This damned city is full of nuts. Now they come up to your hotel room and <br>
tell you it's balanced on a plank over a ravine.' <br>
`Will you let me get by?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Suppose I do; where will you go?' <br>
`To the other side of the ravine.' <br>`If you go around us,' Phil said, `you'll only come to the other side of the room.' <br>`I don't think so,' Mishkin said. `And, although I wish to be tolerant of your opinions, in <br>
this case I can see that they are based upon a false assumption. Let me get by and you <br>can see for yourself.' <br>
Phil yawned and stood up. `I was going to the crapper, anyhow, so you can get by me. <br>
But when you reach the end of the room, will you turn around again like a good boy and <br>
get the hell out of here?' <br>
`If it's a room, I promise to leave at once.' <br>
Phil stood up, took two steps back from the table, and fell into the ravine. His scream <br>
echoed and re-echoed as he fell into the depths. <br>
George said, `Those goddamned police sirens are getting on my nerves.' <br>
Mishkin edged past the table, holding on to its edge, and made it to the other side of <br>
the ravine. The robot followed. Once they were both safe, Mishkin called out, `Did you <br>
see? It was a ravine.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=17></a>George said, `While he's at it, I hope Phil gets Tom out of the crapper. He's been there <br>
about half an hour.' <br>
`Hey,' Burt said, `where did the nut go?' <br>The card players looked around. `He's gone,'  George  said.  `Maybe  he  went  into  a <br>
closet.' <br>
`Nope,' Burt said, `I've been watching the closet.' <br>
`Did he jump out a window?' <br>`You can't open the windows.' <br>
`Too much,' George said. `That's really one for the books... Hey, Phil, hurry up!' <br>`You can never get him out of the crapper,' Burt said. `How about a little gin rummy?' <br>`You're on,' Burt said, and shuffled the cards. <br>
Mishkin watched them for a few minutes then continued into the forest. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>15  <br>
Mishkin asked the robot, `What was that all about?' <br>
`I am reviewing the information now,' the robot said. He was silent for a few minutes. <br>
Then he said, `They did it with <br>
mirrors.' <br>
`That seems unlikely.' <br>`All hypotheses concerning the present sequence of events are unlikely,' the robot <br>
said. `Would you prefer me to say <br>
that we and the card players met at a discontinuity point in the space-time continuum <br>
in which two planes of reality intersected?' <br>
`I think I would prefer that,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Simpleminded sod. Shall we go on?' <br>`Let's. I just hope the car works.' <br>`It had better work,' the robot said. `I spent three hours rewiring the generator.' <br>
Their car--a white Citroen with mushroom-shaped tyres and a hydraulic tail-light <br>
system--was parked just ahead of them in a little clearing. Mishkin got in and started up. <br>
The robot stretched out on the back seat. <br>
`What are you doing?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`I thought I'd take a little nap.' <br>`Robots never sleep.' <br>
`Sorry. I meant that I was going to take a little pseudo-nap.' <br>`That's OK,' Mishkin said, putting the car into gear and taking off. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>16  <br>
Mishkin drove across a green and pleasant meadow for several hours. He came at last <br>
into a narrow dirt road that led between giant willow trees and then into a driveway. In <br>front of him was a castle. He awakened the robot from his pseudo-snooze. <br>
`Interesting,' said the robot. `Did you notice the sign?' <br>In front of the castle, tacked up on a young spruce tree, was a sign reading: <br>
IMAGINARY CASTLE. <br>
`What does it mean?' Mishkin asked. <br>`It means that some people have the decency to state a simple truth, and thus to <br>
avoid confusing passersby. An imaginary castle is one that has no counterpart in <br>objective reality.' <br>
`Let's go in and take a look at it,' Mishkin said. <br>`But I have just explained to you. The castle is not real. There is literally nothing to <br>
see.' <br>
`I want to see it, anyhow,' Mishkin said. <br>`You have already read the sign.' <br>
`But maybe that's a lie or a joke.' <br>`If you can't believe what is written plain as day,' the robot said, `then how can you <br>
believe anything? You have observed, I hope, that the sign is exceptionally well made, <br>
 <br>


<A name=18></a>and that the lettering is plain, forthright, and not at all flamboyant. In the right-hand <br>corner is the seal of the Department of Public Works, an unimpeachable and businesslike <br>
organization whose motto is <i>Noli me tangere. </i>It is evident that they have classified this <br>castle as a public service so that no one will walk into it thinking that he is in a real <br>
castle. Or isn't the Department of Public Works a reliable service to you?' <br>
`It is a very acceptable reference,' Mishkin said. `But maybe the seal is a forgery.' <br>
`That is typically paranoid thinking,' the robot said. `First, despite its solid and <br>
commonplace air of reality, you consider the sign a lie or a joke (the two are essentially <br>
the same thing). Then, when you learn the source of this so-called &quot;joke&quot;, you think that <br>perhaps it is a forgery. Suppose I succeed in proving to you the authenticity and sincerity <br>of the sign makers? I suppose that you would insist, despite the accepted principle of <br>
Ockham's razor, that the sign makers are imaginary, or deluded, and that the castle is <br>real.' <br>
`It is simply a rather unusual thing,' Mishkin said, `to come across a castle and to be <br>
told that it is imaginary.' <br>
`I see nothing unusual about it,' the robot said. `Since the latest revision of the truth-<br>
in-advertising statutes, ten gods, four major religions, and eighteen hundred and twelve <br>
cults to date have been labelled imaginary in accordance with the law.' <br><b> <br> <br></b>17 <br>
 <br>Guided by the sacristan-a short cheerful old man with a white beard and a wooden <br>
leg--Mishkin and the robot toured the Imaginary Castle. They went down long stuffy <br>
passageways and through short draughty cross passageways, past factory-tarnished <br>suits of armour and pre-faded, pre-shrunk tapestries depicting virgins and unicorns in <br>
ambiguous poses. They inspected the punishment cells where make-believe prisoners <br>pretended to suffer from the vile incursions of fraudulent racks, ersatz pincers, and fake <br>thumbscrews wielded by stoop-shouldered torturers whose commonplace horn-rimmed <br>
glasses robbed them of any pretence to credibility. (Only the pasteurized blood was real, <br>and not even that was convincing.) They passed the armoury where snub-nosed <br>
demoiselles typed triplicate requests for the latest model Holy Grail swords and Big <br>Barbarian spears. <br>
They went to the battlements and saw the vats of Smith &amp; Wesson polyunsaturated oil <br>
suitable for low-temperature anointing or high-temperature boiling. They looked into the <br>
chapel, where a boyish, red-haired priest made jokes in Sanskrit to a congregation of <br>Peruvian tin miners, while Judas, crucified by a contrived clerical error, looked down, <br>bewildered, from a Symbolist cross of rare woods that had been especially selected for <br>
the spiritual sensibility of their textures. <br>
Finally, they came to the great banquet hall, within which was a table loaded with <br>
Broasted chickens, mugs of Orange Julius, chili dogs, clams on the half shell, and two-<br>inch slices of roast beef done crisp on the outside and rare on the inside. And there were <br>
platters of soft ice cream, and trays of pizza, both Neapolitan and Sicilian, all of them <br>with extra cheese and sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, and capers. There were foil-<br>
wrapped heroes and poorboys, and combination, multiple-decker sandwiches of <br>pastrami, tongue, corned beef, chopped liver, lox, cream cheese, onions, coleslaw, <br>potato salad, and dill and half-sour pickles. And there were great tureens of kreplach <br>
soup, and chicken soup with noodles. And there were cauldrons filled with lobster <br>Cantonese, and platters piled high with sweet and sour spareribs, and waxed-paper <br>
containers of pressed duck with walnuts. And there were roast stuffed turkeys with <br>cranberry sauce, cheeseburgers, shrimps in black bean sauce, and much more besides. <br>
`What happens to me if I eat some of this?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Nothing,' the sacristan said. `Imaginary food cannot nourish you; but it also cannot <br>
make you sick.' <br>
`Does it have a mental effect?' Mishkin asked, sampling a chili dog. <br>`It must have a mental effect,' the sacristan pointed out, `since imaginary food is, <br>
literally, food for the mind. The precise effect varies with the intelligence and <br>sophistication of the partaker. Among the ignorant and gullible, for example, imaginary <br>
food tends to be quite nourishing. Pseudo-nourishing, of course, but the nervous system <br>
 <br>


<A name=19></a>cannot differentiate between real and imaginary events. Some idiots have managed to <br>live for years and years on this insubstantial stuff, thus demonstrating once again the <br>
effects of belief upon the human body.' <br>
`It tastes good,' Mishkin said, gnawing on a turkey drumstick and helping himself to a <br>
portion of cranberry sauce. <br>
`Of course,' the sacristan said. `Imaginary food always has the best taste.' <br>
Mishkin ate and ate, and enjoyed himself hugely. Then, heavy-laden, he went over to <br>
a couch and lay down. The gentle insubstantiality of the couch lulled him to sleep. <br>
 <br>The sacristan turned to the robot and said, `Now the shit is really going to hit the fan.' <br>`Why?' the robot asked. <br>
`Because, having partaken of imaginary nourishment, that young man is about to have <br>
imaginary dreams.' <br>
`Is that bad?' the robot asked. <br>`It tends to get confusing.' <br>
`Perhaps I should wake him up,' the robot said. <br>`Of course you should; but first, why don't we turn on the tube and tune in on his <br>
dream?' <br>
`Can we do that?' <br>`You'd better believe it,' the sacristan said. He crossed the room and turned on the <br>
television set. <br>
`That wasn't there before,' the robot said. <br>
`One nice thing about an imaginary castle,' the sacristan pointed out, `is that you can <br>
have pretty much what you want when and where you want it, with no necessity for <br>
tedious explanations that are always something of a bringdown.' <br>
`Why don't you focus that screen?' <br>
`It is in focus,' the sacristan said. `Here come the titles.' <br>On the screen the following credits appeared: <br> <br>Robert Sheckley Enterprises Presents <br>MISHKIN'S IMAGINARY DREAM <br>
A Neo-Menippean Rodomontade <br>Produced in Can Pep' des Correu Studios, Ibiza <br>
 <br>`What was that all about?' the robot asked. <br>
`Just the usual crap,' said the sacristan. `Here comes the dream.' <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>18 <br>
 <br>Mishkin was strolling along contemplating the nature of reality when a voice said to <br>
him, `Hi.' <br>
Mishkin started uncontrollably and looked all around. He saw no one. He was on a flat, <br>
level plain, and there was no object more than one foot high for at least five miles in any <br>
direction for anyone to hide behind. <br>
Mishkin did not lose his cool. He answered, `How do you do?' <br>`Fine, thank you. And yourself?' <br>
`Quite well, all things considered. Have we met before?' <br>`I don't think so,' the voice said. `Still, you can never tell, can you?' <br>
`No, you can't,' Mishkin said. `What are you doing around here?' <br>`I live around here.' <br>
`It seems like a nice place.' <br>`It's all right,' the voice said. `But the winters are impossibly cold and damp.' <br>
`Really?' <br>`Yes. I suppose you're a tourist?' <br>`More or less,' Mishkin said. `It's the first time I've been here.' <br>
`How do you like it?' <br>`It's very nice. I haven't seen much yet, but what I've seen seems very nice.' <br>
`I'm used to it all,' the voice said. `But I suppose that's because I live here.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=20></a>`Probably,' Mishkin said. `That's how I usually feel at home.' <br>`Where <i>is </i>your home, by the way?' <br>
`Earth,' Mishkin said. <br>`Big red planet.' <br>
`Small green planet.' <br>`I think I've heard of it. Yellowstone National Park?' <br>
`That's the place.' <br>`You're a long, long way from home.' <br>
`I suppose I am,' Mishkin said, `But, of course, I enjoy travelling.' <br>`Did you come by spaceship?' <br>`Yes, I did.' <br>
`I'll bet that was interesting.' <br>`Yes, it was.' <br>
There was a silence. Mishkin didn't know how to bring up the fact that he couldn't see <br>
whom he was talking to. He realized that he should have mentioned it earlier. Now he <br>
would appear foolish if he brought it up. <br>
`Well,' the voice said, `I suppose I'd better be getting along.' <br>
`It's been nice talking to you,' Mishkin said. <br>`I've enjoyed it, too. I wonder if you've noticed that I'm invisible?' <br>`As a matter of fact, I have. I suppose that you can see me?' <br>
`Yes, I can. We invisibles can see visible things such as yourself very well. Except for <br>
the unfortunate few among us who are blind, of course.' <br>
`Can you see each other?' <br>`No, of course not. We wouldn't be really invisible if we could.' <br>
`I hadn't thought of that,' Mishkin said. `I suppose it's a bother?' <br>`Definitely,' the invisible said. `We pass each other in the streets without noticing each <br>
other. That hurts people's feelings, even though  they  know  it  can't  be  helped.  And <br>invisibility makes falling in love difficult, too. For example, if I meet a nice young lady at <br>the Saturday night YMCA dance I don't know if she's cute or a complete dog. And one <br>
hates to ask. I know that that sort of thing shouldn't matter, but it always seems to, <br>doesn't it?' <br>
`It does on Earth,' Mishkin said. `But I suppose there are advantages to being <br>
invisible.' <br>
`Oh, yes. We used to get a lot of pleasure out of springing out at people and saying <br>
boo. But now, everyone around here knows about us and no one is frightened anymore, <br>
they just tell us to go fuck off.' <br>
`I suppose that being invisible is an advantage when you go hunting?' <br>`Not really. We invisibles tend to be pretty heavy-footed, so we make a lot of noise <br>
when we hunt, unless we stand perfectly still. Because of this we tend to hunt only a <br>single species of animal. We call them the Unhearables, since they are all totally deaf. <br>
Against them our invisibility is a great advantage. But the Unhearables make rather <br>mediocre eating, even potted and served with bechamel sauce.' <br>
`I always thought that an invisible creature would have an edge over everything else,' <br>
Mishkin said. <br>
`That's what everybody thinks,' the invisible said. `But really, invisibility is just a kind <br>
of handicap.' <br>
`That's too bad,' Mishkin said politely. <br>
There was a short, uncomfortable silence. <br>`What do you look like?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`Can't say, old man. Invisible, you know. Makes shaving difficult. Watch out!' <br>Mishkin had blundered into an invisible object and had given himself a severe rap on <br>
the forehead. He walked more slowly now, with one hand stretched out in front of him. <br>
`How did you see that invisible object?' he asked. <br>
`Didn't see it, old man,' the invisible told him. `Saw the identification marker.' <br>Looking around him, Mishkin could see various metal plaques set into the ground. <br>
These were engraved with self-translating characters (required by interstellar law), which <br>
made them as easy to read as English is to the average literate Englishman. <br>
Ahead of him were plaques marked, `Rock', `Clump of Cactus', `Abandoned Volkswagen <br>
Microbus', `Unconscious Person', `Withered Fig Tree', `Lost Dutchman Mine', and the like. <br>
 <br>


<A name=21></a>`That's very considerate,' Mishkin said, threading his way between `Trash Heap' and <br>
`Tourist Office'. <br>
`It's purely selfish,' the invisible said. `We got tired of bumping into those things <br>
ourselves.' <br>
`How did those things become invisible?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Some sort of contamination. For a while everything is all right, we go about our <br>
business, get our work done. Then the objects we associate with begin to grow dim, and <br>then they vanish entirely. For example, one fine morning a bank president finds that he <br>
can't find his own bank. No one knows if the street lights are on or off. Invisible milkmen <br>try to deliver invisible milk in invisible bottles to the invisible occupants of invisible <br>houses. The results are comico-pathetic. Everything gets a bit mixed up.' <br>
`So you put out the plaques,' Mishkin said. <br>`No, we use the plaques only for outlying areas. Inside the city limits, we paint <br>
everything with visible paint.' <br>
`Does that solve the problem?' <br>
`It's a big help, but the system has certain flaws. Repainted paintings suffer an <br>
inevitable aesthetic loss. Painted people often have skin reactions. But the major flaw is <br>
that the visible paint itself tends to become invisible after varying lengths of contact with <br>invisible objects. We try to handle this by a continual repainting programme based upon <br>statistical, positional, and temporal charts of all objects in the city. But even given the <br>
efficiency of our programme, many things still get lost. There are incalculable variables, <br>you see: despite stringent quality controls, no two batches of visible paint are completely <br>
identical in their characteristics. Each batch is affected uniquely by the different <br>combinations, intensities, and durations of temperature-humidity interactions. The <br>
changing planetary and lunar relationships may also be a factor. And there are other <br>factors still under investigation.' <br>
The invisible sighed. `We try not to give way to despair. Our scientists work continually <br>
on the project of making ourselves permanently visible. Some call it a visionary and <br>unrealistic hope; but we know that others, such as yourself, have achieved the bliss of <br>
visibility. So why not us?' <br>
`I never thought it would be like this,' Mishkin said. `I had always thought that it would <br>
be fun to be invisible.' <br>
`Don't you believe it,' the invisible said. `Invisibility is just about the same as being <br>
blind.' <br><b> <br> <br></b>19 <br>
 <br>Desert gave way to semi-desert. Mishkin and the robot walked through a flat, arid <br>
wasteland, past lost dirt roads, stunted shrubs, and an occasional deserted frame house. <br>
They crossed a little rise and saw a man in a tuxedo with a tall black hat on his head <br>
sitting on a black metal suitcase. In front of him were rusty railroad tracks that stretched <br>
for fifty feet on either side. <br>
`Christ,' the robot said, `another creep.' <br>
`Don't be rude,' Mishkin told him. He walked up and greeted the stranger. <br>`About time someone came along,' the stranger said. `I've been sitting here for two <br>
days, and I don't mind telling you it's getting pretty boring.' <br>
`What are you waiting for?' Mishkin asked. <br>`The 12:10 from Yuma,' the stranger said, turning to the left and looking down the <br>
fifty feet of track. `But they don't run the trains on time any more.' <br>
`I don't think this particular train runs at all any more,' Mishkin said. <br>
`I wouldn't be surprised,' the stranger said. `It does seem unlikely, taking everything <br>
into consideration. But I sure as hell can't walk any more. And maybe something'll <br>
happen and the train <i>will </i>come by. I've seen stranger things happen. Strange things do <br>happen for me. I suppose you know who I am.' <br>
`I'm afraid that I don't,' Mishkin said. <br>
`You must be pretty ignorant because I'm pretty famous. In this manifestation I am <br>
Ronsard the Magnificent, and I am probably the greatest magician the universe has ever <br>
seen.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=22></a>`Lotta crap,' the robot mumbled. <br>`Don't let appearances deceive you,' Ronsard said. `There is a reason why I am <br>
currently playing whistle-stops and waiting for nonexistent trains in freaky places. Karma <br>catches up with us all, eh? But something always turns up. Would you like to witness <br>
some magic?' <br>
`I would like that very much,' Mishkin said. <br>
`It's a lotta bullshit,' the robot said. <br>Ronsard ignored the sullen mechanical. `For my first number I will do the rabbit trick.' <br>
`I've seen it,' the robot said. <br>`I haven't,' Mishkin said. `So kindly shut up.' <br>The robot leaned back and crossed his arms. A mean, sceptical smile was upon his <br>
metallic face, and the very angles of his body spelled disbelief. Mishkin leaned forward <br>eagerly, his hands clasped around his knees. The very attitude of his body spelled <br>
willingness to be astonished. <br>
Ronsard opened up his suitcase and took out a complicated control board, two <br>
automobile batteries, a jumble of wires, three circuit boards, a flask filled with a murky-<br>looking fluid, and a small accelerometer. He hooked up wires between these objects and <br>
connected them to a red and black lead that he attached to the brim of his hat. He took <br>out a circuit tester and tested. Then he turned to Mishkin. <br>
`You will observe, my dear sir, that the hat is empty,' He showed his hat to Mishkin <br>
and the robot, who yawned. <br>
`Now, then,' the magician said. He took a white satin cloth from his suitcase and laid it <br>
over the hat. Then he made passes with his right hand and said, `Rje-Sgampo Rinpoche-<br>hi Lam Mchog Rinpoche Hi Hrheng-wa Zhes Bya-wa Bzhugs-so.' At last he kicked the <br>
control board with his right heel. <br>
There was a crackle of sparks and a loud hissing sound. Gauges spun then returned to <br>
normal. <br>
The magician removed the cloth. From the hat he pulled a live rabbit. He put it down <br>
on the ground and bowed. <br>
Mishkin applauded. `He does it with mirrors,' sneered the robot. <br>The rabbit tried to climb back into the hat. The magician pushed it away. <br>
`All magicians pull rabbits out of hats,' the robot said. <br>`It's part of the warm-up,' said the magician. <br>
`There's nothing supernatural about what I do,' said the magician. `I deal in illusions, <br>
which are appearances created by careful preparation, skill, and the right equipment. <br>
That's all there is to it.' <br>
`What exactly is an illusion?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Everything phenomenal can be considered an illusion,' the magician said. `Next, I am <br>
going to do a card trick. Don't groan, sir. [This was directed to the robot.] I know that it <br>doesn't seem like much. But my stage effects are carefully planned as to intensity and <br>
cumulative effect. Card tricks are amusing, though not fantastical or astonishing, and <br>they allow a heightening of receptivity before the major events of the evening (the <br>
afternoon, actually). Accordingly...' <br>
The magician took a deck of cards from his suitcase. <br>
`Here we have a deck of ordinary playing cards. I will now pass these cards among <br>
you. You may examine them to your heart's content. You will find them factory sealed, <br>unmarked in any way.' <br>
He gave the deck to Mishkin, who broke open the package and looked them over. The <br>
robot also examined them. While they were doing this, the magician had opened his <br>
suitcase again and had taken from it three parabolic mirrors on tripods, a battery-<br>operated computer complete with batteries, and a small radarscope. He set up the <br>
mirrors to face in various directions, and connected them to the radar-scope and the <br>computer. He took the cards and fanned them in front of one of the mirrors. He punched <br>
information into the computer. Then he waited until the radarscope gave off a high-<br>pitched beep. <br>
The magician took a rickety wooden folding table from the suitcase and set it up in <br>
front of them. He put the deck of cards face down on the table. <br>
 <br>


<A name=23></a>`Note that I do not at any time retain any physical hold on the cards, so I cannot be <br>
accused of forcing a choice on you. Now I would like you to shuffle the cards thoroughly <br>
and select one. Do not let me see the card you select. Remember the card.' <br>
Mishkin and the robot did as they were told. Mishkin shuffled three times, and the <br>
robot shuffled twenty-seven times, randomizing the cards past any possibility of inherent <br>or adherent patterns. Then they picked a card. <br>
`Look at the card carefully, fix it in your memories. Now return the card to the deck <br>
and shuffle again.' <br>
Again Mishkin shuffled three times and the robot shuffled twenty-seven times. (The <br>
robot would have made an excellent Canasta shuffler and had in fact been offered that <br>lucrative position at the North Miami Beach Community Centre.) <br>
`Now,' the magician said, `take the number of your card--counting eleven for all court <br>
cards-and multiply by seventeen. If the resultant is even, add seven, if odd, subtract <br>
two. Determine the square root of the new number to three places. Take the last digit, <br>add nine, and factor it according to suit -black suits are imaginary numbers, red suits are <br>
real numbers. Add to this any real number you please between one and ninety-nine. <br>Have you followed all that?' <br>
`Easily,' said the robot. <br>`What is the number?' <br>`Eighty-seven.' <br>
The magician fed information into the computer, which began to spew paper. The <br>
magician studied the readout. <br>
`Your card is the Jack of Diamonds.' <br>`Correct,' said the robot, and Mishkin hastily nodded. <br>
`Still... Everybody does card tricks,' the robot said. <br>`I never claimed not to be everybody,' the magician said. <br>
`I suppose he'll saw a woman in half next,' the robot whispered to Mishkin. <br>`For my next illusion,' the magician said, `I will saw a woman in half.' <br>`This ought to be something,' Mishkin said. <br>
`He does it with mirrors,' the robot said. <br> <br>Years afterward, Mishkin remembered the magician's face: a long American face, <br>
putty and rose over hard white bone. His blue eyes were mirrors of the unredeemed <br>
landscape; and when the mirrors became windows, they showed an interior landscape <br>identical to the exterior. It was a face turned hopefully towards dreams but shaped <br>
irrevocably by nightmares. The face was finally more memorable than the deeds that its <br>owner performed. <br>
 <br>The magician reached into his suitcase and took out a black-haired woman with violet <br>
eyes, wearing a Piaget dress and carrying a Vuitton handbag. She winked at Mishkin and <br>
said, `I'll try anything once.' <br>
`She always says that,' the magician said. `She doesn't realize that to try something <br>
once is to try it always.' <br>
 <br>Years later the young woman said to a girlfriend, `I was kinda freaky in those days. <br>
Man, I even let myself be sawed in half by a crazy magician. What do you think about <br>that?' <br>
 <br>The magician took a high-speed portable rotary saw from his suitcase, tried to start it, <br>
couldn't. He took an electric outlet from his suitcase, plugged in the saw, and started it. <br>
 <br>`Was it one of those fakey sideshow numbers?' the friend asked. <br>`Like hell, fake! This magician creep, the Great Dermos or Thermos, or something, was <br>
strictly on a reality trip. He was about as fake as the Mayo Brothers. He never even <br><i>thought </i>of faking anything. That's why I dug him. But he was also a creep.' <br>
From his suitcase the magician removed a four-man team of surgeons and one <br>
anaesthesiologist, all of them scrubbed, gowned, and masked. He then took out trays of <br>surgical instruments, bottles of anaesthetics, and an operating table complete with <br>
overhead lights and drains. <br>
 <br>


<A name=24></a>The dark-haired young lady stretched out on the operating table. She was very lovely <br>
and brave. A moment like that was worth being sawed in half for. <br>
The magician turned on the saw and approached the young lady. <br> <br>At that moment a man stepped out of the suitcase. He was fiftyish, balding, fat, in no <br>
way prepossessing except for his sudden appearance. In a loud, trembling voice he said, <br>
`I speak out against this marriage in the name of humanity and common sense!' <br>
`Not yet!' the magician hissed. <br>
The man apologized and crept back into the suitcase. <br> <br>Orpheus with his lyre made songs; Ronsard with his saw made cuts. Slowly <br>
(sadistically?) he lowered the whirling saw until it was poised just above the bare, brave <br>midriff of the girl who would try anything once. The girl said, `Man, I've really gotten <br>
myself into it this time.' The anaesthesiologist injected Num-Zit into her stomach. The <br>surgeons made squeaky sounds with their rubber gloves. <br>
Cut! The magician lowered his saw and made a tentative cut across the transverse <br>
brisket, gritted his teeth audibly and went to work. <br>
The saw bit deep. Blood spurted like water from a garden hose gone berserk. Gouts of <br>
gore were thrown into the air in steep parabolas of terror. The surgeons moved in <br>quickly, repairing the rent flesh with bought clamps and sponges and sutures. <br>
`It's a pretty good stunt,' said the robot. <br>`I don't think I like it,' Mishkin said. <br>
The saw cut through major veins and arteries. The surgeons, working with the <br>
precision of a really good ballet troop, stitched and patched. The lady said, `Ouch,' and <br>
the anaesthesiologist administered another five ccs of Num-Zit, and a dollop of Payne-<br>Eeze for good measure. <br>
The stomach was cut through and patched with Scotch Brand Body Tape. <br>`Have I time to fuse this disc?' one of the surgeons asked. <br>`Stick to essentials,' said Dr Zorba. <br>
The spine was cut through and repaired with two plastic shirt stays and half a pint of <br>
Elmer's Glue. The magician continued sawing right through the table. The <br>
anaesthesiologist pulled a carpenter from the trunk, who repaired the damage on the <br>spot. The young lady smiled bravely. The magician turned off his saw and bowed to <br>
Mishkin and the robot. <br>
`For my next illusion,' the magician said, `in front of your very eyes, I will...' <br>
He stopped. They all heard the wail of a train whistle. Soon the train itself appeared, <br>
steam-operated, three cars long, laying track as it went. <br>
`Sorry I can't complete the act,' the magician said, stepping aboard the first car. `But <br>
that's how it goes. Something always turns up.' <br>
`Ticket,' said the conductor. <br>
The magician produced a ticket from his hat. Slowly, the train got under way. Ronsard <br>
called out, `How did you like the act?' <br>
`It was great!' Mishkin said. <br>`That was nothing,' said the magician. `Wait until you see the finale.' <br>
`When will that be?' <br>`It is happening now!' <br>`What's happening?' Mishkin called. `Who are you?' <br>
But the train was too far away for him to hear Ronsard's reply if, indeed, he made <br>
any. <br>
Mishkin and the robot watched until the train was out of sight. Then Mishkin said, `I've <br>
got a funny feeling about all this.' <br>
`Mirrors,' the robot sneered. `Big talk and cheap stage effects.' <br>They stood under a sky that reflected the earth that reflected the sky and discussed <br>
mirrors and stage effects. <br><b> <br> </b><br>

<A name=25></a>20. Robot Follies <br>
 <br>The robot had not always been of a suchness. Once he had known the splendour of <br>
youth. He, too, had drifted beneath laurel, under a willow-eyed sky. He, too, had wept at <br>
shadows, fought love, and conquered feeling. A child of Hephaestus, of the earth truly, <br>he was the unwilling respondent of those programmatic outlooks which find identity only <br>
in similarity. <br>
A robot may be defined as the sum of his relationships plus eighty-eight pounds of <br>
metal and plastics. <br>
Robots desire soft things, the better to appreciate their own hardness. Robots of the <br>
Schenectady area worship a being they call White Leather Man. No Freud of the robots <br>
has come forth to explain this output. <br>
When robots come they spurt hot grease, just like automobiles. <br>
Robots mimic eating. There is a black robot who lives on 125th Street and drives a <br>
pink Cadillac. There are Jewish robots skilled in exegesis, whose parts drip chicken fat. <br>
There are homosexual robots wtio dance and lust. <br>
Once upon a time a young robot wandered far from his factory. Lost and alone, he <br>
moved through a deep forest... <br>
How well our robot remembered! A sort of madness came over him. Opacity of desire <br>
seemed a response that one could live by. He saw Mishkin as imperfect yet lovable. This <br>
was programming; he knew he did not know how to escape it. <br><b> <br> <br></b>21. Ancestral Voices Prophesying Predictability Experimental Psychoses Produced by <br>

 <br>`Mishkin! Gome in here! You have nothing to lose but your preconceptions!' <br> <br>`Price of admission--your premise.' <br>
 <br>`Come, Mishkin lad, forget that dreary old business of the missing part. Let go of it and <br>
live a life at this moment.' <br>
 <br>`Hang up your logic over there.' <br> <br>`The only way out of the systems of repetition-compulsion is through novelty. <br>
Singularity instead of regularity. You must never predict your response. You must go <br>through the world as if it were the world.' <br>
 <br>`Mishkin! You must not live as though your life were a preparation for living. <br>
Preparation is an illusion. What you thought you were preparing for is what you are doing <br>right now, which is preparing.' <br>
 <br>`Prince Mishkin, I beg you to wake up and realize who you are.' <br>
 <br>`You search for an object fixed in your memory like a rock in a shallow pond. <br>
Touching, perhaps, but not convincing. Do you think that you still must search? Right <br>
now, you may be solving future searches without even knowing it!' <br>
 <br>`Here, Mishkin, is the egg you will be looking for!' <br> <br>`I lost my beloved's shoe under distressing circumstances. But now Mishkin has found <br>
it.'  <br>
`It's right over here, Mishkin--the. Holy Grail!' <br> <br>`Upon my word! He's found the lost city of Atlantis!' <br> <br>`Shiver me timbers! He's discovered the Lost Dutchman mine!' <br>

<A name=26></a> <br>`Be damned if he hasn't stumbled across the Holy Sepulchre!' <br>
 <br>`This attack upon your purpose is deadly dangerous, but not to be simplemindedly <br>
resisted. Some things that devour us enhance us. Sometimes we must stand still and let <br>ourselves be eaten.' <br>
 <br>`Open the gates! Let Mishkin pass through!' <br>
 <br>`I smell memory leakage. Someone around here is not paying attention.' <br> <br>`Mishkin has found the White Goddess!' <br> <br>`And also the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow; the secret cave where the sirens <br>
dwell; the tomb of Charlemagne; the Hall of Barbarossa; the Sibylline Books; the <br>
Philosopher's Stone--to name but a few.' <br><b> <br> <br></b>22 <br>
 <br>Mishkin lived in a nice little house with a nice little wife, a nice little grape arbour. <br>
Almost everything he had was nice and little. There were exceptions, of course: <br>
specifically, a nice big dog, and a not nice big chair, and a not nice little car. Still, almost <br>everything else was as nice as you could get it and as little as you could hope for. <br>
One day <br> <br>FUTUREFLASH! <br> <br>At first glance he seemed an old man: his white hair, palsied walk, dribbly lower lip, <br>
faded eye, and blotched hand all argued that he was on the wrong side of seventy. What <br>a surprise, then, to discover that his actual chronological age was a mere twenty-three. <br>
`A single event did harrow me thus,' quavered the oldster. <br>`It must have been exceptionally heavy,' Mishkin remarked. <br>
`It will be,' the old man said. `You see, due to a faulty relay in the space-time <br>
continuum, I remembered an event that I will only experience in the future. The verb <br>
tenses get a little tricky, but I'm sure you know what I mean.' <br>
`I think so,' Mishkin said. `But what is or was or will be this experience that you will <br>
have and that has already altered you so drastically?' <br>
`Young man,' said the old man, `I was there when Earth fought its last and greatest <br>
fight against the Black Hell Creatures from Far Arcturus.' <br>
`Tell me about it,' Mishkin said. <br>`I was just about to,' the old man said and made himself as comfortable as he could, <br>
considering the brittleness of his bones. <br><b> <br> <br></b>23. Earth versus the Black Hell Creatures from Far Arcturus <br>
 <br>Captain John McRoy's Superdreadnaught-class XK-12X spaceship, on picket duty out <br>
beyond the Southern Ridge Belt Stars, was the first to pick up the signal that all Terra <br>
was soon to know and to dread. But this was at the beginning, and the first hint of <br>anything wrong came when Radioman 2nd Class Rip Halliday came to the captain's cabin <br>
with a worried look on his homely, freckled face. <br>
`Take a pew, Rip,' the captain boomed. `Drink? Lee Pan Hao, our friendly Cantonese <br>
cook, has brewed up some high-energy cocoa that really does the trick. Or how about <br>some tollhouse cookies made with real Martian chocolate?' <br>
`No, thanks, Captain, nothing right now.' <br>
`Then slouch back in that easy chair and let's hear what's on your mind.' <br>Rip Halliday slouched back but with a hint of respectful attentiveness. In that age, <br>
when a perfect classlessness was observed by all superiors, the utmost informality <br>
 <br>


<A name=27></a>prevailed. The system worked because inferiors never presumed above their station and <br>always maintained a perfect measure of respect. <br>
`Well, sir, I was...' <br>`Please, Rip, no &quot;sirs&quot; in this cabin. Just call me John.' <br>
`Well, sir, John, I was doing a routine sweep of the 6B2 radio bands, but this time I <br>
was using a zero-beat random selector just to see how it worked. If you remember the <br>
Thalberg-Martin equations, sir, they postulate...' <br>
The captain grinned and held up a broad, muscular pink hand. `Radio's <i>your </i>field, Rip. <br>
I'm just an intergalactic truck driver. I've never gotten beyond the sigma series <br>transformations. So put it into plain English--what did you pick up?' <br>
`A signal,' Rip answered promptly. `It came across loud enough to dent my ear before <br>
the AFC cut in.' <br>
The captain nodded. `No cause for alarm, is there? I suppose it was a radio star <br>
effect?' <br>
Halliday shook his head. `None in the vicinity.' <br>
`Deflection reading?' <br>`Not possible, given our present speed and coordinates.' <br>
`No chance it was a mechanically produced static effect--maybe caused by a <br>
concentration of cosmic debris grinding together?' <br>
`No chance, sir. The configuration pattern is completely different. And what's more, <br>
the signal I got was <i>frequency-modulated</i>.' <br>
The captain whistled softly. `No natural discharge could account for that!' <br>
`No, sir, John. Intelligent life produced those patterns.' <br>`Um,' said the captain. <br>
`Any chance it might be a ship of ours broadcasting?' Rip asked hopefully. <br>The captain shook his head. `The nearest Terran patrol ship is clear on the other side <br>
of Fiona II.' <br>
Rip whistled softly. `I was afraid of that!' <br>The captain nodded. `It means that we've just contacted alien intelligent life of a type <br>
completely unknown to us, and we're closing with them fast. <br>
`This is Earth's first contact with alien intelligent life,' the captain said softly to Rip. `I <br>
think you'd better tell Marv Painter that we need a translation of those alien impulses, <br>pronto.' <br>
Rip Halliday's freckles stood out darker against the sudden pallor of his face. `I'm on <br>
my way, John. Sir, I mean.' <br>
The door dilated to allow the red-haired radioman to pass. Alone, the captain sat and <br>
stared at the stereographs of his wife and three sons. He drank a glass of Gatorade in <br>complete silence. Then he pushed the intercom button. <br>
He told the crew that, unless proven otherwise, they would proceed upon the <br>
assumption that they had contacted alien life of unknown intentions. But he did not tell <br>
them about the Rand-Orey equations that predicted an unfriendly first contact at 98.7 <br>per cent probable. His orders were not to disclose this until intention had been indicated <br>
clearly. Anticipation of disaster would have impaired the efficiency of the smoothly <br>functioning machine that was the crew. <br>
Engineer Duff McDermott paced stumpily along the lower catwalk, then stopped to <br>
inspect the drive gauges for the twentieth time in an hour. The needles hung placidly in <br>the green, as McDermott knew they would. But he couldn't stop himself from looking at <br>
them since he knew that contact moment was only 2.0045 hours away. <br>
`Waddya think they'll look like?' asked Andy Tompkins, second assistant engineer's <br>
mate, his prominent adam's apple bouncing below his good-humoured, absentminded <br>face. <br>
`Like something out of hell,' McDermott replied. He was to remember that answer later <br>
and to wonder if there wasn't something to the discredited notion of stress-induced <br>
prescience. <br>
 <br>`Marv,' the captain asked, `how is it going?' <br>
`Pretty good,' said Marv Painter, the shy, skinny, red-haired cybernetic genius. `We <br>
should have an intelligible readout as soon as I splice in this zero-null regenerative <br>
 <br>


<A name=28></a>impulse rejector into the image repro circuit and cross-tie the translator bank into the <br>computer's second-stage input bank.' <br>
`You mean we'll be able to understand them?' Captain McRoy asked. <br>`Shucks, yes. It won't be an exact translation because we don't have a vocab match <br>
up. But if we set the computer to sound-match in terms of probabilities of meaning and <br>maintain a constant feedback loop to further refine hierarchic distinctions then we ought <br>
to get an accurate analogic reading. But that's just my own haywire idea on it, sir. If you <br>would care to try another approach...' <br>
`Marv,' said McRoy, `the primary law of interplanetary cooperation is, let those who <br>
can, do, and let those who can't sit in the parlour with their fingers up their noses and <br>their mouths shut and drink their coffee. I'm just a spaceship driver and you're the <br>
cyberneticist around here, and what you say goes as long as you're speaking in terms of <br>your admittedly limited speciality.' <br>
`Thanks for the vote of confidence, Cap,' said Marv, flashing a smile. `If they worked <br>
governments on Earth like you run a ship it'd be clear sailing for the human race.' <br>
`None of that, now,' the captain said with gruff, old-fashioned modesty. `I just follow <br>
the rules, use plain common sense, temper justice with mercy, and treat every person as <br>
an entire world-system and end unto himself despite social differences imposed by a <br>functional ranking system. Is that rig of yours working yet?' <br>
Marv Painter turned on the set. The video repeater came to life, revealing the interior <br>
of an alien spaceship. Within, a creature sat at the controls. He was bipedal; but any <br>resemblance to humanity began and ended there. The creature was jet green, about <br>
eight feet tall, and massively constructed. He appeared to have a chitinous exoskeleton. <br>Antennae grew from his forehead, and his eyes extended on stalks. He had a large loose <br>
mouth behind which could be seen double rows of pointed white teeth, as on a shark. <br>
The alien spoke: `Much greetings, inferior, wormlike, barely sentient life forms. I am <br>
Thanatos Superbum, Captain-General of the Malachite Brood, Lord of the Vulture <br>Redoubt, Duke Extraordinary to the O'Neills, and various other titles both hereditary and <br>conferred. Down upon your knees, baseborn scum, and make nice to your mental, moral, <br>
and physical superior. Give your name, rank, and serial number and explain in twenty <br>words or less why I should not grind your puny bones into pulp. Over.' <br>
`He talks funny,' said Engineer McDermott. <br>`Funny and mean,' said the captain, frowning purposively. `And also weird.' <br>
`A lot of that,' said Marv, `is because the computer has to analogize the alien's speech <br>
into the nearest Terran idioms, selecting from expressions it has at its disposal in its <br>
memory banks. So, of course, it comes out sounding kinda weird.' <br>
`But are the emotional and informational connotations approximately correct?' the <br>
captain asked. <br>
`I'm afraid so,' Marv said unhappily. <br>`Then it looks like we got a problem on our hands. My first impression is that this alien <br>
is unfriendly.' <br>
`That's my impression, too,' Marv said unhappily. `Sir, I think he's waiting for an <br>
answer.' <br>
`I'll give him one,' the captain said, and turned on the microphone. Angry words boiled <br>
up in his mind like gas expanding according to Boyle's Law. But he forced himself to <br>activate the Martins-Turner Interpersonal Equations, which were part of the hypno-<br>training of every human beyond Intelligence Level IV. Instantly, the captain was icy calm <br>
and capable of objective judgment. He thought, `<i>I have heard words which may or may <br>not represent an objective reality. In any event I will not respond emotionally but will try </i><br>
<i>(a) to deal objectively with the situation and (b) to manipulate it (if possible) to the <br>needs of Earth and mankind.</i>' <br>
Thank God for Korzybski! the captain thought. He said into the microphone, <br>
`Greetings, Thanatos Superbum. I am in command of this ship. My name is McRoy. I am <br>
friendly  and  peaceable,  as  are  all  of  my  race.  I  want  to  make  nice  with  you,  and  I <br>sincerely hope that you want to make nice with me.' <br>
`Blood, sweat, and sneers!' exclaimed Superbum. `I smell the blood of an Americun! To <br>
hell with making nice--not peace but a sword! Let one claw scratch the other. L'audace, <br>toujours 1'audace. If at first they don't succumb, trumb, trumb agun.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=29></a>`Even allowing for anachronism-generating analogies,'  the captain said, `this fellow <br>
sounds mean, hysterical, and full of trouble.' The captain turned on the microphone and <br>
asked Superbum if things couldn't be settled peacefully. <br>
`Peace is for Commie fags,' sneered the alien. `But I will make an offer. You may <br>
choose to be annihilated at once by the inconceivable force of our deadly ray guns, after <br>which our space fleet will destroy your space fleet, after which we will conquer Earth and <br>
implant special radio circuits in the brains of all humans thus rendering them our slaves <br>and subject to various fates worse than death; or you can choose the other alternative.' <br>
`Which is?' <br>`Just about the same thing, only we will be nicer about it if you don't resist.' <br>`Both choices are unacceptable,' Captain McRoy said grimly. <br>
`Then I can only say, watch yourself, break clean in the clinches, and may the best <br>
sentient creature win, and guard yourself at all times, stranger, `cause me and the boys <br>
aim to purely kick the shit out of yore bunch and we ain't pertekeler about how we go <br>about it.' <br>
The captain signed off and grimly ordered his men to action stations. He mentally <br>
adjusted his skin temperature and adrenalin rate, for he had a feeling that this was going <br>
to be a time of hard testing. <br><b> <br> <br></b>24. Another Level Heard From <br>
 <br>In a place whose location cannot be expressed in space-time equivalencies three <br>
beings met. For the purpose of the meeting, they had taken on terraform appearance, <br>
though this was not `normal' for any of them. The leader, acknowledged by ethical <br>development, called himself Ka for purposes of reference. A faint nimbus glowed around <br>
his heroic body and magnificently sculptured head. <br>
`There is no need to explain anything,' Ka said. `All of us gathered here know that the <br>
spacefleets of Earth and Superbum have been destined to clash according to the <br>
immutable laws of dualism. We also know that Earth represents a lot of good things that <br>we approve of, whereas Superbum is an incarnate process of evil and a really bad thing. <br>
I think that it is superfluous to mention that it is vital for our own interests that Earth <br>wins this battle. We are also aware that, as matters stand at present and without our <br>
intervention, Earth stands very little chance indeed. Are we all agreed that we need not <br>discuss these matters?' <br>
The other two beings signified their assent. One of them, De-Ao, said, `I also agree <br>
that we need not discuss what is obvious to us. Therefore, the only question that remains <br>is what form our intervention should take and at what moment it should occur,' <br>
The third being, Maening, said, `My analysis agrees with the previously stated <br>
analyses. There remains only the question of what we should do, and when, which I need <br>
not state since it has been both inferred and stated.' <br>
`I am afraid,' said Ka, `that we must not permit ourselves to assist Earth in any way.' <br>
The two looked at him in consternation. <br>`Earth must stand on its own,' said Ka, `for reasons which become apparent to you if <br>
you take a moment to do some tenth level Fournean rationalizing.' <br>
The others did so and came up with an answer identical to Ka's. <br>`It is a heavy result,' said Maening. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>25. The Emergency Supply Service <br>
 <br>`We supply what you need when you need it,' Mr Monitor said. <br>`That is exactly the kind of service I need,' said Mishkin. <br>
`Of course you do. Everybody does. In today's world of increasing complications it's <br>
really too much to expect people to solve their own problems. They wouldn't have time <br>left to do anything else. People should do their thing. Our thing is supplying what is <br>
needed to solve other people's problems. Your thing is presumably something else. We <br>do our thing and you are able to do your thing. That leaves everybody happy.' <br>
`It sounds too good to be true,' Mishkin said. <br>
 <br>


<A name=30></a>`It is,' Mr Monitor said. <br>`The thing I need,' Mishkin said, `is a spare engine part, number L-1223A.' <br>
`To hear is to obey. Are you prepared to pay for this thing?' <br>`Charge it to my account.' <br>
`You are a customer after my own heart. One spare engine part number L-1223A, <br>
coming up.' <br>
Mr Monitor showed Mishkin his write-ups in <i>The New York Times, New York Magazine, </i><br>
and the <i>Village Voice. </i>All of them were raves. What better recommendations could <br>
anyone ask? Mr Monitor departed. <br>
Mishkin sat down on a stump and waited. After a few hours he heard the noise of a <br>
motorcycle. He saw a man in a fringed leather jacket and a chamois beanie come riding <br>
through the forest. Strapped to the back of the motorcycle was a large parcel. <br>
Fifty yards from Mishkin the motorcyclist ran across a land mine. The man, the cycle, <br>
and the package were blown to bits. <br>
`Easy come, easy go,' Mishkin said. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>26 <br>
 <br>Mishkin was clowning along through the forest, digging the sights and smells and <br>
sounds, feeling the air, really making it big in a spiritual way. He had a song without <br>words on his lips, and his fingers snapped in time to inconceivable rhythms. It was in this <br>
mood that he came across a man leaning against a tree. <br>
The man's eyes were closed. He didn't seem to be breathing, but he didn't seem to be <br>
dead, either. His chest was bare and there was a small bronze plaque on it. The plaque <br>read, TURN ME ON. Above it was a toggle switch. <br>
Mishkin turned the switch. <br>The man's eyes opened immediately. He clutched his forehead and swayed out of <br>
control and would have fallen if Mishkin had not caught him and lowered him gently to <br>
the ground. <br>
`Thank you, dear sir,' the man said. `My name is perhaps Alex Gonkin and I am much <br>
obliged to you; though perhaps it would have been better if you had left me turned off, <br>for now, with my consciousness returned, my fear threatens to overthrow the precarious <br>
sanity of my mind.' <br>
`What seems to be the trouble?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`I heard the voice that said, &quot;In order to kill him, we must kill all of his hims.&quot; I saw at <br>
once that the secret of survival was to conceal the fact that one's self was many. This <br>could be called the first line of defence. The second line of defence was the presence of <br>
the selves and their intercommunication. I knew at once that my selves had to be killed <br>simultaneously, or as near to simultaneity as possible, to prevent my selves from <br>
learning what was happening and taking appropriate defensive action. Do you follow <br>me?' <br>
`I think so,' Mishkin said. <br>`Then you're crazy, and I stand mute. Now we will have a few words from my <br>
Accusator.' <br>
The Accusator lowered himself from a tree and stood before Mishkin reproachfully <br>

`Thou shalt not turn on what has been turned off,' said the Accusator. <br>`Listen,' Mishkin said, `if God hadn't meant this man to be turned on He wouldn't have <br>
put a toggle switch on his chest.' <br>
`True... But in His ineffable wisdom God caused the toggle switch to be capable of <br>
being turned off.' <br>
`But God also put a plaque on his chest which read TURN ME ON.' <br>
`Exegesis is a dangerous conceit,' said the Accusator. <br>`I didn't mean to indulge in it,' Mishkin said. `But the moral is clear enough to mer: <br>
namely that people with toggle switches in their chests shouldn't dump on you.' <br>
`What was that?' the Accusator shouted. `What did you say? Are you absolutely out of <br>
your mind?' <br>
`What did I say?' Mishkin asked. `What happened? Where am I?' <br>
 <br>


<A name=31></a>`Your actions will be studied,' said the Accusator, `and we will let you know the results <br>
of our deliberations.' <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>27. In the Hall of Distorting Mirrors <br>
 <br>Automatism can be induced in people. Indeed, you might say that automatism <i>is </i><br>
people. We are under the control of our emotions. We float here and there on currents of <br>
what we want and what we don't want, what we desire and what desires us. <br>
Still, take an object, any object. An orange. But the mind rejects an orange, it is round <br>
and orange--paradoxically square. Let's take something else. But now we are stuck with <br>
the orange. Thick, pockmarked skin. Any number of associations to orange, most of them <br>banal. Orange must be struck from the list of permissible objects to associate to. <br>
No  more  truck  with  oranges,  and  no  more trucking of oranges. Oranges occupy <br>
entirely too prominent a place. Take an orange. We've taken enough oranges. The <br>
orange is a placebo of the mind. Why not take an intestine? Easily visualized, capable of <br>producing many novel trips. But intestines are tediously labyrinthine. Intestines go round <br>
and round and come out orange. Intestines are filled with unpleasant matter. Perhaps it's <br>best to go back to oranges. <br>
Take an orange. Take it quickly before it takes you. The world of the orange is perhaps <br>
not entirely incomprehensible. <br>
Take the subject of Mishkin and oranges. For many years Mishkin had not thought <br>
much of oranges. <i>Apparently.  </i>But in truth we know that a thing's absence implies its <br>presence. Thus, we infer the presence of oranges in Mishkin's mind, and from that we <br>
can begin to deduce many other relationships. <br>
One thing is certain: Mishkin never knew consciously about his negative infatuation <br>
with oranges. Mishkin and the anti-orange. Oranges and the anti-Mishkin. <br>
We must not, however, make the error of  positing  simple  opposition. Mishkin's <br>
overdetermined disregard for oranges might not imply an opposite. More likely the figure <br>
of speech we are looking for is the oxymoron: the mating of opposites. Incongruities are <br>not reciprocal. Reciprocity is lost in the oxymoron. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>28 <br>
 <br>`The beast that kills by boredom,' said the robot, `is also found in these parts. His <br>
voice is firm and authoritative. His statements are unchallengeable and unbelievable. His <br>appearance is unimpeachable and obnoxious. You meet him and wish him dead, although <br>
he had done nothing wrong, absolutely nothing. He speaks to you about this in a <br>reasonable manner. The tension becomes unbearable. Your inability to act induces <br>
apathy, which is heightened by the extreme monotony of your situation. Since you <br>cannot kill him, you kill yourself.' <br>
`Where is he now?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Boring fish for his dinner. He does this by lecturing to them on their inalienable <br>
rights.' <br>
`I beg your pardon,' a fish said. `No fish has ever been bored to death.' <br>`Go get stuffed,' the robot snarled. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>29. Confusion Termed Key to Understanding <br>
 <br>Upon a flat white rock Mishkin saw a white princess telephone. As he came up to it the <br>
telephone began ringing. <br>
Mishkin picked it up and said, `Hello.' <br>`Tom? Tom Mishkin? Is that you?' <br>`It is,' Mishkin said. `Who is this?' <br>
`This is your uncle, Arnold Epstein. Tom, how is everything?' <br>`Not bad,' Mishkin said. `I've got a few problems...' <br>
`Who hasn't? But your health, is it good?' <br>
 <br>


<A name=32></a>`Fine, Uncle Arnold. And yours?' <br>`Not bad, considering. Tom, it's good to hear your voice.' <br>
`Uncle Arnold, how did you happen to call me here?' <br>`It was a free gift from the A &amp; P. I was the millionth customer for the morning and <br>
they awarded me a basket of groceries and one telephone call to anyone I wanted to call <br>anywhere.' <br>
`Well, it's nice that you called me, I appreciate it.' <br>`It's  been  a  pleasure  for  me  to  hear  your voice. Listen, Tom, your parents, are they <br>
well?' <br>
`Fine,' Mishkin said. <br>`And your sister?' <br>
`She's fine. She's in Europe.' <br>`That's nice. And where are you, I didn't quite understand the operator.' <br>
`I'm on a planet called Harmonia.' <br>`Is it a nice place?' <br>
`I suppose so.' <br>`Well, have a nice vacation. Tom, is there anything I can do for you?' <br>
`As a matter of fact, there is,' Mishkin said. `Have you got a pencil and a piece of <br>
paper?' <br>
`You know me, Tom, I'm never without them.' <br>
`Then write down Engine Part L-1223A. I need it very badly.' <br>`I got it written down. Don't they have a Sears, Roebuck where you are?' <br>
`No, Uncle Arnold, they haven't got anything like that. Harmonia is a sort of <br>
undeveloped place.' <br>
`Like Tobago?' <br>`Even worse. Uncle Arnold, I need that engine part right now, by the fastest shipping <br>
service available.' <br>
`Tom, it's as good as done. You remember Seymour Gulstein, the son of your Aunt <br>
Rachel's best friend, Gertie? Well, Seymour is a field expeditor for F. B. Crowley <br>
Interplanetary Delivery Systems. I'll get the engine part this afternoon and put it in his <br>hands and he'll get it to you in a couple of hours, a day at the most.' <br>
`That's great, Uncle Arnold. Will it really be that fast?' <br>`You can count on it, Tom. When has your Uncle Arnold ever failed you?' <br>
`I don't know how to thank you, Uncle Arnold.' <br>`Think nothing of it, Tom. Stay well. Give me a call when you get home.' <br>
Mishkin hung up, leaned back, and relaxed. If his Uncle Arnold said it would be done. <br>
Governments might promise more than they could deliver, scientists might be <br>overoptimistic about what they could accomplish, robots might have exaggerated ideas <br>
of their power; but Uncle Arnold actually made the world run while everyone else stood <br>around trying to get it together. Uncle Arnold was maybe a little dull but absolutely <br>
irreplaceable. The turtle upon whose back Hercules stood when he held the Earth on his <br>shoulders--that turtle was also called Arnold. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>30 <br>
 <br>Mishkin and the robot came to a tree. At the end of its branches there were blue eyes <br>
with thick eyebrows. All of the eyes swivelled to stare at Mishkin. <br>
`I <i>thought </i>you would come by this way,' the tree said, speaking from a speaker in its <br>
trunk. `I hope that you will not deny that you are Thomas Mishkin?' <br>
`That's who I am,' Mishkin said. `Who are you?' <br>
`I am a bill collector disguised as a tree,' said the bill collector disguised as a tree. <br>`For Chrissakes,' Mishkin said. `Did you follow me all the way to Harmonia?' <br>
`Indeed, I did. It's rather a curious story. Mr Oppenheimer, head of the Ne Plus Ultra <br>
Collection Agency for which I work, got an inspiration while stoned on acid at his local Tai <br>Chi Chuan class. It suddenly occurred to Oppenheimer that the essence of life lies in <br>
completions, and a man can only judge his life in reference to the thoroughness with <br>which he has played his life role. Hitherto, Oppenheimer had been an easygoing fellow <br>
who followed the usual practice of collecting the easily collectable debts and making a <br>
 <br>


<A name=33></a>few ominous noises on the difficult ones, but ultimately saying to hell with them. Then <br>Oppenheimer achieved his satori. To hell with mediocrity, he decided,  if  I'm  head  of  a <br>
bill-collecting agency, then I'm going to make an ethic and a goal out of bill collecting. <br>The world may very well never understand me; but perhaps future generations will be <br>
able to judge the terrible purity of my motives. <br>
`And so Oppenheimer embarked upon the poignant and quixotic course that will <br>
probably bankrupt him within a year. He called all of us collectors into the Ready Room. <br>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;this time we're going to get it all together. To hell with half <br>
measures! Our goal now is 100 per cent enforceability, and let the paranoia fall where it <br>may. Go after those debts be they one dollar or a million. Go to San Sebastian or Samoa <br>or Sambal V, if need be, and don't worry about the costs. We're following a principle <br>
now, and principles are always impractical. Boys, we're overthrowing the reality principle. <br>So get out there and collect all of those debts and groove on completions.&quot; ` <br>
 <br>`His speech is definitely late 1960s,' said the robot. `Whereas this is the year 2138, or <br>
thereabouts. Somebody is conning somebody.' <br>
`Fuck off,' snarled the author. <br>
 <br>`That was the call to arms,' the bill collector disguised as a tree said. `And that is why I <br>
am in Harmonia, Mr Mishkin. I have come here, as the result of one man's vision, to <br>
collect your debts regardless of time, trouble, and expense.' <br>
`I still can't believe this,' Mishkin said. <br>
`And, yet, there it is. I have a consolidation statement here for everything, Mr Mishkin. <br>
Would you care to pay without fuss, or do you want me to get nasty?' <br>
`What debts are you talking about?' Mishkin asked. <br>`To begin with, there is the matter of your back taxes, Federal, State, and City. Didn't <br>
quite get around to paying them last year, did you, Mr Mishkin?' <br>
`It was a tough year.' <br>`You owe eight thousand seven hundred and fifty-three dollars and fifty-one cents to <br>
your Uncle Sammy. Then there is the matter of child support. Sorta passed up on that for <br>a year or so, didn't you, Mishkin? Well, it's a neat four-figure bundle that you owe to <br>
poor, abandoned Marcia and little Zelda. Marcia has a new boyfriend, by the way, and <br>little Zelda just flunked out of the Little Red School House. Marcia asked me to tell you <br>
that she is well, having the best time of her life, and wants every cent you owe her, right <br>now, or she'll have you into The Tombs so fast it'll make your teeth spin. She adds that, <br>
through psychoanalysis, she finally has the ego strength to tell you that you were always <br>a lousy lay and that everybody breaks up when she relates how diffidently you tried to <br>pursue perversions.' <br>
`That sounds like Marcia,' Mishkin said. <br>`Next, you owe Marty Bargenfield a thousand dollars. He's your best friend, in case <br>
you don't remember. Or he was. I mean, <i>he  </i>still feels the same, but you've <br>unaccountably cooled off. One might even say that you are avoiding him. Yet, his only <br>
crime was to loan you money in a moment of need when you were breaking up with <br>Marcia and had to buy an abortion for Monique.' <br>
`How is Monique?' Mishkin asked. <br>`She's doing very nicely without you. She is back in Paris, working as a salesgirl in <br>
Galeries Lafayette. She still treasures the eighty-cent string of wooden beads that was <br>
your only present to her during a tumultuous four-month romance that you have <br>described as &quot;the most moving of my life&quot;.' <br>
`I was broke,' Mishkin said. `And, anyhow, she always said she hated gifts.' <br>`But you knew better, hey, Mishkie? Never mind, I am not standing in judgement over <br>
you. The fact that your conduct, judged by any system of ethics you care to name, <br>makes me want to puke is entirely a personal matter with me and need not concern you <br>
at all. Now we come to the Bauhaus Drugstore, at 31 Barrow Street, run by fat, friendly <br>Charlie Ducks, who sold you Dexamyl spansules, Dexadrine tablets, Librium, Carbitol, <br>Nembutal, Seconal, Doriden, and so on, in astonishing quantities during your drug years, <br>
all of them on the basis of one non-refillable prescription for phenobarbital--who <br>continued to do so until two years ago when the heat got too hot and he went back to <br>
 <br>


<A name=34></a>selling Excedrin and lipsticks, and whom you ripped off for one hundred and eighty-six <br>dollars.' <br>
`He cleaned up on me,' Mishkin said. `He charged me double for everything.' <br>`You always knew that. Did you ever complain about it?' <br>
`Anyhow, I'm going to pay him as soon as I have some money.' <br>`But there's never enough money for last year's drugs, eh, Mish? We've all been down <br>
that road, baby; but it <i>is </i>loathsome, isn't it?' <br>
`I can explain everything,' Mishkin said. `I have a statement that I would like to read <br>
into the record. The facts are capable of various interpretations. I only need a moment to <br>pull my self together.' <br>
The robot extruded an axe from his left hand. He stepped forward and briskly chopped <br>
down the bill collector, who perished miserably. <br>
`But I was just about to explain,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Never explain anything,' the robot told him. `Avoid bummers. Don't go on other <br>
people's trips.' <br>
`What is my trip?' Mishkin asked. <br>`That would be telling,' said the robot. <br>

 <br>`Don't take any more of that dream medicine,' the Life Systems Total Support <br>
Mechanism told Mishkin. `Use me, instead. I am good, useful, beautiful, docile. And you <br>
never have to worry about my breaking down and ceasing to function.' <br>
`Do you mean that you never break down?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`That would be an impossible claim. All created things are subject to damage and <br>
disrepair. Nothing is immune from breakdown. The important question to be asked is, <br>
how are the breakdowns handled?' <br>
`Well, how are they handled?' Mishkin asked. <br>`In my case,' the LSTSM said, `I possess a set of interlocking infinite-backup repair <br>
systems. If I suffer damage I immediately repair myself, utilizing the most appropriate <br>system. If the appropriate system itself is damaged I automatically shift over to another <br>
system.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=35></a>`Your number of repair systems is finite, though, isn't it?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Of course. But the possible combinations and recombinations of my systems and <br>
subsystems is large enough to justify the word `infinite'. <br>
`Amazing,' Mishkin said. <br>
`Yes, I am an uncanny bit of machinery and quite perfect for your needs. I can take <br>
care of myself. All I desire is to serve.' <br>
`What is it exactly that you do?' <br>`I can fry eggs, wash clothes, accompany myself on the banjo--to name but a few of <br>
my talents.' <br>
`Everything about you sounds marvellous,' Mishkin said. `I'll think about it. But now I <br>
have to point out that your right front tyre is flat.' <br>
`Damn,' said the LSTSM. `How embarrassing.' <br>`But I suppose you can fix it with your infinite-backup repair systems?' <br>
`I'm afraid not,' said the LSTSM. `It's an unaccountable lapse on the part of my <br>
designers. Damn! Back to the old drawing board.' <br>
`I'm sorry,' said Mishkin. <br>`I am, too,' said the LSTSM. `We could have been quite perfect for each other if you <br>
hadn't been so absurdly choosy.' <br>
The LSTSM turned without another word and limped away through the forest, looking <br>
frail, pathetic, and a little funny. Just then three leaves fell from a nearby tree. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>33. Spread and Proliferation of Subassemblies <br>
 <br>Orchidius had observed everything. Mishkin asked him what he thought about it all. <br>`There's only one part I didn't understand,' said Orchidius. <br>
`What part was that?' <br>`That was when the three leaves fell. Why did they do that just at that particular <br>
moment?' <br>
`Coincidence,' suggested Mishkin. <br>`I have heard machines speak and animals answer,' said Orchidius. `People come and <br>
go mysteriously, yet with definite signs of hidden purpose. There is a meaning in <br>everything. But three leaves falling, just then, just there! Who ever heard of such a <br>
thing?' <br>
`Personally, I'm more interested in marvels,' Mishkin said. <br>
`I am, too,' said Orchidius. `We simply disagree on what a marvel is.' <br>`What are you looking for?' Mishkin asked. <br>`I really don't know,' Orchidius said. `But I expect to know intuitively when I find it. <br>
What are you looking for?' <br>
`I can't remember,' Mishkin said. `But I think I'll know it when I see it.' <br>
`Perhaps it's best not to know,' Orchidius said. `Knowing what you're looking for <br>
interferes with your looking for it.' <br>
`I don't think that can be so,' Mishkin said. <br>`Do you think it's a delusion?' Orchidius asked eagerly. `I've always wanted to have a <br>
genuine delusion.' <br>
The robot was unable to keep silent any longer. `I've never heard such frivolity in my <br>
life.' <br>
`I suppose that frivolity is also a permissible path to salvation?' Orchidius said mildly. <br>
`Whether it is or not, it is the path I'm on. And now my search leads me elsewhere. Good <br>
day, gentlemen.' <br>
At the edge of the forest Mishkin and the robot came to a hut with a crude sign over <br>
the door reading, INN OF THE FOUR WINDS. And there to greet them, wearing a shirt of <br>homespun and leather bells, was Orchidius. <br>
Mishkin expressed amazement at seeing his friend in this place, the evident owner of <br>
an inn; but Orchidius told him that it was the most natural thing in the world. He told <br>how he had come to this place, tired and thirsty, but above all hungry. He had gathered <br>
herbs and vegetables and made a soup, and then he trapped a rabbit and made a stew. <br>
People came by, tired and thirsty, but above all hungry. Orchidius shared his stew <br>
with them, and they helped him to build a hut. Others came by and Orchidius fed them, <br>
 <br>


<A name=36></a>and sometimes they would not, or could not, pay, but usually they could and would, in <br>one way or another. It seemed quite natural to them that there should be an inn here, at <br>
this place and no other, and that Orchidius should be running it. It never occurred to <br>them that Orchidius was just passing through, like them, and that perhaps he, too, had <br>
other places to go to and other duties to attend to. They thought that he was a natural <br>and necessary part of the scenery, since they believed that inns should be found <br>
wherever people needed them and that, according to universal law, every inn had to be <br>equipped with an innkeeper. <br>
After a while Orchidius came to accept this view. He advertised for a chambermaid. He <br>
complained that the quality of rabbits had fallen off. He suspected everyone of being an <br>inspector from the <i>Guide Michelin. </i>He planned to expand his inn, to buy a soft ice-cream <br>
maker, to get a franchise from Howard Johnson's, to plant palm trees and illuminate <br>them with hidden lights. He began to worry about fuel bills and taxes. He raised his <br>
prices for high season and offered specials for low season. <br>
`But how did you get into all of that?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`It seemed plausible at the time,' Orchidius answered. `It still seems plausible.' <br>`I want a single room with a bath,' Mishkin said. `And a tank of gas for my robot.' <br>
`Regular or special?' Orchidius asked. Then he burst into tears. He wrote a note that <br>
read, `This inn is closed while its owner continues his Trip.' He nailed the note to the door <br>and left at once for parts unknown, taking nothing with him but a battery-operated <br>
television set and a pair of gold clubs. <br><b> <br> <br></b>34  <br>
Mishkin and the robot also resumed their journey. They passed a tree upon which <br>
were carved the words, `Orchidius was here in person on his Trip'. <br>
Carved on another tree: `This Trip is the property of Orchidius'. <br>And on another: `Everybody is a bit player in the movie of Orchidius's life'. <br>
 <br>
`We seem to meet quite often,' Mishkin said. `Do you suppose that we are the same <br>
person?' <br>
`Definitely not,' said Orchidius. `You are logical and realistic and goal-oriented, and you <br>
have a personality and a history and even a few character traits, whereas I am an <br>abstraction who just slips in and out of things for no reason and no purpose.' <br>
`My trip is overdetermined,' Mishkin said. `It's also freaky. Too much is happening to <br>
me. I can't stand the changes.' <br>
`I can't stand them, either. Maybe we're going about things in the wrong way.' <br>
The robot said, `You are both going about things in the right way and you're both <br>
simultaneously the same person and different people and you're both on the same trip <br>
even though your trips aren't the same.' <br>
`Can you explain what all of that means?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`No, I can't,' the robot said. `Robots are allowed only a small supply of wisdom, and I <br>
have used up all of mine for at least a week.' <br>
All that week the robot could barely put one foot after another. He was incapable of <br>
oiling himself, couldn't finish the simplest task, and his answers to even the simplest <br>questions were ridiculous in the extreme. <br>
At the end of the week he was recovered and ready to explain what all of that had <br>
meant. But Mishkin didn't ask him. Mishkin liked to have his meals cooked properly and <br>
his clothes washed promptly. He thought it was no bargain to exchange a good servant <br>for a sage of dubious qualifications. The robot himself offered no protest. <br>

Orchidius was at the Festival of the Mind. He wore a headband, robe, and sandals, and <br>
employed hieratic gestures of great power and economy. He had his own booth and for <br>two days gave prophecies with fair success but on the third day reverted to a previous <br>
imprinting and turned his booth into a hot dog stand. <br>
 <br>Mishkin wandered through the Festival and ate cotton candy and thought bittersweet <br>
thoughts of his youth, just like everyone else. He smiled politely and disdainfully, just like <br>
everybody else. But this was no real indication of his true attitude. Mishkin was a secret <br>pilgrim. He wanted out of his bag, out of repetition-compulsion, out of confusion, out of <br>tedious novelty. Just like everybody else. <br>

 <br>Mishkin clung to the outer edges of the face, which began to melt, the nose flattening <br>
and segueing into the cheek, the eyes bleeding into the hair, the mouth softening and <br>
blurring, the handholds pulling out of the silly putty, and Mishkin slid away through <br>obligatory swallow song, and long, still Ohio nights with the crickets raucous in the box-<br>
berry hedges, and the telephone lines black against the sky like a diagram of your whole <br>life. <br>
It was like that, but it wasn't exactly like that. It was more like those hushed summer <br>
nights in the old frame house in Rushmore, Mississippi, when an intolerable sweetness <br>clung to the moist denim stretched over a young girl's sleeping buttocks, and you <br>
realized, young though you were, that things were going to happen to you, and you <br>would live by them and lose by them, but always, somewhere, the river would wind, dark <br>
and sinuous, sweet mother of the past, companion of the present, mourner of the <br>irretrievable future. <br>

 <br>A slingshot. With this weapon Mishkin shot his way through innumerable fantasies. <br>
Later, he exchanged his slingshot for an M-1 and shot his way through the same <br>fantasies. <br>
 <br>An empty butter wrapper. Mishkin once ate an  entire  pound  of  butter at a single <br>
sitting, washing it down with a quart of ice-cold milk. Now he lives away from home and <br>picks at his food like a bird. <br>
 <br>An Indian war club. Mishkin made this at camp. He also made Mary Lou Watkins at the <br>
same camp but not all the way. Later on Mishkin made a lot of people all the way. Now <br>
he travels. <br>
 <br>A page of sheet mustic entitled `Old Black Joe'. Mishkin didn't think about Negroes <br>
when he was a boy. Now, a man, he doesn't think about blacks. But he talks about them <br>
and dreams about them. <br>

<A name=39></a>A Sanskrit grammar. Mishkin once planned to learn Sanskrit in order to read <i>The </i><br>
<i>Upanishads </i>in the original. Now he doesn't even read them in English. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>41 <br>
 <br>Mishkin ascended to heaven on a fiery chariot and there he met the Lord God of <br>
Hosts, and Mishkin prostrated himself before the Deity and said, `Lord, Lord, I have <br>
sinned,' which seemed a pretty good thing to say under the circumstances. <br>
But God smiled and raised Mishkin up and said, `Rather, Mishkin, say that I have <br>
sinned; for what are your sins but the deficiencies that I caused to be put into you in <br>
order to test you and give you grievous trials and a dark night of the soul, the point <br>being that you should overcome them. This may seem a kind of weird way of operating, <br>
but it is unreservedly recommended on page 102 of the best seller, <i>This Business of <br>Being God, </i>written by a symposium of Parisian intellectuals and American hippies, and <br>
published by the Godhead Institution with offices in New York, London, Paris, Ibiza, and <br>Katmandu, and with a foreword by Yours Truly.' <br>
`I have failed the crucial tests,' Mishkin said. `I am mean, nasty, greedy, selfish, and <br>
uncaring.' <br>
`Don't get into a masochism number,' said God. `Just as there is love which surpasseth <br>
understanding, so there is understanding which surpasseth love. For have I not written, <br>the last shall be the first?' <br>
`You are kind,' Mishkin said. `But I don't really understand.' <br>`Understanding is a down,' God said. `Be comforted, Mishkin, for your vibrations are <br>
OK, and I think right now I need a vacation.' <br><b> <br> <br></b>42 <br>
 <br>`I think,' Mishkin said, `that it is time for a bit of static description. And then a bit of <br>
action.' The space fleet came thundering in on fiery jets. Somewhere, a tree was crying. <br>
Mishkin's father said, `Maybe I don't know what I like, but I sure as shooting know what I <br>don't like.' The people next door were a mystery, according to Angela. `Take nothing into <br>
account.' `But what do you mean, a mystery?' Claire couldn't explain, but she felt it was <br>time for a bit of static description, and then a bit of action. `It doesn't really <i>work </i>that <br>
way.' Mishkin knew that it was true and untrue, and he loved her and hated her for it. It <br>was a complicated world, but so what? <br>
Mishkin liked a bit of complication: `Excuse me, Captain, the pusher beam trigger <br>
mechanism seems to have broken down.' But not too much. He liked story lines that you <br>could follow while thinking of other things. `Spare me that avant-garde stuff,' Alice said, <br>
`besides, it's not your thing.' Not my thing? Then why bother building palaces out of <br>frying pans, why look for a jewel on the forehead of a toad? Subjects and verbs must <br>
agree, everyone agreed, but not on anything else. <br>
Mishkin wondered what a spaceship looked like. What could you compare a spaceship <br>
to? Itself? `The spaceship looked utterly like itself.' Jane shook her head. Mishkin's father <br>shook his head. Mishkin tried to play the flute. His skin itched. He wished he could think <br>of something a spaceship looked like. Not itself. He decided to buy a toy spaceship and <br>
describe that. <br><b> <br> <br></b>43. Specialist Lists Eye Osmosis as Primary Cause of Possession <br>

<A name=40></a>44. Doctor Mishkin Operates <br>
 <br>Mishkin touched the young girl's head with an exploratory gesture. Then, swiftly, he <br>
turned up the two tabs and separated the halves of the skull. From within he drew out a <br>
printed circuit board. Soon he saw the damage and repaired it with professional <br>competence, noting the work on the inventory list pasted to the inside of the left <br>
hemisphere of the skull. Then he put the two halves of the skull back together, taking <br>care to bend the tabs carefully into place. The girl blinked her eyes and awakened, cured <br>
of her nervous tic and nocturnal enuresis. <br><b> <br> <br></b>45. Premature Conclusions <br>
 <br>Poor Ramsey Davis was impaled upon an ornamental iron railing at Thirteenth and <br>

Arctic behind a howling dog pack, herself howling, the dogs saying to each other, cWow, <br>freaky scene, man, like get me out of here.' Young David Broomsley died fever-twitched <br>
with clumsy face appalled. Mishkin himself was turned into a turnip by a malignant <br>magician and inadvertently eaten by Richard Southey of Charing Cross Road. Ormsley <br>never died and is still living in San Miguel de Allende, but his nose is in traction due to a <br>
rather unusual car accident. Orchidius is serving a ten-year sentence for mail fraud at <br>Fulsome Prison. He swears he is innocent, and money to help his appeal should be sent <br>
to the author, care of the publisher, and I'll do what I can to assist this unfortunate man. <br>Various creatures in this work died in various ways. The author of this work would like to <br>
go out snarling but will probably be reduced to snuffling. Peace be to all, and to all a <br>good night. <br>

Mishkin loped gracefully along the contours of his life, stopping now and again to <br>
change into levis, suede pants, black bandit hats, and pausing to eat an unscheduled <br>pizza here and there. Mishkin, slit-eyed against the wind of time, faintly smiling Mishkin, <br>
nerves twitching in the long, cold jaw, hard hands set on dream steering wheels. Prince <br>of jesters, Mishkin, with his clown's grin and his errand boy mendacity. Was he not <br>
disastrous, unscheduled? Mishkin, of the bright, fey smile and winsome ways, dappling <br>his way through all his completions. Mishkin in there for the big fifty-cent ride of all the <br>amusements, holding on to his identity for dear life as the merry-go-round swirled his <br>
images about like dead leaves. Mishkin pretended to be who he was. <br><b> <br> <br></b>47  <br>
Mishkin sat in the Memory Theatre and scratched his crotch. On the stage, brilliantly <br>
lighted, a tableau appeared: a woman holding a baby. Mishkin recognized them as his <br>own. A great voice called out, `What do you feel, Mishkin?' And Mishkin replied, `I feel an <br>itch in my crotch. Also, I have a feeling that I forgot to file this year's income tax.' <br>

And so on and so on and so on. <br>
As for me, I'm doing as well as can be expected. I entered the Game late, and I still <br>
have a lot of malimprinting to overcome. I have been able to master primary life <br>

There are a lot of saints around, as always, and most of them smell bad, as always. <br>
There's no accounting for fads. <br>
Well, that's all the local news that I can think of just now, and I want to get this out to <br>
you in a hurry. I still don't know why you've picked an exterior adventure rather than an <br>interior one. Soft spot in the old psyche? Or are you pulling a reverse on us, you sly dog? <br>It would be just like you to manifest a simple little ext. adv. spacefiight and then fool us <br>
by plunging into the pit of unmitigated self! (But if that's the case, how did you find the <br>interface? Or are you pulling a double reverse? The `mind' boggles.) <br>
I'll just assume that you've chosen a complex way of getting into (or out of) Maya and <br>
that there's no need for me to remind you of the pitfalls and perils involved, since you <br>
know more than I do about mirror-deformations in the theatre of self. Of course, I just <br>now <i>have </i>reminded you; but I don't mean to be insulting, I know that even the greatest <br>
adepts can profit from the words of a fool. <br>
Your wives have remarried, as you must have foreseen. Some of your children have <br>

<A name=42></a><b> <br> <br></b>51. Reminder <br>
 <br>Mishkin saw a tape recorder on stilts. He went over and turned it on. The recorder <br>
said: `This is a recorded message to remind you not to forget to record a message to <br>
remind you not to forget.' <br><b> <br> <br></b>52 <br>
 <br>`Yep, sonny, it's quite a sight--the biggest cause and effect factory in the whole <br>
danged galaxy. Works simple enough. We put the causes into this hopper and the effects <br>
into this hopper. Then the machinery takes over, and there's a lot of clanging and <br>banging, and the product comes out over here--a nicely bonded cause-and-effect without <br>
a single seam visible to the naked eye. Our cause-and-effect bonds will stand up in any <br>court of law anywhere. <br>
`We don't have no truck with them newfangled ideas about discontinuity and <br>
synchronicity and all that crap. Around here, if a horse kicks you, you get a broken leg, <br>and if you've got a bellyache it's because you ate Italian sausage last night. That way <br>
everybody knows where they stand.' <br>
 <br>`Well, damnation, I don't know why a thing like that had to go and happen. Still, <br>
sometimes it does happen. Sometimes a cause and effect absolutely refuse to bond. <br>
When that happens, and we ain't got no explanation for something, we call it God's Will. <br>So I guess it was God's Will that this happened now with you, and I think we should <br>
kneel down for a moment of silent prayer.' <br><b> <br> <br></b>53 <br>
 <br>Mishkin came to a long line of men. The man on the extreme left was listening to a <br>
transistor radio tuned very low. He heard something, turned to the man on his right, <br>
whispered, `You only live once. Pass it on.' <br><b> <br> <br></b>54 <br>
 <br>Tom Mishkin and James Bradley Sooner sat down to the meal. The mouse jumped on <br>
to the table and began lugging plates around, serving mashed potatoes, cutting the roast <br>
beef. Mishkin asked, `Does he always do that?' <br>
The mouse said, `I will admit that it is a curious situation. Allow me to explain. For one <br>
thing, I am Jewish. For another...' <br>
`Serve the goddamned food!' Sooner roared. <br>
`Don't get so excited,' the mouse said and went back to work. <br>`Now, about this strange thing that happened to me,' Sooner said. <br>

 <br>`How long do the hallucinations go on?' Mishkin asked. <br>`Not long enough.' <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>57  <br>
`What is this?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`This,' Orchidius said, `is a device for altering reality.' <br>The object was the size and shape of an ostrich's egg. It had a single toggle switch. <br>
One side was marked, `On'. The other side was marked, `Off'. The switch was turned to <br>`Off'. <br>
`Where did you get it?' <br>`I bought it at the Whole Earth Store,' Orchidius said. `It cost $9.95.' <br>`Does it really alter reality?' <br>
`It's supposed to. I haven't tried it yet.' <br>`How could it?' Mishkin asked. `How could anything alter reality for $9.95?' <br>
`At that price it sounded too good to pass up,' Orchidius said. `But I guess it can't <br>
work.' <br>
`You can't be sure,' Mishkin said. `You haven't tried it yet.' <br>`I don't suppose it's really necessary to try it,' Orchidius said. <br>
`Of course it is! Push the switch!' <br>`You push it.' <br>`All right, I'll push it.' Mishkin took the egg and pushed the switch `On'. They both <br>
waited for several seconds. <br>
`Nothing happened,' Orchidius said. <br>
`I guess not. But how would we know it if something did happen? I mean, whatever <br>
happened would still seem like reality to us.' <br>
`That's true.' <br>`Maybe you'd better turn it off.' <br>
`Turn what off?' Sooner asked. <br>

`How long will the hallucinations continue?' Mishkin asked. <br>
`What hallucinations?' <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>61  <br>
Mishkin, at the age of twelve, loved God so greatly that he broke his marriage vows to <br>
himself. <br>
 <br>Mishkin was unfaithful to himself again today, preferring the affections of a stylish <br>
sports car and a suede jacket to the ardent constancy and unstinting love of Mishkin. <br>
 <br>`Your problem,' the analyst said, `is an inability to love yourself.' <br>`But I do love myself!' Mishkin declared. `I do! I really do!' <br>
`Do you expect me to believe that?' the analyst asked. `I saw you looking at Sartre, <br>
Camus, Montaigne, Plato, Thoreau--to mention only a few of your lights o'love. When will <br>you stop having these absurd, incessant, and unrewarding affairs?' <br>
`I love myself,' Mishkin wept. `I really do.' <br>`Still smoking,' the analyst noted. `Still lethargic, passive, uncontrolled. Is this the way <br>
you treat one whom you claim to love?' <br><b> <br> <br></b>62  <br>
Deep in the woods, Mishkin found an apostrophe. It was lost and crying softly to itself. <br>
Mishkin took it in his arms and stroked its soft fur. The apostrophe sank its curved claws <br>
into Mishkin's shoulder. Mishkin ignored the pain and continued to smoke his cigarette. <br>
 <br>They took his card and punched it. At once he felt relief, and then boredom, and then <br>
anxiety. He felt fine as soon as they put a new card into his hand. <br>
 <br>The footprints continued into the woods. Mishkin followed them. He was well armed, <br>
prepared to face the fabulous beast. At last he saw it ahead of him and hastily fired. Too <br>late he realized that he had shot one of his avatars. The avatar expired. Mishkin felt a <br>sense of loss that became, inevitably, a sense of relief. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>63. The Sorrows of the Man of a Thousand Disguises <br>
 <br>The Man of a Thousand Disguises sat in his temporary office and considered the <br>
problem of Mishkin and the engine part. Somehow, the two would not come together, the <br>
desired juxtaposition would not come off. There was no flow towards the desired <br>objective. <br>
Because of the difficulties inherent in this problem, The Man had been forced to invent <br>
himself--a  <i>deus ex machina--</i>now standing tongue-tied in front of the audience and <br>endeavouring to explain what was to himself still inexplicable. <br>
Having constructed himself, The Man of a Thousand Disguises was now stuck with <br>
himself. Did he also have to explain himself? Quickly, he abolished the necessity for <br>
doing so. He only had to explain about how Mishkin and the engine part came together. <br>But how in fact <i>did </i>they come together? Did they really have to? <br>
 <br>`And so they came to their untimely ends, Mishkin, the cosmic jester, and the engine <br>
part, which was the cruel and paradoxical point of his joke. Yes, they perished, and at <br>
the same time the Earth fell into the sun, the sun blew up, and the entire galaxy fell <br>through a black hole in the fabric of space-time, thus obliterating the tragi-comedy of <br>
human existence, and indeed, all dramas, all existences.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=45></a> <br>No, delicious though it was, it simply wouldn't do. Mishkin and his engine part had to <br>
get together, the original problem had to be solved, all promises and premises had to be <br>kept. After that was done, everything could be blown up but not before. <br>
So there it was again: The Man of a Thousand Disguises still had the unhappy duty of <br>
accomplishing the job for which he had created himself. <br>
He thought. Nothing intruded upon his disastrous solitude. Stray conceptions clouded <br>
his mind: `Any drug that fucks you up is good'. `Depression is inevitable'. `Concomitants'. <br>
`Paris'. <br>
With an effort The Man forced his attention towards the engine part. Where was the <br>
damned thing now? In some dusty warehouse on Earth, presumably, awaiting extrication <br>
for the delectation of the patient reader. <br>
`But who needs a reader who's a patient?' The Man snarled. Nevertheless, there it <br>
was: He was under contractual obligation to himself to construct a ballet for catatonics. <br>
The Man tried to pull himself together. `I am losing my mind.' `Nonexistent problems <br>
have the maximum reality.' `Not exactly what we had in mind.' <br>
How true it was! People who live in glass psyches shouldn't cast words. <br>
 <br>To work: The Man of a Thousand Disguises picked up his analogic slide rule and <br>
inferential stylus. Now then: engine part become eagle heart, standing start, running <br>
water, ice. So much for the J series. Again now: treasure in the earth, crystal goblet, <br>lathe, laughter, bat, slink, reduction gear. <br>
More like it! <br>Moving with more confidence now, The Man put all the available data into the recycler <br>
and let it stand for three revolutions. Then he pressed the Outcome button. Up came an <br>antelope mounted on a polar bear. Worthless! But wait a minute now--<i>polar bear--</i>yes, <br>
it's coming: <i>polarity bears ante lope! </i>A yin function breach delivery, definitely productive. <br>
Now to put it all through the constructs simulator. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>64. The Reality Principle Revisited <br>
 <br>Johnny Allegro was feeling out of sorts that morning. He set the derby on his black <br>
glossy hair. Carefully, he straightened the cuffs of his chocolate mohair shirt. Now he was <br>ready for business. <br>
The telephone rang. Allegro pounced on it. `Allegro speaking.' <br>`Johnny? This is Harry van Orlen.' <br>Allegro pictured the big-bellied, slack-jawed gunman with the heavily stubbled jaws <br>
and the grimy fingernails. <br>
`Well, what is it?' Johnny snapped. He hated cheap gunsels, even though his work <br>
frequently required him to spend eighteen hours a day with them. <br>
`It's like this, Johnny. Do you remember that job we did on South Main Street?' <br>
`Yeah,' Johnny snarled, recognizing at once the euphemism referring to the recent <br>
burglary of the Wel-Rite Storage Company on Varick Street. <br>
`Well, we found buyers for all the inventory except one piece of hardware we're still <br>
stuck with.' <br>
`What kind of a product is it?' Johnny asked. <br>
`It's some sort of gadget labelled Spaceship Engine Part L-1223A. It was supposed to <br>
be sent to some guy named Mishkin in some place called Harmonia.' <br>
`So, sell it.' <br>`Nobody wants it.' <br>
`Then dump it somewhere.' Johnny slammed down the telephone, scowling. He hated <br>
it when his underlings bothered him with questions that an ape would be able to solve <br>
while going downhill on roller skates. But he also hated unwarranted initiative. <br>
Just then a thought occurred to him: Maybe he should send that engine part to that <br>
guy, what was his name, that Mishkin, thus acquiring for himself the reputation of an <br>
eccentric philanthropist. Then he could do a few more nice things and maybe after that <br>run for elected office. <br>
 <br>


<A name=46></a>This notion suited Johnny's strange notions of <i>noblesse oblige. </i>He reached for the <br>
telephone. <br>
Just then the door burst open and three policemen and an author burst into the room <br>
with drawn guns. <br>
Johnny snarled in rage. His lightning-quick reflexes enabled him to dive beneath the <br>
desk before the policemen's bullets ripped through the space where he had just been. <br>
`Get him!' screamed the author. `He knows where the part is!' <br>But Johnny had already pushed the blue button under his desk. A section of floor <br>
opened under him and Johnny fell through a chute that led to the garage where his <br>Mercedes SL 300 was waiting, its motor ticking over quietly. <br><b> <br> <br></b>65  <br>
Some days later, on the cool, raffia-covered veranda of the large, weather-beaten <br>
house on lower Key Largo, Professor John O. MacAllister was undergoing a moment of <br>severe perplexity. This was unusual for the tall, strongly built, sandy-haired physicist <br>
from Rockport, Maine. Beside him was Lois, his tall, attractive, chestnut-haired wife. She <br>had just entered the veranda. <br>
Before Lois had a chance to speak, towheaded Tyie Oliver ran up on to the cool <br>
veranda with a five ball in his hand. `Pool, anyone?' he asked fatuously. <br>
`Not just now, Tyie,' said Professor MacAllister in quiet tones. <br>
Tyie turned to go. But then it became apparent, even to his untrained and <br>
unobservant eye, that there was something strange and unnatural in the bearing of the <br>
two people he had known for only a month but already prized more than anyone in the <br>world. <br>
`Is anything the matter?' Tyie asked. <br>Before anyone could answer, Lois MacAllister's younger sister, Patty, came down the <br>
inner steps and out on to the veranda. Not yet seventeen, Patty was singularly developed <br>
for her age. She sat down in a faded green armchair and crossed the long, generously <br>curved legs that fell from the slender waist below her ample and delicately shaped <br>
breasts. <br>
`Yes, John,' she said, tart-sweet, <i>`is </i>anything the matter?' <br>
Professor MacAllister went a shade pale beneath the healthy glow of his tan. He noted <br>
that his wife's grey eyes had widened. Quietly, he said, `Now, wait just a minute...' <br>
The kitchen door opened. Out on to the veranda came Chang, the Chinese cook, <br>
Kyoto, the Philippine houseboy, and Mary Lou, the Jamaican housekeeper. They ranged <br>themselves silently along the wall. And now it was Patty's turn to go pale. <br>
There was a long silence. Then Tyie said, `Uh, I guess I'd better be getting home. The <br>
paint on the birdcage is probably dry by now, and I...' <br>
`Don't rush away, Tyie,' said Lois MacAllister. `There's someone here I think you should <br>
meet.' <br>
The cellar door opened and out on to the veranda came a bald, one-eyed dwarf, a thin <br>
man in a black suit, and a pair of giggling, blonde, female twins. <br>
`Now I think we can clear this thing up,' MacAllister said. `First, as to the so-called <br>
mysterious package that Ed Whittaker found in the bilge of the garbage scow, <i>Clotilda, <br></i>just two days before his disappearance...' <br>
`Yes?' Patty breathed. <br>`It contained nothing more than an engine part for a spaceship. It was supposed to be <br>
sent to a Mr Mishkin of Harmonia, and in the presence of Judge Clarke I forwarded it to <br>the Dade County Emergency Expediting Service.' <br>
Patty slumped back, her body slack with relief. `Well, that takes care of that! We've all <br>
been a pack of fools!' <br>
`Maybe,' said Lois MacAllister. `But we still haven't heard any explanation for the rest <br>
of it.' <br>
Professor MacAllister looked thoughtfully at the people on the veranda. `That,' he said, <br>
`may take a little longer.' He went to the sideboard and poured himself a drink. <br><b> <br> </b><br>

<A name=47></a>66 <br>
 <br>The sign on the door read: CONTINUITIES, INC. Uncle Arnold went inside and was <br>
shown to the office of Thomas Grantwell. <br>
`I've come here about my nephew,' Uncle Arnold said. `Tom Mishkin is his name. He's <br>
stranded on a planet called Harmonia, and he's gotta have a certain engine part so's he <br>
can make his spaceship run again. But I can't seem to get the part to him.' <br>
`Have you tried shipping it by space freight?' Grantwell asked. <br>
`I have. But they told me that the Interstellar Space Flight Premise had been <br>
suspended this year, and therefore they were unable to help me' <br>
`Did you ask them what was supposed to happen to your nephew?' <br>
`They said that they would provisionally have to deny his existence until the Premise <br>
was reinstated.' <br>
`That's government for you,' Grantwell said. `Leaves you--or rather young Mishkin--in <br>
quite a spot.' <br>
`Is there anything your organization can do to help the lad?' asked Uncle Arnold. <br>`There is,' Grantwell said, firmly. `Continuities, Inc was designed to create connections <br>
between incompatible assumptions. We will design a scenario that will provide a link <br>between these two different realities without doing violence to either.' <br>
`That's wonderful,' Uncle Arnold said. <br>
And so it came to pass that all the toads were smoothed over and various elephants <br>
were secretly enlisted. The next step was more severe: suitable gapping material had to <br>
be found, heads had to be turned, performances judged. Spontaneity died in Kansas City <br>and was replaced by probity. <br>
Gigantic mechanisms were turned loose upon a suspecting Earth. Various marches <br>
were organized. The input factory increased outputs. Crimson dagles carried darkness <br>
and invisibility. People decided things. There was a necessary series of transactions <br>conducted via radio and involving a compromise about permissible ratios of feeling. <br>
Nor was this all. The world stood revealed in dark vestments. Certain facts of long-<br>
established limpidity died aborning. The strain on the normative cause-and-effect <br>linkages was tremendous. Voices were raised in protest. Outright revolt was threatened. <br>
The author, in the meantime, had formed a dismal awareness of the difficulties <br>
involved. He toyed with various possibilities, even considered killing Mishkin off and <br>
starting a new book--a cookbook, perhaps. Still... <br><b> <br> <br></b>67. Peregrinations <br>
 <br>`Damn it all,' said Mishkin, `another zero-null game.' <br> <br>The engine part could be seen in all its splendour, isolated in the author's mind. It was <br>
a hazy visualization, sometimes resembling a pot roast, at other times a Citroen 2 cv. <br>
The part sounded like a rock band. It smelt like a butane burner. <br><b> <br> <br></b>68. Certificate of Unreality <br>
 <br>Mishkin was resting in a glade. The robot was enjoying a pseudo-rest, since he didn't <br>
need a real rest. Mishkin looked up and became aware that someone was striding across <br>
the sward towards him. <br>
`Hello, there,' said The Man of a Thousand Disguises. `I'm in charge of this sequence. I <br>
have come here in person to formalize a resolution.' <br>
`What are you talking about?' Mishkin asked. `I'm just waiting here for a spaceship <br>
part.' <br>
The Man grimaced. `I'm terribly sorry about that, but you see, we are no longer <br>
entertaining that premise. The whole conception of you on an alien planet, waiting for a <br>
spaceship part-well, it had been declared dramatically unsound. Therefore, we are <br>scrapping it.' <br>
`Does that mean that you are also scrapping me?' <br>
 <br>


<A name=48></a>The Man looked at him unhappily. `Well, yes, I'm afraid that it does. We have found a <br>
new hero to take your place.' <br>
 <br>THE NEW HERO <br>
 <br>He was complicated, devious, terribly attractive, masculine, universal. He had <br>
idiosyncracies, habits, traits. He had soul, pzazz, vital juices. He had a sex life. He had a <br>complicated and ambiguous history. He had a little mole to the left of his nose. He had <br>
satanic eyebrows. He was a knockout. <br>
`This is your replacement,' said The Man. `You've done your best, Mishkin. It's no fault <br>
of yours if you've gotten into this untenable situation. But really, we must end this thing, <br>
and to do that we need some cooperation from our characters, and you - well, you <br>simply don't have any <i>characteristics </i>for us to work with.' <br>
Mishkin instantly developed a facial tic, a stammer, a way of biting his lips before and <br>
after speaking, a moustache, and a removable false tooth. <br>
`Sorry, it's not quite what we had in mind,' said The Man. `Now, I will just leave you <br>
boys to get acquainted.' The Man turned himself into a tree. <br>
 <br>MR MISHKIN MEETS MR HERO <br> <br>`How do you do?' Mishkin said. <br>`How do you do?' said Mr Hero. <br>
`Would you care for a nice cup of coffee?' said Mishkin. <br>`Thanks, that would be nice,' said Mr Hero. <br>
Mishkin poured coffee. They sipped in silence. <br>Mr Hero said, `Nice weather we've been having.' <br>
`Where?' Mishkin said. <br>`Oh, in Limbo,' said Mr Hero. `I've been waiting there with the other archetypes.' <br>`It's been nice here, too,' Mishkin said. <br>
The tree changed into The Man. `Interact!' he hissed and turned into a tree again. <br>Mr Hero smiled diffidently. `Rather an awkward situation, isn't it?' <br>
`I suppose it is,' Mishkin said. `Personally, ever since I started this thing I've been in <br>
just one awkward situation after another. Maybe a rest would do me good.' <br>
`Yes,'  said  Mr  Hero.  `But  before  that,  it  would  be  terribly  good  of  you  to  explain  the <br>
ropes to me. I mean, new man on the job, and all that...' He broke off with an <br>
embarrassed laugh. <br>
`Well,' Mishkin said, `there's not much to explain. You just go along and things happen <br>
to you.' <br>
`But that's rather--<i>passive--</i>isn't it?' <br>`Sure, it is. But it's that kind of adventure.' <br>
`What about motivation?' asked Mr Hero. <br>`As far as I know,' Mishkin said, `you're looking for a spaceship part.' <br>
`A what?' <br>`A part to replace a broken part in your spaceship. Without it your spaceship won't <br>
run. And that means you can't get back to Earth. And you do want to get back to Earth--<br>that's an unspoken assumption that I personally think ought to be examined. Anyhow, <br>that's your motivation.' <br>
`I see,' said Mr Hero. `Not much you can get your <i>teeth </i>into, is there?' <br>`It's no Oedipus Rex,' Mishkin admitted. `But then, what is?' <br>
Mr Hero chuckled appreciatively. `That's terribly true, what is, indeed? Well, now, who <br>
is this other chap?' <br>
`He's a robot,' Mishkin said. <br>`Why is he here?' <br>
`I can't remember the original reason. But mainly he's here so that you won't have to <br>
talk to yourself.' <br>
Mr Hero looked at the robot apprehensively. `My mother was raped by a robot,' he <br>
remarked. `That's her story. The robot said that he mistook her for a refrigerator. I've felt <br>dodgy about robots ever since. Is this robot a nice robot?' <br>
 <br>


<A name=49></a>The robot looked up. `Yes,' he said, `I'm a nice robot, especially when people have the <br>
common courtesy to address me as if I am here when I am here, rather than speaking as <br>
if I weren't here, which, frankly, the way things are going these days, I'd just as soon <br>rather not be.' <br>
`Prolix, isn't he?' said Mr Hero. <br>`If you don't like it,' said the robot, `you can always stuff it up your nose.' <br>
Mr Hero rolled his eyes, then abruptly giggled. <br> <br>The Man transformed himself from a tree into The Man. `That's it,' he said. `I'm sorry, <br>
Mr Hero, but you don't seem to be the type we had in mind.' <br>
`So where's that at?' Mr Hero said haughtily, `Can I help it if you don't know what <br>
you're doing?' <br>
`Go back at once to the collective pool of the unconscious,' said The Man. <br>
Mr Hero vanished with hauteur. <br>`Now we're back where we started from,' Mishkin said. <br>
`That was my line,' the robot said. <br>`Shut up,' said The Man. `I gotta think.' He sat down upon a rock--a tall, sombre, <br>
light-haired man with a moustache and a terribly attractive way with women. His long, <br>strong fingers rippled as he tapped them on one bony knee. There were dark shadows <br>hiding his smouldering eyes. He was a knockout. But he wasn't happy. No, he wasn't <br>
happy. Perhaps he would never be happy. Had not Dr Lifshultz told him once, `Happiness <br>is just a thing called Joe.' And The Man's name was not Joe. So he was not happiness nor <br>
were any of his pursuits or practices. <br>
 <br>
<b> <br></b>PART TWO <br>
 <br>69. And so Once More Into the Breach, Brave Friends <br>
 <br>The prau glided over the clear waters of the creek, guided by the deft paddle of the <br>
aged Dayak who brought the frail craft expertly alongside the bamboo dock that <br>
connected the village of Omandrik with the outside world. <br>
A white man--an American--dressed in mosquito boots, jodhpurs, a sweat-stained <br>
white shirt and crushed bush hat, had been watching the arrival of the native craft from <br>the relative coolness of the long-shadowed veranda of his house. He rose without haste <br>
and checked the chambers of the .38 calibre Cross &amp; Blackwell revolver that he habitually <br>carried in a well-oiled chamois holster strapped under his right armpit. Then, moving <br>easily through the sultry tropic heat, he shambled down to the pier. <br>
The first man to step off the ancient steamboat was a tall Arab in flowing white robes <br>
and a white and yellow headdress of the Hadhramaut. He was followed by an enormously <br>
fat man of indeterminate age, wearing a red fez, a crumpled suit of white silk, and <br>sandals. The fat man might have been taken for Turkish, but a keen observer, noting the <br>
faintly slanted green eyes nearly lost in rolls of fat, would have guessed him to be a <br>Hungarian from the Carpathian steppes. He was followed by a short, emaciated, <br>
provisional English boy of some twenty years of age, whose over-quick gestures and <br>trembling hands proclaimed a terminal amphetamine user and beneath whose denim <br>jacket might be glimpsed the dull-grey corrugated surface of a hand grenade. Lastly, a <br>
girl stepped off the boat, smartly dressed in a flowered cotton shift, with long dark hair <br>streaming over her shoulders, her beautiful features betraying no hint of emotionality. <br>
The new arrivals nodded to the American on the dock, but no words were exchanged <br>
until they had all assembled on the veranda, leaving the helicopter pilot to tie down his <br>
craft with the help of several good-natured natives. <br>
They sat in bamboo armchairs, and a white-coated house-boy brought round a tray of <br>
icy gin pahits. The fat man lifted his glass in silent tribute and said, `You seem to be <br>doing nicely for yourself, Jamieson.' <br>
`I can't kick,' the hard-faced American replied. `I'm the only trader in these parts, you <br>
know. I do a fair business in emeralds. Then there's the rare birds and butterflies, and a <br>little gold gets panned in the alluvial streams inland, and an occasional trinket comes my <br>
 <br>


<A name=50></a>way from the Khomar tombs. And, of course, I pick up <i>various other things </i>from time to <br>time.' <br>
`One is surprised at your convenient lack of competitors,' said the Arab, in flawless <br>
Lancashire English. <br>
The American smiled without humour. `The natives around here wouldn't allow it. I'm <br>
something of a god to them, you know.' <br>
`I have heard something about that,' the fat man said. `Rumour has it that you <br>
paddled in here about six years ago, more dead than alive, without a possession to your <br>
name except a pack containing five thousand doses of anti-plague serum.' <br>
`I heard the same story,' said the Arab. `And a week later half the population was <br>
down with bubonic.' <br>
`Just a lucky break for me,' said the unsmiling American. `I was right glad to be of <br>
assistance.' <br>
`By gad, sir,' said the fat man, `I drink to you! I do admire a man who makes his own <br>
luck.' <br>
`What do you mean by that?' Jamieson asked. <br>There was a short, ominous silence. But the tension was broken by the sound of the <br>
girl laughing. <br>
The men stared at her. Jamieson frowned and seemed about to question her <br>
misplaced levity. Then he noticed that the English speed freak had his right hand close to <br>
the white bone handle of the long knife he carried under his shirt in a white leather pouch <br>between his scrawny shoulder blades. <br>
`Something itchin' you, son?' Jamieson asked, with deadly mildness. <br>`If there is I'll let you know,' said the boy, his blue eyes blazing. `And my name isn't <br>
&quot;son&quot;, it's Billy Banterville. That's who I am and who I expect to be, and anyone who <br>says otherwise is a dirty liar and I'll be pleased to take him apart--take him apart--take <br>
him apart... Oh, my God, my skin is crawling off, what's happening to my skin, who lit <br>the fuses of my nerves, why is my brain boiling? My head hurts, I need, I need.' <br>
The fat man looked towards the Arab and nodded imperceptibly. The Arab took a <br>
hypodermic syringe from a flat, black leather case, filled it with a colourless liquid from a <br>plastic ampoule, and deftly injected the solution into the boy's arm. Billy Banterville <br>
smiled and lay back in his chair like a jointless puppet, his pupils so enlarged that no <br>whites could be seen, an expression of indescribable happiness upon his thin, tight face. <br>
A moment later he vanished. <br>
`Good riddance,' said Jamieson, who had watched all of this without comment. `Why <br>
did you bother to keep a character like that?' <br>
`He had his uses,' said the fat man. <br>The girl had herself under control now. She said, `That's it, you see. Each of us has his <br>
uses, each of us has something that is necessary to the others. You might consider us a <br>corporate entity.' <br>
`I see,' said Jamieson, although he didn't. `So each of you is irreplaceable.' <br>`Not  at  all,'  said  the  girl.  `Quite  the  contrary.  Each  of  us  stands  in  constant  fear  of <br>
replacement. That is why we try to stay always in each other's company--to avoid <br>sudden and premature replacement.' <br>
`I don't get it,' Jamieson said, although he did. He waited, but it became evident that <br>
no one was going to expatiate upon the subject. Jamieson shrugged his shoulders, <br>suddenly ill at ease in the uncanny silence. He said, `I suppose you'd like to get down to <br>
business?' <br>
`If it would not be too much trouble,' said the tall Arab. <br>
`Sure,' Jamieson said. The Arab made him feel  uneasy.  All  of  them  made  him  feel <br>
uneasy. All except the girl. He had some ideas about her--and some plans. <br>
 <br>Fifty yards from Jamieson's house the laboriously cleared area ended and jungle <br>
abruptly began--a green, vertical labyrinth in which a seemingly infinite number of <br>randomly connected planes receded endlessly towards some unimaginable centre. The <br>jungle was infinite repetition, infinite regression, infinite despair. <br>
Standing just within the jungle margin, invisible to observers in the clearing, were two <br>
men. One was a native, a Malay to judge from his green and brown headband. He was of <br>
medium height, stocky and strongly built. His aspect was thoughtful, melancholic, tense. <br>
 <br>


<A name=51></a>His companion was a white man, tall, deeply tanned, perhaps thirty years of age, <br>
conventionally handsome, dressed in the yellow robe of a Buddhist monk. The <br>
incongruity between his appearance and his dress vanished in the fantastic contortions of <br>the surrounding jungle. <br>
The white man was seated cross-legged on the ground facing away from the clearing. <br>
He was in a state of extreme relaxation. His grey eyes seemed to be focused inward. <br>
Presently the native said, `Tuan, the man, Jamieson, has gone into his house.' <br>`Yes,' said the white man. <br>
`Now he returns. He is carrying an object wrapped in burlap. It is not a large object--<br>
perhaps one-fourth the size of a young elephant's head.' <br>
The white man did not answer. <br>
`Now he unwraps the burlap. Within, there is an object of metal. It is of a complicated <br>
shape.' <br>
The white man nodded. <br>`They have all gathered around the object,' the native went on. `They are pleased, <br>
they are smiling. No, not all of them. The Arab has a strange expression on his face. It is <br>not exactly displeasure. It is some emotion that I cannot describe. Yes, I can! The Arab <br>
knows something that the others don't. He is a man who thinks he has a secret <br>advantage.' <br>
`So much the worse for him,' the white man said. `The others have the safety of their <br>
ignorance. That one has the peril of his understanding.' <br>
`Do you foresee this, Tuan?' <br>
`I read what is written,' the white man said. `The ability to read is my curse.' <br>The native shuddered, fascinated and repelled. A strange pity welled up in him for this <br>
man of strange talents and great vulnerabilities. <br>
The white man said, `Now the fat man is holding the metal object. He gives money to <br>
Jamieson.' <br>
`Tuan, you are not even looking at them.' <br>`Nevertheless, I see.' <br>
The native shook himself like a dog. The gentle white man--his friend--had power but <br>
was himself the victim of greater power. Yes, but it was best not to think of such things, <br>
for the white man's destiny was not his destiny, and he thanked his God for that. <br>
`Now they are going inside Jamieson's house,' the native said. `But you know that, do <br>
you not, Tuan?' <br>
`I know. I am unable not to know.' <br>
`And you know what they are doing within the house?' <br>`This, too, I cannot avoid.' <br>The native said, impulsively, `Tell me only what I must hear.' <br>
`That is all I ever tell you,' the white man said. Then, without looking at the native, he <br>
said, `You should leave me, leave this place. You should go to another island, get a wife, <br>
go into business.' <br>
`No, Tuan. We are yoked together, you and I. There is no avoiding it. As you know.' <br>
`Yes, I know. But sometimes I hope I am wrong, just for once. I would give a great <br>
deal to be wrong.' <br>
`It is not in your nature.' <br>`Perhaps not. Still, I can hope.' The white man shrugged. `Now the fat man has put the <br>
metal object into a black leather satchel. They are all smiling and shaking hands and <br>
there is murder in the air. Come, let us go away now.' <br>
`Is there not a chance they will escape us?' <br>
`It no longer matters. The ending is wrought in iron. We will go away and eat now and <br>
then sleep.' <br>
`And then?' <br>The white man shook his head wearily. `You do not need to know that. Come.' <br>
They moved into the jungle. The native prowled with the silent grace of a tiger. The <br>
white man drifted like a ghost. <br><b> <br> </b><br>
 <br>


<A name=52></a>70 <br>
 <br>Less than a mile from Jamieson's house, down a narrow path hacked through the <br>
jungle, one came to the native settlement of Omandrik. At first glance this was a typical <br>
Tamili village, identical to a hundred others that could be found perched precariously <br>along the banks of the Semil River--that lost brown stream that seemed barely to have <br>
the energy to flow through the devouring sunburned country to the distant, shallow, <br>reef-strewn waters of the East Java Sea. <br>
But an observant eye, ranging across the village, would take in the small, <br>
unmistakable signs of neglect--thatch blown away on many of the huts, taro patches <br>overgrown with weeds, broken-hulled praus scattered along the river-bank. One also <br>
noticed indistinct black shapes scurrying between huts--an infestation of rats grown bold <br>enough to raid the forlorn gardens in daylight. This more than any other single thing <br>
demonstrated the apathy of the villagers, their weary state of demoralization. A proverb <br>of the coast asserts that the presence of rats in daylight means that the land is <br>
abandoned of the gods. <br>
In the centre of the village, in a hut nearly twice the size of the others, Amhdi, the <br>
headman, sat cross-legged in front of a battery-operated shortwave radio. The radio <br>gave off a low hiss of static, and its green signal indicator glowed like a panther's eye <br>caught in a moonbeam. This was all the radio was capable of, since it had lost its <br>
antenna long before old Amhdi had acquired it. But the static and the wavering green <br>light were marvels enough for the old man. The radio had become his spiritual <br>
counsellor. He consulted it every few days and declared that the spirits of the dead <br>whispered advice to him and that the spirit eye revealed marvels that could not be <br>
revealed. <br>
Tanine, his priest, had never been able to determine whether the old chief actually <br>
believed this nonsense or whether he used the `magic' radio out of a previously <br>unsuspected depth of guile to escape some of the more onerous mandates of the House <br>of the Knife. Standing near the old chief, arms folded, clad in a sombre pegatu with the <br>
sacred monkey's skull fastened to his high forehead, the priest decided that the chiefs <br>deception was largely unconscious: a will to escape domination and a will to believe <br>
neatly conjoined. Nor could the priest blame his headman, whatever his motive: the <br>years had not been kind to Amhdi, and the House of the Knife had been unable to <br>
alleviate his sufferings. The old man's attitude was understandable, not that that would <br>stop the priest from doing what he had to do, for an adept of the Snake-Redeemer had <br>
certain duties to fulfil no matter what violence they might do to his own emotions. <br>
`Well, Chief?' the priest asked.x <br>The old man looked up furtively. He turned off the radio; it was difficult to obtain <br>
batteries--the precious spirit food--from the violent trader in the big house by the river <br>bend. Besides, he had heard the message, the thin voice of his father, nearly lost in the <br>
whispering of a thousand other spirits, pleading, cursing, promising, seeking <br>communication with the living from their black house at the end of the world. <br>
`My wise ancient one has spoken to me,' Amhdi said. Never had he referred to his <br>
father by name or by relationship. <br>
`And what did he say, O Chief?' the priest asked, no hint of irony evident in the low, <br>
controlled voice. <br>
`He has told me what must be done about the strangers.' <br>
The priest nodded slowly: This was unusual. The headman detested making decisions, <br>
and his spirit voices usually advised him along the comfortable rut of inaction. So the old <br>
man was beginning to assert himself? Or could it be that his father, the legendary <br>warrior... No, it could not be. It simply could not be. <br>
The priest waited for his chief to tell him what the wise ancient one had advised about <br>
the strangers. But Amhdi seemed reluctant to talk. Perhaps he had sensed that he had <br>
gained a momentary advantage in a contest that the priest had thought long resolved. <br>Nothing could be read on the old man's face except its customary expression of baffled <br>avarice and weak guile. <br>

 <br>DO NOT GUT ALONG THE LINE <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>72 <br>
 <br>The port of Arachnis is situated on a misshapen arm of land extending into the sun-<br>
shattered waters of the East Java Sea. It is a typical South Asian city compounded of <br>
chaos, and intershot with strict and inexplicable rules of behaviour. The scent of a <br>hundred mingled and exotic spices perturbs the senses of the voyager while he is still <br>many miles at sea. These odours, in their ever-changing combinations, touch hidden <br>
sensations in the Westerner that are incalculable in their effect. Memories are elicited of <br>events never experienced by the individual; absurd and impossible sensations are stirred. <br>
This sensory onslaught cannot fail to have its impact upon the voyager accustomed to <br>the tepid reception afforded by the bland cities of the West. Effortlessly, the East <br>
penetrates the outer, rational, prosaic surface of the voyager's personality, shaping and <br>changing him, subjecting him to fragments of vision, moments of horror and illumination, <br>
to inimitable languors and abrupt passions. The approach to Arachnis is the first step into <br>a dream. <br>
Of course, all of this is unacknowledged by the sturdy Western traveller. It was not <br>
even considered by the two men and a woman who, at sunset, sailed their steam launch <br>into the crescent-shaped inner harbour of Arachnis. Their ignorance was childish and <br>
touching, but it was no defence against the unthinkable world that was engulfing them. <br>
 <br>They docked in gathering darkness. Their plans had long been made. Provision had <br>
been made for everything, for all the anticipated permutations of chance. Everything had <br>
been calculated except the incalculable. <br>
The Arab and the girl stayed on the boat and guarded the object in the burlap bag. <br>
The fat man left the boat and walked away from the harbour into the walled city, past <br>
the Street of Bird Sellers, the Street of Dogs, the Street of Forgetfulness, the Street of <br>Many Doors... Droll, the names they had, if one was in the mood for that sort of thing. <br>
 <br>


<A name=54></a>The fat man did not feel well. The motion of the boat had given him a queasiness that <br>
had not yet passed. His system had been subjected to various shocks, and he was not a <br>
man to adapt easily. <br>
Still, the work was nearly finished. It was amusing to remember how it had begun. An <br>
elderly man had contacted him. The elderly man wanted a certain object--an engine <br>part--delivered to a certain man, a relative, marooned on a planet called Harmonia, <br>
unable to return until he received the part for his disabled spaceship. The problem had <br>seemed straightforward enough--a simple matter of logistics. But there had been <br>
unforeseen complications, which had mounted until finally there seemed no way of <br>delivering the engine part--not until the young relative became an old man or a dead <br>man. Therefore, businessman that he was, the elderly gentleman had looked into other <br>
channels. And he had come upon the fat man. <br>
That, at least, was his story. It was as good as any other story, and almost as likely. <br>
And now the thing was nearly done. Already the fat man had put behind him the <br>
unresolved complications he had encountered while dealing with Jamieson, and by <br>
extension, with the local chief, his priest, and the mysterious white man in the jungle. <br>Everybody was mysterious until you knew their motivations (every situation was <br>
complicated as long as you stayed within its frame of reference). But people didn't realize <br>that a man could walk away, simply leave a situation unresolved, its riddles unanswered. <br>It required will power to do that and even more will power not to pursue unproductive <br>
questions such as: How had the engine part come to that unlikely village in southern <br>Asia; Who was the white man in the jungle and why was he so interested in the part; <br>
Why had the chief come to a decision now, after years of indecision; Why had Jamieson, <br>a shrewd trader, let the engine part go for so small a price; Why had no one interfered <br>
with the fat man and his helpers during their departure? And so on and so on, <i>ad <br>infinitum.</i> <br>
But the fat man had resisted the commonplace  traps  baited  with  curiosity.  He  knew <br>
that mystery is only a lack of data and that for all questions there are only a small <br>number of answers, infinitely repeated, typically banal. Curiosity kills. One simply had to <br>
leave behind all the enticing problems, the delicious irrationalities, and move on at the <br>proper time--as he had done. <br>
Everything was going very well indeed. The fat man was pleased. He only wished that <br>
the nagging hollowness in his stomach would pass. That and the vertigo. <br>
 <br>The Street of Monkeys, the Street of Twilight, the Street of Memory. What strange <br>
names these people chose! Or had the Tourist Board done the inventing? It didn't matter, <br>he had memorized his route long ago, he knew exactly how to proceed. He walked <br>without haste through the bazaar, past stacks of swords, baskets of green and orange <br>
nuts, piles of fat, silvery fish, past cotton cloth dyed the colours of the rainbow, past a <br>group of grinning black men beating on drums while a golden youth performed a dance, <br>
past jugglers and fire-eaters, past a man who sat quietly holding a gorilla on a leash. <br>
The heat was unusual even for the tropics, as were the smells--of spices, kerosene, <br>
charcoal, cooking oil, dung--and the sounds--chattering alien voices, squeak of a water <br>wheel, groaning of cattle, high-pitched bark of dogs, jingle of brass jewellery. <br>
There were other sounds, not to be identified: other scenes, not to be understood or <br>
assimilated. A man in a black headband was making a slow, deep incision in a boy's thigh <br>with an inlaid shell knife while a crowd watched and giggled. Five men solemnly pounded <br>
their fists against a strip of corrugated iron, the blood running down their arms. There <br>was a man with a blue stone in his turban that gave off wisps of white smoke. <br>
And yet overall there remained that sense of  vertigo  that  made  everything  turn  and <br>
fall slowly to the left--and the hollowness, as if he had lost something large and intimate <br>
from  within  him.  Business was not much fun when you were unwell: see a doctor in <br>Singapore next week, meanwhile walk past the Street of Thieves, Street of Deaths, <br>
Street of Forgetfulness--damn their pretentiousness--down the Street of the Maze, <br>Street of Desire, Street of Fish, Fulfilment, Nuts, Two Demons, Horses, and only a few <br>more blocks to Ahlid's house. <br>
A beggar clutched at his sleeve. `The smallest coin, compassionate one, that I may live <br>
one more day.' <br>
`I never give to beggars,' the fat man said. <br>
 <br>


<A name=55></a>`Never at all?' <br>`No. It is a matter of principle.' <br>
`Then take this,' the beggar said, and pressed into the fat man's hand a shrivelled fig. <br>`Why do you give this to me?' asked the fat man. <br>
`A matter of caprice. I am too poor to afford principles.' <br>The fat man moved on, holding the fig, unwilling to drop it while the beggar could still <br>
see him, his head spinning now, his legs beginning to tremble. <br>
He came to a fortune-telling booth. An aged crone blocked his way. <br>
`Learn your fortune, great sir! Learn what will become of you!' <br>`I never have my fortune told,' the fat man said. `A matter of principle.' But then he <br>
remembered the beggar. `Besides, I cannot afford it,' <br>
`You have the price in your hand!' the crone said. She took the fig from him and led <br>
him to her booth. She took a bronze jar and spilled its contents on to the counter. In the <br>
jar there were twenty or thirty coins of many shapes, sizes, and colours. She studied <br>them intently and looked at the fat man. <br>
`I see change and becoming,' she said. `I see resistance, then yielding, then defeat, <br>
then victory. I see completion and beginning again.' <br>
`Can't you be more specific?' asked the fat man. His forehead and cheeks were <br>
burning. His throat was dry and it was painful to swallow. <br>
`Of course, I can,' the old woman said. `But I won't, since compassion is a virtue and <br>
you are an attractive man.' <br>
She turned away abruptly. The fat man picked up a small coin of hammered iron from <br>
the counter and walked away. <br>
Street of Initiation, Street of Ivory. <br>
A woman stopped him. She was neither young nor old. She had strong features, dark <br>
eyes rimmed with kohl, lips painted with ochre. `My darling,' she said, `my full moon, my <br>
palm tree! The price is cheap, the pleasure is unforgettable.' <br>
`I think not,' the fat man said. <br>`Think of the pleasure, my beloved, the pleasure!' <br>
And, strangely, the fat man knew that he would enjoy this dirty, diseased woman of <br>
the streets, enjoy her more than the predictable and sterile couplings he had experienced <br>
in the past. Onset of romanticism! But it was out of the question, syphilis was rampant in <br>this place, he didn't have the time, he couldn't stop now. <br>
`Some other time,' he said. <br>`Alas! That will never be!' <br>
`You can never tell.' <br>She looked boldly into his eyes. `Sometimes you can tell. It will never be.' <br>`Take this to remember me by,' the fat man said and pushed the iron coin into her <br>
hand. <br>
`It is wise of you to pay,' she said. `Soon you will see what you have bought.' <br>
The fat man turned away and continued to walk mechanically. His joints ached. <br>
Definitely, he was not well. Street of the Razor, Street of the End, and now he had come <br>
to the house of the merchant Ahlid. <br><b> <br> <br></b>73 <br>
 <br>The fat man knocked at the great brass-studded door of Ahlid's house. A servant let <br>
him in and took him through an inner courtyard to a cool, dim, high-ceilinged room. The <br>
fat man felt relieved to sit on soft brocaded cushions and to sip iced mint tea from a <br>frosted silver glass. But he still felt strange and out of sorts, and the vertigo had not left <br>
him. His condition annoyed him. It was most inconvenient. <br>
Ahlid entered the room, a quiet, slender man in his fifties. The fat man had saved his <br>
life during a time of riots in Mukhtail. Ahlid had been grateful, and more important, <br>reliable. They had done business together in Aden, Port Sudan, and Karachi. They had <br>not met since Ahlid had moved to Arachnis some years ago. <br>
Ahlid inquired about the fat man's health and listened with grave concern to his <br>
indispositions. <br>
 <br>


<A name=56></a>`It seems that I cannot take this climate,' the fat man said. `But it is of no concern. <br>
How are you, my friend, and how is your wife and child?' <br>
`I am well enough,' said Ahlid. `Despite the unsettled times, I manage to earn a <br>
sufficient living. My wife died two years ago of a snakebite suffered in the bazaar. My <br>
daughter is well enough; later you will meet her.' <br>
The fat man murmured his regrets. Ahlid thanked him and said, `One learns how to <br>
live with Death in this city. Death is present everywhere in the world, of course, and in <br>due time takes everyone; but in other cities he is less publicly evident. Elsewhere, Death <br>
makes his customary rounds of the hospitals, goes for a drive on the highway, takes a <br>stroll around town to visit the needy, and generally comports himself like a respectable <br>citizen. To be sure, he arranges a few surprises now and again; but in general he does <br>
his work as expected and tries not to disrupt the reasonable hopes and expectations of <br>sober and respectable men. <br>
`But here in Arachnis, Death behaves in quite a different way. Perhaps he is affected <br>
by the fierce sun and the marshy land, perhaps they are responsible for making him <br>
moody, capricious, and unrelenting. Whatever the causes, Death is ubiquitous and <br>unexpected here, taking delight in sudden surprises and reversals, visiting all parts of the <br>
city, not even respecting the mosques and palaces where a man might expect some <br>small measure of security. Here, Death is no longer a good citizen. Here he is a cheap <br>dramatist.' <br>
 <br>`I beg your pardon,' the fat man said. `I seem to have dozed off. The heat... What <br>
have we been talking about?' <br>
`You had inquired about my daughter,' said Ahlid. `She is seventeen years old. Perhaps <br>
you would like to meet her now?' <br>
`Delighted, delighted,' said the fat man. <br>
Ahlid led him through dark corridors, up a wide staircase, then through a gallery <br>
whose narrow, slit windows looked down upon an interior patio with a fountain. They <br>came to a door. Ahlid knocked, and opened it. <br>
The room was brilliantly lighted. The floor was of black marble, into which a great <br>
number of white lines had been let. The lines crossed and recrossed each other at <br>
irregular intervals like a tangle of twine. In the centre of the room sat a grave, dark-eyed <br>girl, dressed in white, stitching on a little embroidery frame. <br>
`Charming,' said the fat man. The girl did not look up. The tip of her tongue stood out <br>
as she concentrated on her design. The pattern of her embroidery was poorly executed, <br>
chaotic. <br>
`She is docile,' said Ahlid. <br> <br>The fat man rubbed his eyes. With  an  effort  he  sat  upright in his chair. He was in <br>
Ahlid's salon again, seated on brocade cushions. Ahlid was writing in an account book. In <br>
front of the fat man there was a half-eaten cup of sherbet. <br>
The fat man said, `Please excuse my lapses. I have not been well. Perhaps it would be <br>
best if we discussed business.' <br>
`Just as you please,' Ahlid said. <br>
`I have come here,' the fat man said, `to arrange, with your help, and at a mutually <br>
agreeable price, to... I have a certain object in my possession, of no intrinsic importance <br>except to the man who... I wish to transport a certain engine part to a certain place, and <br>
I am confident that I, or rather, you, can accomplish... I seem to be having difficulty in <br>expressing myself. This thing that I wish to accomplish...' <br>
`My friend,' said Ahlid, `isn't it time that we talked seriously?' <br>`Yes? I can assure you...' <br>
`Isn't it time that we talked about what you would like to do with the little time <br>
remaining to you?' Ahlid asked. <br>
The fat man managed to smile. `I will admit that I am indisposed. But no one can <br>
know...' <br>
`Please,' said Ahlid. `My friend, my benefactor, I am very sorry to have to tell you that <br>
you have the plague.' <br>
`Plague? Don't be ridiculous. I grant that I am not well. I will consult a doctor.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=57></a>`I have already summoned my own doctor,' Ahlid said. `But I know the signs of the <br>
plague well. All of us in Arachnis know it, for plague is entwined throughout our lives.' <br>
`That is quite incredible,' said the fat man. <br>`Why would I deceive you?' Ahlid said. `I tell you this because I am sure of it. Must you <br>
waste your valuable time denying it?' <br>
The fat man sat silently for a long time. Then he said, dully, `I knew when I came <br>
ashore here that I was seriously ill. Ahlid, how long do I have?' <br>
`Perhaps three weeks, perhaps a month, even two.' <br>
`No more than that?' <br>`No more.' <br>`I see,' said the fat man. `Well, then... Is there a hospital here?' <br>
`None worthy of the name. You will stay here with me.' <br>`Out of the question,' said the fat man. `The risk of contagion...' <br>
`No one escapes contagion in Arachnis,' Ahlid said. `Listen to me: you have come <br>
home to live a little while and then die. This is your home, I am your family.' <br>
The fat man smiled vaguely and shook his head. <br>`You do not understand,' Ahlid said. `Death is a part of life. Therefore, there can be no <br>
rejection of it. What cannot be rejected must be accepted. What we cannot overcome we <br>must submit to. And since we are men, our submission must be as strong as our <br>rejection. You are very fortunate that you have been granted this chance to prepare <br>
yourself for Death and to do so here, in a cool and pleasant house--in your own house. It <br>is not a bad thing.' <br>
`No, it is not,' said the fat man. `But it will be a depressing time for you.' <br>`Your death will not depress me any more than will my own,' said Ahlid. `You and I will <br>
talk together in the days ahead. You will make your preparations. And you will help me.' <br>
`How?' <br>
`My acceptance of my own death is still very imperfect,' said Ahlid. `Through you, I <br>
hope to learn what you must learn: how to submit strongly.' <br>
`And your daughter?' <br>
`The thread of her life is slender. Surely, you have noticed that? She also must learn.' <br>`Very well,' the fat man said. `It is all very strange, and yet it is not strange at all... I <br>
am at the moment less startled by the imminence of my death than by the fact that you <br>have become a philosopher.' <br>
Ahlid shook his head. `I am a worldly man and a frightened man. But I am a man. I <br>
will look at what is in front of me.' <br>
`And I, too,' said the fat man, `It has taken us many years to pay attention to what is <br>
important.' <br>
`That is not strange at all,' Ahlid said. `If all men paid due attention to the great and <br>
important questions who would be left to make iced sherbet?' <br>
`You are right again,' said the fat man. `Now I would like to lie down for a while. Then <br>
we will talk more.' <br>
Ahlid rang a bell. `The servant and I will assist you to your bedroom. The doctor will be <br>
here before you awaken. He cannot cure you, but he can ease pain. Do you wish me to <br>do anything about the business you were talking about?' <br>
`No,' said the fat man. `I don't care about that any more.' <br>`Then  we  will  speak  of  it  no  more.  In  one  way  or  another,  business  matters  always <br>
seem to solve themselves.' <br>
The servant came, and the fat man was helped to a cool white bedroom. He realized <br>
that he was happy. Truly, nothing upon the earth could be predicted. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>74. All Alone and Feeling Blue <br>
 <br>Mishkin sat at his desk at the foot of the glass mountain that lay just beyond the great <br>
forest of Harmonia. He drank his morning coffee. The robot brought in the day's mail. <br>
 <br>First there was an official government notice concerning the undeliverability of Engine <br>
Part  L-1223A.  Five  reasons  were  listed.  Mishkin  didn't  bother  to  read  them.  The <br>
government notice was mimeographed. <br>
 <br>


<A name=58></a> <br>Next, there was a letter from Uncle Arnold: <br>
 <br>Dear Tom, You should only know the things I've done and the wires I've pulled, but <br>
nothing works, I just can't seem to get that engine part to you. I haven't given up hope, <br>however. (Your Uncle Arnie never gives up hope!) Maybe you didn't know that your <br>
second nephew, Irving Gluckman, is a consulting accountant for a branch of the Rand <br>Corporation. I'm going to ask him to ask his boss if they'll take on your problem as a <br>
matter of affecting the National Interest, which, in a way, it is. All of this may take a little <br>time, so if you can get home in any other way it might be a good idea to do just that. <br>Keep your chin up, and my best regards to your robot. <br>
 <br>Finally, there was a letter from The Man of a Thousand Disguises: <br>
 <br>Dear Tom, I've tried everything in my power, and quite a few things beyond my <br>
power, to send you that engine part and get you out of this unfortunate mess, which I <br>take full responsibility for getting you into. I even went so far as to construct an entire <br>
new sequence, with impeccable supporting logic and character relationships, all for the <br>sole purpose of delivering the engine part to you. But my main (new) character caught <br>the plague, lost all interest in life, and summarily refused to complete the job I had <br>
created him for. I tried to get his two helpers to do it, but they had fallen in love and <br>gone off to the Seychelles Islands to make jewellery and live on organic foods. So I spent <br>
a hell of a lot of time and wordage to no purpose whatsoever, and I really am sorry, but <br>that was my last bright idea, and now my doctor tells me that I must take a rest. <br>
Tom, forgive me, my nerves are shot, I'm broke, and there's simply nothing more I <br>
can do for you. I can't tell you how sorry I am that it has all worked out this way, <br>
especially since you've been so helpful and patient right from the beginning. <br>
I am enclosing under separate cover a box of Hershey bars with almonds, a tortilla <br>
press, and a manuscript copy of my newest book, entitled <i>How to Survive on an Alien </i><br>
<i>Planet.  </i>According to impartial readers, this is a well-researched and hiply written <br>examination of problems very similar to yours and contains many practical hints and <br>
suggestions. Stay well, old buddy, keep the old flag flying and all that  sort  of  thing.  If <br>anything turns up I'll act immediately, but you really shouldn't count on it. <br>
All the best � <br>The Author <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>75. Black Moment <br>
 <br>Ah, the loneliness of it all! The abandonment! The pain! Quick, Watson, the needle, <br>
the pill, the joint, the pellet! Too many stars, too many stares. Disembody. But first eat <br>the nice cream cheese and jelly sandwich. <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>76. Final Transformation <br>
 <br>`Tommy! Stop playing now!' <br>
`I'm not playing, Mom. This is <i>real.'</i> <br>`I know. But you have to stop playing now and come home.' <br>
Mishkin laughed bitterly. `I can't <i>get </i>home, that's the whole problem. I need a part for <br>
my spaceship...' <br>
`I <i>told </i>you to stop playing. Put down that broom and come into the house at once.' <br>`It's not a broom, it's a spaceship. Anyhow, my robot says...' <br>
`And bring that old radio in with you. Come in right now and eat your dinner.' <br>`Right <i>now, </i>Mom? Can't I play a little longer?' <br>`It's almost dark, and you have homework to do. Come inside right now.' <br>
`Aw...' <br>`And kindly do not sulk.' <br>
`All right. But <i>really, </i>it is a spaceship, and it is broken.' <br>
 <br>


<A name=59></a>`All right, it's a broken spaceship. Are you coming in?' <br>`Yes, Mom, I'm coming in right now.' <br>
<b> <br> <br></b>77. Final Deformations <br>
 <br>The Man of a Thousand Disguises turns into Mishkin. The robot changes into Uncle <br>
Arnold, who turns into Orchidius, who changes into the fat man, who turns into the <br>
robot, who changes into The Man of a Thousand Disguises, who changes into Mishkin, <br>who changes... coalesces, combines. <br>
 <br>There will be a short intermission while the appearances reindividualize themselves. <br>
Music of the spheres will be played. Refreshments will be served. Insights will be <br>
projected by the Illusion Machine. Smoking is permitted. <br>
 <br>FINAL EXHIBIT <br>A photograph of the 2nd battalion of the 32nd infantry regiment, 7th division, 8th <br>
Army. It is a long photograph, a scroll, a souvenir. Unroll it carefully. How much alike the <br>faces are! But look--Mishkin is in the fourth row from the bottom, third face from the left. <br>He has a silly smirk on his face. He is in no way remarkable. <br>
