<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>CHAPTER 1 </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin Flynn read the following advertisement in the classified section of the <br><i>Stanhope Gazette</i>: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:118"><nobr><span class="ft2">Gentleman from Mars, age 43, quiet, studious, cultured, wishes to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">exchange bodies with similarly inclined Earth gentleman. August 1 - <br>September 1. References exchanged. Brokers protected. <br> <br>This commonplace announcement was enough to set Flynn's pulse racing. To </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">swap bodies with a Martian ... It was an exciting idea, but also a repellent one. <br>After all, no one would want some sand-grubbing old Martian inside his head, <br>moving his arms and legs, looking out of his eyes and listening with his ears. <br>But in return for this unpleasantness, he, Marvin Flynn, would be able to see <br>Mars. And he would be able to see it as it should be seen: through the senses of <br>a native. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">As some wish to collect paintings, others books, others women, so Marvin </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Flynn wanted to acquire the substance of them all through travel. But this, his <br>ruling passion, was sadly unfulfilled. He had been born and raised in Stanhope, <br>New York. Physically, his town was some three hundred miles from New York <br>City. But spiritually and emotionally, the two cities were about a hundred years <br>apart. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Stanhope was a pleasing rural community situated in the foothills of the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Adirondacks, garlanded with orchards and dotted with clusters of brown cows <br>against rolling green pastureland. Invincibly bucolic, Stanhope clung to antique <br>ways; amiably, but with a hint of pugnacity. the town kept its distance from the </span></nobr></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">flinthearted megalopolis to the south. The IRT - 7th Avenue subway had <br>burrowed upstate as far as Kingston, but no farther. Gigantic freeways twisted <br>their concrete tentacles over the countryside, but could not take over Stanhope's <br>elm-lined Main Street. Other communities maintained a blast pit; Stanhope <br>clung to its antiquated jet field and was content with triweekly service. (Often at <br>night, Marvin had lain in bed and listened to that poignant sound of a vanishing <br>rural America, the lonely wail of a jetliner.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Stanhope was satisfied with itself, and the rest of the world seemed quite </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">satisfied with Stanhope and willing to leave it to its romantic dream of a less <br>hurried age. The only person whom the arrangement did not suit was Marvin <br>Flynn. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He had gone on the usual tours and had seen the usual things. Like everyone </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">else, he had spent many weekends in the capitals of Europe. And he had <br>explored the sunken city of Miami by scuba, gazed at the Hanging Gardens of <br>London, and had worshipped in the Bahai temple in Haifa. For his longer <br>vacations, he had gone on a walking tour across Marie Byrd Land, explored the <br>lower Ituri Rain Forest, crossed Sinkiang by camel, and had even lived for <br>several weeks in Lhassa, the art capital of the world. In all of this, his actions <br>were typical of his age and station. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But these trips meant nothing to him; they were the usual tourist assortment, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the sort of things that any casual vacationer was likely to do. Instead of rejoicing <br>in what he had, Flynn complained of what was denied him. He wanted to <i>really</i> <br>travel, and that meant going extraterrestrial. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">It didn't seem so much to ask; and yet, he had never even been to the Moon. <br>In the final analysis, it was a matter of economics. Interstellar travel was </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">expensive; for the most part, it was confined to the rich, or to colonists and <br>administrators. It was simply out of the question for an average sort of fellow. <br>Unless, of course, he wished to avail himself of the advantages of Mindswap. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Flynn, with innate small-town conservatism, had avoided this logical but </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">unsettling step. Until now. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin had tried to reconcile himself to his position in life, and to the very </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">acceptable possibilities that that position offered him. After all, he was free, gay, <br>and thirty-one (a little over thirty-one, actually). He was personable, a tall, <br>broad-shouldered boy with a clipped black moustache and gentle brown eyes. <br>He was healthy, intelligent, a good mixer, and not unacceptable to the other sex. <br>He had received the usual education: grade school, high school, twelve years of <br>college, and four years of postgraduate work. He was well trained for his job <br>with the Reyck-Peters Corporation. There he fluoroscoped plastic toys, <br>subjecting them to stress analysis and examining them for microshrinkage, <br>porosity, texture fatigue, and the like. Perhaps it wasn't the most important job in <br>the world; but then, we can't all be kings or spaceship pilots. It was certainly a <br>responsible position, especially when one considers the importance of toys in <br>this world, and the vital task of alleviating the frustrations of children. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin knew all this; and yet, he was unsatisfied. In vain he had gone to his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">neighbourhood Counsellor. This kindly man had tried to help Marvin through <br>Situation Factor Analysis, but Marvin had not responded with insight. He <br>wanted to <i>travel</i>, he refused to look honestly at the hidden implications of that <br>desire, and he would not accept any substitutes. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And now, reading that mundane yet thrilling advertisement similar to a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">thousand others yet unique in its particularity (since <i>he</i> was at the moment <br>reading it), Marvin felt a strange sensation in his throat. To swap bodies with a <br>Martian ... to see Mars, to visit the Burrow of the Sand King, to travel through <br>the aural splendour of The Wound, to listen to the chromatic sands of the Great <br>Dry Sea ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He had dreamed before. But this time was different. That strange sensation in </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">his throat argued a decision in the forming. Marvin wisely did not try to force it. <br>Instead, he put on his beanie and went downtown to the Stanhope Pharmacy. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br> <br> <br> <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>CHAPTER 2 </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">As he had expected, his best friend, Billy Hake, was at the soda fountain, sitting <br>on a stool and drinking a mild hallucinogen known as an LSD frappÃ©. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'How's the morn, Sorn?' Hake asked, in the slang popular at that time. <br>'Soft and mazy, Esterhazy,' Marvin replied, giving the obligatory response. <br>'Du koomen ta de la klipje?' Billy asked. (Pidgin Spanish-Afrikaans dialect </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">was the new laugh sensation that year.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Ja, Mijnheer,' Marvin answered, a little heavily. His heart simply was not in </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the clever repartee. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Billy caught the nuance of dissatisfaction. He raised a quizzical eyebrow, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">folded his copy of James Joyce Comics, popped a Keen-Smoke into his mouth, <br>bit down to release the fragrant green vapour, and asked, 'For-why you burrow?' <br>The question was wryly phrased but obviously well intended. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin sat down beside Billy. Heavyhearted, yet unwilling to reveal his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">unhappiness to his lighthearted friend, he held up both hands and proceeded to <br>speak in Plains Indian Sign Language. (Many intellectually inclined young men <br>were still under the influence of last year's sensational Projectoscope production <br>of <i>Dakota Dialogue</i>, starring Bjorn Rakradish as Crazy Horse and Milovar <br>Slavovivowitz as Red Cloud, and done entirely in gesture.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin made the gestures, mocking yet serious, for heart-that-breaks, horse-</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">that-wanders, sun-that-will-not-shine, moon-that-cannot rise. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He was interrupted by Mr Bigelow, proprietor of the Stanhope Pharmacy. Mr </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Bigelow was a middle-aged man of seventy-four, slightly balding, with a small <br>but evident paunch. Yet he affected boys' ways. Now he said to Marvin. 'Eh, <br>Mijnheer, querenzie tomar la klopje inmensa de la cabeza vefrouvens in forma <br>de ein skoboldash sundae?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">It was typical of Mr Bigelow and others of his generation to overdo the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">youthful slang, thus losing any comic effect except the pathetically <br>unintentional. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Schnell,' Marvin said, putting him down with the thoughtless cruelty of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">youth. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well, I never,' said Mr Bigelow, and moved huffily away with the mincing </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">step he had learned from the <i>Imitation of Life</i> show. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Billy perceived his friend's pain. It embarrassed him. He was thirty-four, a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">year and a bit older than Marvin, nearly a man. He had a good job as foreman of <br>Assembly Line 23 in Peterson's Box Factory. He clung to adolescent ways, of <br>course, but he knew that his age presented him with certain obligations. Thus, he <br>cross-circuited his fear of embarrassment, and spoke to his oldest friend in clear. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Marvin - what's the matter?' <br>Marvin shrugged his shoulder, quirked his mouth, and drummed aimlessly </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">with his fingers. He said, 'Oiga, hombre, ein Kleinnachtmusik es demasiado, <br>nicht wahr? The Todt you ruve to touch . . .' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Straighten it,' Billy said, with a quiet dignity beyond his years. <br>'I'm sorry,' Marvin said, in clear. 'It's just - oh, Billy, I really do want to travel </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">so badly!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Billy nodded. He was aware of his friend's obsession. 'Sure,' he said. 'Me </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">too.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But not as bad. Billy - I got the burns.' <br>His skoboldash sundae arrived. Marvin ignored it, and poured out his heart to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">his lifelong friend, 'Mira, Billy, it's really got me wound tighter than a plastic <br>retriever coil. I think of Mars and Venus, and really <i>faraway</i> places like <br>Aldeberan and Antares and - I mean, gosh, I just can't stop thinking about it all. <br>Like the Talking Ocean of Procyon IV, and the tripartritate hominoids of Allua <br>II, and it's like I'll simply die if I don't really and actually see those places.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Sure,' his friend said. 'I'd like to see them, too.' <br>'No, you don't <i>understand</i>,' Marvin said. 'It's not just to see - it's - it's like - </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">it's worse than - I mean, I can't just <i>live</i> here in Stanhope the rest of my life even <br>though it's fun and I got a nice job and I'm dating some really guapa girls but <br>heck, I can't just marry some <i>girl</i> and raise kids and - and - there's gotta be <br>something more!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Then Marvin lapsed into adolescent incoherence. But something of his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">feelings had come through the wild torrent of his words, and his friend nodded <br>sagely. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Marvin,' he said softly, 'I read you five by five, honest to Sam I do. But gee, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">even interplanetary travel costs <i>fortunes</i>. And interstellar stuff is just plain <br>impossible.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'It's all possible,' Marvin said, 'if you use Mindswap.' <br>'Marvin! You can't mean that!' His friend was too shocked to avoid the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">exclamation. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I can!' Marvin said. 'And by the Christo malherido, I'm going to!' <br>That shocked them both. Marvin hardly ever used bad language, and his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">friend could see the considerable stress he was under to use such an expression, <br>even though coded. And Marvin, having said what he had said, recognized the <br>implacable nature of his resolve. And having expressed it, he found it less <br>frightening to contemplate the next step, that of doing something about it. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But you <i>can't</i>,' Billy said. 'Mindswap is - well, it's dirty!' <br>' &quot;Dirty he who dirty thinks, CabrÃ³n.&quot; ' <br>'No, seriously. You don't want some sand-grubbing old Martian inside your </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">head? Moving your legs and arms, looking out of your eyes, <i>touching</i> you, and <br>maybe even--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin cut him off before he said something really bad. 'Mira,' he said, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'recuerda que I'll be in <i>his</i> body, on Mars, so he'll be having the same <br>embarrassments.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Martians haven't got no sense of embarrassment,' Billy said. <br>'That's just not true,' Marvin said. Although younger, he was in many ways </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">more mature than his friend. He had been an apt student in Comparative <br>Interstellar Ethics. And his intense desire to travel rendered him less provincial <br>in his attitudes, more prepared to see the other creature's point of view, than his <br>friend. From the age of twelve, when he had learned how to read, Marvin had <br>studied the manners and modes of many different races in the galaxy. Always he <br>had endeavoured to view those creatures through their own eyes, and to <br>understand their motivations in terms of their own unique psychologies. <br>Furthermore, he had scored in the 95th percentile in Projective Empathy, thus <br>establishing his raw potentiality for successful extraterrestrial relationships. In a <br>word, he was as prepared for travel as it is possible for a young man to become <br>who has lived all his life in a small town in the hinterlands of Earth. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">That afternoon, alone in his attic room, Marvin opened his encyclopedia. It had <br>been his companion and friend ever since his parents bought it for him when he <br>was nine. Now he set the comprehension level at 'simple', the scan rate at 'rapid', <br>punched his questions, and settled back as the little red and green lights flashed <br>on. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Hi, fellows,' the tapecorder said in its fruitily enthusiastic voice. 'Today - </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">let's talk about Mindswap!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There followed a historical section, which Marvin ignored. His attention </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">returned when he heard the tapecorder saying: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>

<!-- Page 6 -->

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'So let's just consider Mind as a kinda electroform or maybe even a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">subelectroform entity. You pro'lly remember from our previous talk that Mind is <br>thought to have begun as a projection of our bodily processes, and to have <br>evolved into a quasi-independent entity. You know what that means, fellas. It <br>means it's like you got a little Man in your head - but not quite. Isn't that <i>quazi</i>?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">The tapecorder laughed modestly at its little joke, then went on: <br>'So what have we got out of this mishmash? Well, kids, we got ourselves a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">sort of symbiotic situation, mind and bodywise, even though Mr Mind is <br>inclined to a sort of parasitism. But still, each can exist - theoretically - without <br>the other. Or anyhow, that's what the Big Thinkers say.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin skimmed. <br>'Now as for projecting the mind - well, guys, just think of throwing a ball ... <br>'Mental into physical, and vice versa. Ultimately, they are forms of each </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">other, just like matter and energy. Of course, we have yet to discover ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'But of course, we have only a pragmatic knowledge of it. We might </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">consider, just for a very brief moment, Van Voorhes' concept of Agglutinative <br>Reform, and the Lagos University Theory of Relative Absolutes. Of course, <br>these theories raise more questions than they answer ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'. . . and the whole works is made possible only by the somewhat surprising </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">lack of an immuniform reaction. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'The actual practice of Mindswap utilizes mechanical-hypnotic techniques </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">such as induced relaxation, pinpoint fixation, and the use of a mind-positive <br>substance, such as Williamite, as a narrow-beam focuser and intensifier. <br>Feedback programming ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Once learned, of course, you can Swap without mechanical aids, usually </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">employing sight as focus . . . ' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin turned off the encyclopedia and thought about space, and the many </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">planets, and the exotic inhabitants of those planets. He thought about Mindswap. <br>He thought: tomorrow I could be on Mars. Tomorrow I could be a Martian ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He jumped to his feet 'By jingo!' he cried, striking palm of his left hand with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">his right fist, 'I'll do it!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The strange alchemy of decision had transformed him. Without hesitation he </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">packed a light suitcase, left a note for his parents, and caught the jet to New <br>York. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">In New York, Marvin went directly to the body-brokerage house of Otis, <br>Blanders and Klent. He was sent to the office of Mr Blanders, a tall, athletic man <br>in the prime of life at sixty-three, and a full partner in the firm. He explained to <br>this man his purpose in coming. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Of course,' Mr Blanders said. 'You have reference to our advertisement of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Friday last. The Martian gentleman's name is Ze Kraggash, and he is very highly <br>recommended by the rectors of East Skern University.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What does he look like?' Marvin asked. <br>'See for yourself,' Blanders said. He showed Marvin a photograph of a being </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">with a barrel chest, thin legs, slightly thicker arms, and a small head with an <br>extremely long nose. The picture showed Kraggash standing knee-deep in mud, <br>waving to someone. Printed on the bottom of the photograph were the words: <br>'Souvenir of Mud Heaven - Mars' Year - Round Vacationland, highest moisture <br>content on the planet!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Nice-looking chap,' Mr Blanders commented. Marvin nodded, even though </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Kraggash looked just like any other Martian to him. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'His home,' Blanders continued, 'is in Wagomstamk, which is on the edge of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the Disappearing Desert in New South Mars. It is an extremely popular tourist <br>area, as you probably know. Like you, Mr Kraggash is desirous of travelling and <br>wishes to find a suitable host body. He has left the selection entirely up to us, <br>stipulating only mental and physical health.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well,' Marvin said, 'I don't mean to boast, but I've always been considered </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">healthy.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I can see that at a glance,' Mr Blanders said. 'It is only a feeling, of course, or </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">perhaps an intuition, but I have come to trust my feelings in thirty years of <br>dealing with the public. Purely on the basis of my feelings, I have rejected the <br>last three applicants for this particular Swap.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Mr Blanders seemed so proud of this that Marvin felt impelled to say, 'Have </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">you really?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Most certainly. You can have no conception of how frequently I must detect </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">and eliminate misfits in this line of work. Neurotics who seek ugly and illicit <br>thrills; criminals who wish to escape the purview of local law; the mentally <br>unstable, trying to escape their internal psychic pressures. And many more. I <br>cull them all.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I hope that I don't fit any of those categories,' Marvin said, with an </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">embarrassed little laugh. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I can tell at once that you do not,' Mr Blanders said. 'I would judge you as an </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">extremely normal young man, almost <i>excessively</i> normal, if that were possible. <br>You have been bitten by the travel bug, which is very suitable for your time of <br>life, and is a passion akin to failing in love, or fighting an idealistic war, or <br>becoming disillusioned with the world, and other postures of the young. It is <br>very fortunate that you had either the native wit or the good luck to come to us, <br>the oldest and most reliable brokerage house in the Swap business, rather than to </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">some of our less scrupulous competitors, or, worst of all, to the Open Market.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin knew very little about the Open Market; but he remained silent, not </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">wishing to betray his ignorance by asking. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Now then,' Mr Blanders said, 'we have certain formalities which we must go </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">through before we can gratify your request.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Formalities?' Marvin asked. <br>'Most certainly. First, you must have a complete examination, which will </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">produce an operational judgement of your physical, mental, and moral standing. <br>This is quite necessary, since bodies are swapped on an equal basis. You would <br>be quite unhappy if you found yourself stuck in the corpus of a Martian <br>suffering from sandpest or tunnel syndrome. Just as he would be unhappy if he <br>found that you had rickets or paranoia. By the term of our charter, we must <br>attempt as complete a knowledge of the health and stability of the Swappers as <br>possible, and apprise them of any discrepancies between real and advertised <br>condition.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I see,' Marvin said. 'And what happens after that?' <br>'Next, you and the Martian Gentleman will both sign a Reciprocal Damage </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Clause. This states that any damage to your host body, whether by omission or <br>commission, and including Acts of God, will, one, be recompensed at the rate <br>established by interstellar convention, and, two, that such damage will be visited <br>reciprocally upon your own body in accordance with the <i>lex talionis</i>.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Huh?' Marvin said. <br>'Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,' Mr Blanders explained. 'It's really quite simple </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">enough. Suppose you, in the Martian corpus, break a leg on the last day of <br>Occupancy. You suffer the pain, to be sure, but not the subsequent <br>inconvenience, which you avoid by returning to your own undamaged body. But <br>this is not equitable. Why should you escape the consequences of your own <br>accident? Why should someone else suffer those consequences for you? So, in <br>the interests of justice, interstellar law requires that, upon reoccupying your own <br>body, your own leg be broken in as scientific and painless a manner as possible.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Even if the first broken leg was an accident?' <br>'<i>Especially</i> if it were an accident. We have found that the Reciprocal Damage </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Clause has cut down the number of such accidents quite considerably.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'This begins to sound sorta dangerous,' Marvin said. <br>'Any course of action contains an element of danger,' Mr Blanders said. 'But </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the risks involved in Swapping are statistically unimportant, assuming that you <br>stay out of the Twisted World.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I don't know very much about the Twisted World,' Marvin said. <br>'Nobody does,' Blanders said. 'That's why you're supposed to stay out of it. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">That's reasonable enough, isn't it?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I suppose so.' Marvin said. 'What else is there?' <br>'Nothing to speak of. Just paperwork, waivers of special rights and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">immunities, that sort of thing. And, of course, I must give you the standard </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">warning about metaphoric deformation.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'All right,' Marvin said. 'I'd like to hear it.' <br>'I just gave it,' Blanders said. 'But I'll give it again. Watch out for metaphoric </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">deformation.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I'd be glad to,' Marvin said, 'but I don't know what it is.' <br>'It's really quite simple,' Blanders said. 'You might consider it a form of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">situational insanity. You see, our ability to assimiliate the unusual is limited, and <br>these limits are quickly reached and surpassed when we travel to alien planets. <br>We experience too much novelty; it becomes unbearable, and the mind seeks <br>relief through the buffering process of analogizing. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Analogy assures us that <i>this</i> is like <i>that</i>; it forms a bridge between the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">accepted known and the unacceptable unknown. It attaches the one to the other, <br>imbuing the intolerable unknown with a desirable familiarity. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'However, under the continued and unremitting impact of the unknown, even </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the analogizing faculty can become distorted. Unable to handle the flood of data <br>by the normal process of conceptual analogizing, the subject becomes victim to <br><i>perceptual</i> analogizing. This state is what we call &quot;metaphoric deformation&quot;. <br>The process is also known as &quot;Panzaism&quot;. Does that make it clear?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'No,' Marvin said. 'Why is it called &quot;Panzaism&quot;?' <br>'The concept is self-explanatory,' Blanders said. 'Don Quijote thinks the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">windmill is a giant, whereas Panza thinks the giant is a windmill. Quijotism may <br>be defined as the perception of everyday things as rare entities. The reverse of <br>that is Panzaism, which is the perception of rare entities as everyday things.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Do you mean,' Marvin asked, 'that I might think I was looking at a cow, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">when actually it was an Altairian?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Precisely,' Blanders said. 'It's simple enough, once you apply yourself. Just </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">sign here and here and we will get on with the examinations.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There were many tests, and endless questions. Flynn was poked and probed, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">lights were flashed in his face, sudden noises were broadcast at him, and strange <br>smells assailed his nostrils. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He passed everything with flying colours. Some hours later he was taken to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the Transfer Room, and was seated in a chair that looked alarmingly like an old <br>electric chair. The technicians made obligatory jokes: 'When you wake up, you'll <br>feel like a new man.' Lights flashed at him, he was getting sleepy, sleepier, <br>sleepiest. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He was thrilled by the imminence of travel, but appalled by his ignorance of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the world beyond Stanhope. What was the Open Market, anyhow? Where was <br>the Twisted World located, and why was he supposed to avoid it? And finally, <br>how dangerous was metaphoric deformation, how often did it occur, and what <br>was the recovery rate? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Soon he would find the answers to these questions, as well as the answers to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">many others that he hadn't asked. The lights were hurting his eyes, and he closed <br>them for a moment. When he opened them again, everything had changed. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>CHAPTER 4 </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Despite a bipedal frame, the Martian is one of the strangest creatures in the <br>galaxy. Indeed, from a sensory viewpoint, the Kvees of Aldeberan, despite their <br>double brains and special-function limbs, are closer to us. Accordingly, it is a <br>disturbing thing to Swap directly and without initiation into the corpus of a <br>Martian. And yet, no amelioration is possible. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin Flynn found himself in a pleasantly furnished room. There was a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">single window; through it, he gazed with Martian eyes upon a Martian <br>landscape. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He closed his eyes, since he could register nothing except a dismaying </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">confusion. Despite innoculations, he was beset by the nausea-producing waves <br>of culture-shock, and he had to stand very still until it subsided. Then, <br>cautiously, he opened his eyes and looked again. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He perceived low, flat sand dunes, which were made up of a hundred or more </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">distinct hues of grey. A silvery-blue wind was running across the horizon, and <br>an ochre counter-wind seemed to be attacking it. The sky was red, and many <br>indescribable hues were visible in the infra-red scale. In everything, Flynn saw <br>spidery spectrum lines. Earth and sky presented him with a dozen separate <br>palettes, some complementary, more of them clashing. There was no harmony in <br>nature's colours on Mars; these were the colours of chaos. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin found a pair of glasses in his hand, and slipped them on. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Immediately, the roar and clash of colours was reduced to manageable <br>proportions. The numbness of shock receded, and he began to perceive other <br>things. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">First, a heavy booming in his ear, and a quick rattle beneath it, like the tattoo </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">of a snare drum. He looked around for the source of this noise, and saw nothing <br>except earth and sky. He listened more carefully, and found that the sounds were <br>coming from his own chest. They were his lungs and heart, sounds that all <br>Martians lived with. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Now Marvin was able to take stock of himself. He looked at his legs, which </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">were long and spindly. There was no knee joint; instead, the leg was pivoted at <br>the ankle, shin, midthigh, and upper thigh. He walked, and admired the fluid <br>motion of his movements. His arms were slightly thicker than his legs, and his <br>double-jointed hands had three fingers and two opposable thumbs. He could <br>bend and twist these in a surprising number of ways. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He was dressed in black shorts and a white jumper. His chest-prop was </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">folded neatly and covered with an embroidered leather case. He was amazed at <br>how natural it all seemed. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And yet, it was not surprising. The ability of intelligent creatures to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">accommodate to new environments was what made Mindswap possible. And the <br>Martian frame, despite certain striking morphological and sensory differences, <br>was easy to get used to, unlike some of nature's more perverse creations. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Flynn was musing on this when he heard a door open behind him. He turned </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">and saw a Martian standing in front of him, dressed in a government uniform of <br>green and grey stripes. The Martian had reversed his feet in greeting, and <br>Marvin quickly responded in kind. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">(One of the glories of Mindswap is 'automatic education'. Or, in the amusing </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">jargon of the trade: 'When you take over a house, you get the use of the <br>furnishings.' The furnishings, of course, are the use of primary available <br>knowledge in the host brain, knowledge such as language, customs, mores and <br>morals, general information about the area in which one lives, and so forth. This <br>is primary-environment information, general, impersonal, useful as a guide, but <br>not necessarily reliable. Personal memories, likes, dislikes are, with certain <br>exceptions, unavailable to the occupier, or available only at the cost of <br>considerable mental effort. Again, in this area there is what appears to be a type <br>of immunilogical reaction, which allows only a superficial degree of contact <br>between disparate entities. 'General knowledge' is usually exempt; but 'personal <br>knowledge', involving beliefs, prejudices, hopes and fears is sacrosanct.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Soft wind,' the Martian said, in the classic old-Martian greeting form. <br>'And cloudless sky,' Flynn replied. (To his annoyance, he found that his host </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">body had a slight lisp.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I am Meenglo Orichichich, of the Tourist Bureau. Welcome to Mars, Mr </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Flynn.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Thanks,' Flynn said. 'Awfully good to be here. It's my first Swap, you know.' <br>'Yes, I know.' Orichichich said. He spat on the floor - a sure sign of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">nervousness - and uncurled his thumbs. From the corridor there came a sound of <br>heavy voices. Orichichich said, 'Now then, concerning your stay on Mars--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I want to see the Burrow of the Sand King,' Flynn said. 'And, of course, the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Talking Ocean.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Both excellent choices,' the official said. 'But first there are one or two minor </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">formalities.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Formalities?' <br>'Nothing too difficult,' Orichichich said, his nose twisting to the left in the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Martian smile. 'Would you look over these papers and identify them, please?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Flynn took the proffered papers and scanned them. They were replicas of the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">forms he had signed on Earth. He read them through, and found that all the <br>information had been sent correctly. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'These are the papers I signed on Earth,' he said. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The noise from the corridor grew louder. Marvin could make out words: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Scalded egg-laying son of a frostbitten tree stump! Gravel-loving degenerate!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Those were very strong insults indeed. <br>Marvin raised his nose quizzically. The official hastily said, 'A </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">misunderstanding, a mix-up. One of those unfortunate occurrences which occur <br>even to the best run of government tourist services. But I am quite sure that we <br>can straighten it out in five gulps of a rapi, if not sooner. Permit me to ask you <br>if--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There was the sound of a scuffle in the corridor. Then a Martian burst into </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the room, with a Martian sub-official clinging to his arm and trying to stop him. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The Martian who had burst in was extremely old, as could be told by the faint </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">phosphorescence of his skin. His arms quivered as he pointed both of them at <br>Marvin Flynn. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'There!' he shouted. 'There it is, and by tree-stumps I want it now!' <br>Marvin said, 'Sir, I am not in the habit of being addressed as &quot;it&quot;.' <br>'I am not addressing you' the old Martian said. 'I do not know nor care who or </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">what you are. I am addressing the body which you are occupying, and which is <br>not yours.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What are you talking about?' Flynn asked. <br>'This gentleman,' the official said, 'claims that you are occupying a body </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">which belongs to him.' He spat twice on the floor. 'It is a mix-up, of course, and <br>we can straighten it out at once ...' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Mix-up!' howled the old Martian. 'It's an out-and-out fraud!' <br>'Sir,' Marvin said, with cold dignity, 'you are under a grave misapprehension; </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">either that, or you are engaging in this slander for reasons I cannot hope to <br>fathom. This body, sir, was legally and fairly rented by me.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Scaly-skinned toad!' the old man shouted. 'Let me at him!' He struggled with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">circumspection against the restraining grip of the guard. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Suddenly, an imposing figure dressed entirely in white appeared in the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">doorway. All within the room fell silent as their gaze fell upon the feared and <br>respected representative of the South Martian Desert Police. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Gentlemen,' the policeman said, 'there is no need for recriminations. We </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">shall proceed now to the police station, all of us. There, with the help of the <br>Fulszime telepath, we shall penetrate to the truth, and to the motivation behind <br>it.' The policeman paused impressively, stared full into each man's face, <br>swallowed saliva to show supreme calm, and said: 'This, I promise you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Without further ado the policeman, the official, the old man, and Marvin </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Flynn proceeded to the police station. They walked silently, and they shared a <br>common mood of apprehension. It is a truism throughout the civilized galaxy <br>that when you go to the police, your troubles really begin. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">At the police station, Marvin Flynn and the others were taken directly to the <br>dim, moist chamber where the Fulszime telepath lived. This tripedal entity, like <br>all of his fellows from the Fulszime Planet, possessed a telepathic sixth sense, <br>perhaps in compensation for the dimness of his other five. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'All right.' the Fulszime telepath said, when all were assembled before him. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Step forward, fellow, and tell me your story.' He pointed a finger sternly at the <br>policeman. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Sir!' the policeman said, straightening with embarrassment,'I happen to be </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the policeman.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'That is interesting,' the telepath said. 'But I fail to see what it has to do with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the question of your innocence or guilt., </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But I am not even accused of a crime,' the policeman said. <br>The telepath mused for a moment, then said, 'I think I understand ... It is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">these two who are accused. Is that it?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'It is,' the policeman said. <br>'My apologies. Your aura of guilt led me to an over-hasty identification.' <br>'Guilt?' the policeman said. 'Me?' He spoke calmly, but his skin was showing </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the typical orange striations of anxiety. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Yes, you,' the telepath said. 'You need not be surprised; grand larceny is the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">sort of thing about which most intelligent creatures feel guilty.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Now just a minute!' the policeman shouted. 'I haven't committed any grand </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">larceny!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The telepath closed his eyes and introspected. At last he said, 'That is correct. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">I meant to say that you <i>will</i> perform grand larceny.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Clairvoyance is not admissable as evidence in a court of law,' the policeman </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">stated. 'And furthermore, readings of the future are a direct violation of the law <br>of free will.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'This is true,' the telepath said. 'My apologies.' <br>'It's quite all right,' the policeman said. 'When will I perform this alleged </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">grand larceny?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'About six months hence,' the telepath said. <br>'And will I be arrested?' <br>'No. You will flee the planet, going to a place where there is no extradition </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">law.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Hmm, interesting,' the policeman said. 'Could you tell me if ... But we can </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">discuss this later. Now, you must hear the stories of these men, and judge their <br>innocence or guilt.' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The telepath looked at Marvin, shook a flipper at him, and said, 'You may </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">proceed.' Marvin told his story, beginning with his first reading of the <br>advertisement and leaving out nothing. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Thank you,' the telepath said, when he was through. 'And now, sir, your </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">story.' He turned to the old Martian, who cleared his throat, scratched his thorax, <br>spat once or twice, and then proceeded. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:248"><nobr><span class="ft2">AIGELER THRUS' STORY </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">I don't even know where to begin this thing, so I guess I'd better start with my <br>name, which is Aigeler Thrus, and my race, which is Nemucthian Adventist, and <br>my occupation, which is that I own and operate a clothing store on the planet <br>Achelses V. Well, it's a small business and not a very good business and my <br>store is located in Lambersa on the South Polar Cap, and I sell clothing all day <br>to immigrant Venusian labourers, who are big, green, hairy fellows, very <br>ignorant and very excitable and apt to fight, though I have no prejudices against <br>them. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">You get to be philosophical in my business, and maybe I'm not rich, but at </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">least I got my health (thank God), and my wife Allura is healthy too, except for <br>a mild case of tentacular fibrosis. And I got two grown sons, one of whom is a <br>doctor in Sidneport, and the other is a trainer of Klannts. And I also got one <br>daughter, who is married, so of course that means I got a son-in-law. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">This son-in-law of mine I have always distrusted, since he is a fancy dresser </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">and owns twenty pairs of chest-props, although his wife my daughter hasn't even <br>got a matched set of scratchers. But it can't be helped, she dug her burrow, now <br>she has to crawl in it. But still, when a man is so interested in clothes and fancy-<br>smelling joint lubricants and similar luxuries on the salary of a moisture <br>salesman (he calls himself a 'hydrosensory engineer') it mikes you wonder a <br>little. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And he's always trying to scratch up extra income on the side with various </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">foolish ventures, which I have to equip him for out of my hard-earned savings, <br>which I get by selling to these big green fellows. Like last year he got hold of <br>this novelty item, a backyard cloudmaker, and I told him, who would want it? <br>But my wife insisted that I help him out, and sure enough he went broke. And <br>then this year, he had another scheme, and this time it was iridescent synthetic <br>wool seconds from Vega II, a consignment of which he somehow found in <br>Heligoport and which he wanted me to buy. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">I said to him, 'Look, what do my customers these Venusian loudmouths </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">know about fancy dressing? They're lucky if they can afford a pair of twill shorts <br>and maybe a robe for holidays.' But my son-in-law has got an answer for <br>everything and he says to me, 'Look, Papa, have I or have I not made a study of <br>Venusian folkways and mores? The way I look at it, here are these people <br>straight out of the backwoods, and they've got this love of ritual and dance and </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft3"><i>bright colours</i>. So it's a natural, true or not?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Well, to make a short story even shorter, I get talked into this venture against </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">my better judgement. Naturally, I had to see those iridescent seconds myself, <br>because I wouldn't trust my son-in-law to judge a piece of lint. And that meant <br>travelling halfway across the galaxy to Heligoport in Mars. So I started making <br>the arrangements. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">No one wanted to Swap with me. I can't say I blame them, because nobody </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">comes on purpose to a planet like Achelses V, unless it's immigrant Venusians <br>who don't know any better. But I find this ad from this Martian, Ze Kraggash, <br>who wants to rent his body out on account of he's taking his mind into Cold <br>Storage for a protracted rest. It's damned expensive, but what can I do? I get a <br>little money back by renting my own body to a friend who had been a quarentz <br>hunter before he was bedridden by muscular dyscomyotosis. And I go down to <br>the Swap Bureau and get projected to Mars. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Well, imagine my sensations when it turns out there is no body waiting for </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">me! Everybody's running around trying to find out what happened to my host <br>body, and they even try to send me back to Achelses V; but they can't because <br>my friend has already left on a quarentz hunting expedition with my body. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Finally they get me a body from the Theresiendstadt Rent-a-Body people. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Twelve hours is the maximum they can allow me since they're all booked up for <br>short-term rentals through the summer. And it's a pretty decrepit old body, as <br>you can see for yourself, and damned expensive anyhow. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">So I go out and try to find out what had gone wrong, and what do I find but </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">this tourist from Earth walking around bold as brass in the body which I have <br>paid for, and which, according to my contract, I should be occupying at this very <br>moment. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">It is not only unfair, it is also extremely aggravating to my health. And that is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the entire story. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">The telepath retired to his chambers in order to ponder his decision. He returned <br>in less than an hour and spoke as follows: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Both of you did, in all good faith, rent, swap, or otherwise acquire, the same </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">body, viz, the corpus of Ze Kraggash. This body was offered by its owner, the <br>aforesaid Ze Kraggash, to each of you, and thus sale was consummated in direct <br>violation of all laws concerned. Ze Kraggash's action must be considered <br>criminal, both in execution and intent. This being the case, I have caused to be <br>sent to Earth a message, requesting the immediate arrest of the aforesaid Ze <br>Kraggash, and his detention in a place of custody until such time as his <br>extradition can be effected. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Both of you made your purchase in good faith, however, the prior, or earlier, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">sale, as shown in the contractual forms, was made by Mr Aigeler Thrus, who <br>takes precedence over Mr Marvin Flynn by a matter of thirty-eight hours. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Therefore Mr Thrus, as the First Buyer, is awarded custody of the Corpus; and <br>Mr Flynn is ordered to cease, and desist his unlawful occupancy, and to take <br>cognizance of the Dispossess Notice, which I hereby give him, and which must <br>be obeyed within six standard Greenwich hours.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The telepath handed Marvin a Dispossess Notice. Flynn accepted it sadly, yet </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">with resignation. 'I suppose,' he said, 'that I had better go back to my own body <br>on Earth.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'That,' the telepath said, 'would be your wisest choice. Unfortunately, it is not </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">possible at the moment.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Not possible? Why not?' <br>'Because,' the telepath said, 'according to the Earth authorities, whose </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">telepathic reply I have just received, your body, animated by the mind of Ze <br>Kraggash, is nowhere to be found. A preliminary investigation leads us to fear <br>that Ze Kraggash has fled the planet, taking with him your body and Mr <br>Aigeler's money.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">It took a while for it to sink in, but finally, Marvin Flynn realized the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">implications of what had been said. He was stranded on Mars in an alien body, <br>which he had to relinquish. In six hours, he would be a mind with no body at all <br>and with a poor chance of finding one. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Minds cannot exist without bodies. Marvin Flynn slowly and unwillingly </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">faced the imminence of his own death. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br> <br> <br> <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>CHAPTER 6 </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin did not give way to despair. He gave way instead to anger, which was a <br>much healthier emotion, though equally unproductive. Instead of making a fool <br>of himself by weeping in the court, he made a fool of himself by storming <br>through the corridors of the Federal Building, demanding either fair play or a <br>damned good substitute. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There was no restraining this impetuous young man. Quite in vain did several </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">lawyers point out to him that, if justice really existed, there would be no need for <br>law and lawmakers, and thus one of mankind's noblest conceptions would be <br>obliterated, and an entire occupational group would be thrown out of work. For <br>it is the essence of the law, they told him, that abuses and outrages should exist, <br>since these discrepancies served as proof and validation of the necessity of law, <br>and of justice itself. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">This lucid argument brought no peace to the frenzied Marvin, who gave </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">every appearance of a man unsusceptible to reason. The breath rasped and <br>rattled in his throat as he roared his contempt for the Justice machinery of Mars. <br>His behaviour was considered disgraceful and was tolerated only because he <br>was young and therefore not fully acculturated. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But rage brought him no results and did not even produce in him the healthy </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">sensations of catharsis. Several judicial clerks pointed this out to him and were <br>mercilessly snubbed for their efforts. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin remained unaware of the bad impression he was creating in the minds </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">of others, and after a while his anger spent itself, leaving as its residue a sullen <br>resentment. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">It was in this mood that he came to a door marked 'Bureau of Detection and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Apprehension, Interstellar Division'. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Aha!' Marvin muttered, and entered the office. <br>He found himself in a small room that looked like something out of the pages </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">of an old historical novel. Against the wall were dignified banks of old but <br>reliable electronic calculators. Near the door was an early-model thought-to-<br>print translator. The armchairs had the abrupt shape and pastel plastic upholstery <br>that we associate with a more leisurely era. The room lacked only a bulky solid-<br>state Moraeny to make it a perfect replica of a scene from the pages of Sheckley <br>or one of the other early poets of the Age of Transmission. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There was a middle-aged Martian seated in a chair throwing darts at a target </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">shaped like a woman's bottom. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He turned hastily when Marvin came in and said, 'It's about time. I was </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">expecting you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Were you really?' Marvin asked. <br>'Well, not really,' the Martian said. 'But I have found that it makes an </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">effective opening and tends to create an atmosphere of trust.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Then why do you ruin it by telling me?' <br>The Martian shrugged his shoulder and said, 'Look, no one's perfect. I'm just </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">an ordinary working detective. Urf Urdorf's the name. Sit down. I think we have <br>a lead on your missing fur coat.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What fur coat?' Marvin asked. <br>'Aren't you Madame Ripper de Lowe, the transvestite who was robbed last </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">night in the Red Sands Hotel?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Certainly not. I'm Marvin Flynn, and I lost my body.' <br>'Of course, of course,' Detective Urdorf said, nodding vigorously. 'Let's take </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">it point by point. Do you remember by any chance where you were when you <br>first noticed that your body was missing? Could any of your friends have taken <br>it as a joke? Or could you have merely misplaced it, or perhaps sent it on a <br>vacation?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I didn't really <i>lose</i> it,' Marvin said. 'Actually, it was stolen.' <br>'You should have said so in the first place,' Urdorf said. 'That tends to put the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">matter in a different light. I am only a detective; I have never claimed to be a </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I'm sorry,' Marvin said. <br>'I'm sorry, too,' Detective Urdorf said. 'About your body, I mean. It must have </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">been quite a nasty shock.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Yes, it was.' <br>'I can well understand how you feel.' <br>'Thank you,' Marvin said. <br>They sat in companionable silence for several minutes. Then Marvin said, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I beg your pardon?' the detective replied. <br>'I said, &quot;Well?&quot; ' <br>'Oh. I'm sorry, I'm afraid I didn't hear you the first time.' <br>'That's quite all right.' <br>'Thank you.' <br>'You're extremely welcome.' <br>There was another silence. Then Marvin said, 'Well?' once again, and Urdorf </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">said, 'I beg your pardon?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin said, 'I want it back.' <br>'What?' <br>'My body.' <br>'Your what? Oh yes, your body. Hmm, I dare say you do,' the detective said </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">with an appreciative smile. 'But of course, it isn't as easy as that, is it?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I wouldn't know,' Marvin said. <br>'No, I don't suppose you would,' Urdorf said. 'But I can assure you that it isn't </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">as easy as that.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I see,' Marvin said. <br>'I rather hoped you would,' Urdorf said, and lapsed into silence. <br>This silence lasted for approximately twenty-five seconds, give or take a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">second or two. At the end of that time Marvin's patience collapsed and he <br>shouted, 'Goddamn it are you going to do something about getting me back my <br>body or are you going to just sit there on your goddamned fat ass and talk <br>without saying anything?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Of course I am going to get you your body,' the detective said. 'Or, in any </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">case, I am going to try. And there is no reason for abuse. I am not, after all, <br>some machine filled with tabulated answers, I am an intelligent being just like <br>yourself, I have my own hopes and fears; and, more germane, I have my own <br>way of conducting an interview. This way may seem ineffectual to you, but I <br>have found it extremely useful.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Have you really?' asked Marvin, chastened. <br>'Why, yes, as a matter of fact I have,' the detective replied, his mild voice </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">showing no trace of rancour. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Another silence seemed about to begin, so Marvin asked, 'What sort of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">chance do you think I have - we have - for recovering my body?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'A most excellent chance,' Detective Urdorf replied. 'It is my firm belief that </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">we will find your body soon. In fact, I think I could go so far as to say that I am <br>certain of success. I base this not on a study of your particular case, about which <br>I know very little at present, but on a simple examination of the statistics <br>involved.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Do the statistics favour us?' Marvin asked. <br>'They most assuredly do. Consider: I am a trained detective, conversant with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">all the new methods and possessing a top efficiency rating of AA-A. Yet in spite <br>of this, during my five years with the force, I have never solved a case.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Not a single one?' <br>'Not a single one,' Urdorf said firmly. 'Interesting, isn't it?' <br>'Yes, I suppose it is,' Marvin said. 'But doesn't that mean--' <br>'It means,' the detective said, 'that one of the strangest runs of bad luck that I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">have ever heard of is statistically due to break.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin was nonplussed, which is an unusual sensation in a Martian body. He </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">said, 'But suppose your luck doesn't break?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'You must not be superstitious,' the detective replied. 'The probabilities are </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">there; even the most casual examination of the situation should convince you of <br>that. I have been unable to solve 158 cases in a row. You are my 159th. How <br>would you bet if you were a betting man?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I'd stay with the run,' Marvin said. <br>'So would I,' the detective admitted, with a self-deprecating smile. 'But we </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">would both be wrong, and would be betting on the basis of our emotions rather <br>than on the calculations of our intellect.' Urdorf looked at the ceiling dreamily. <br>'One hundred and fifty-eight failures! It's a fantastic record, an unbelievable <br>record, especially if you grant my incorruptability, good faith, and skill. One <br>hundred fifty-eight! A run like that simply has to break! I could probably sit here <br>in my office and do nothing, and the criminal would find his way to me. That's <br>how strong the probabilities are in my favour.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Yes, sir,' Marvin said politely. 'But I hope you won't test that particular </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">approach.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'No, no, of course not,' Urdorf said. 'It would be interesting, but some people </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">might not understand. No, I shall pursue your case actively, especially since it is <br>a sex crime, which is the sort of thing I am interested in.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I beg yotir pardon?' Marvin said. <br>'There is really no need to apologize,' the detective assured him. 'One should </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">not be embarrassed or guilty by reason of being the victim of a sex crime, even <br>though the deepest folk wisdom of many cultures attaches a stigma to being <br>such a victim, on the presumption of conscious or unconscious complicity.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'No, no, I wasn't apologizing,' Marvin said. 'I was merely--' <br>'I quite understand,' the detective said. 'But you mustn't be ashamed to tell me </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">all the bizarre and loathsome details. You must think of me as an impersonal <br>official function instead of as an intelligent being with sexual feeling and fears </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">and urges and quirks and desires of his own.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'What I was trying to tell you,' Marvin said, 'is that there is no sex crime </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">involved here.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'They all say that,' the detective mused. 'It is strange how the human mind is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">forever unwilling to accept the unacceptable.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Look,' Marvin said, if you would take the time to read over the facts of the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">case, you would see that it was a case of an outright swindle. Money and self-<br>perpetuation were the motives.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I am aware of that,' the detective said. 'And, were I unaware of the processes </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">of sublimation, we could leave it at that.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What possible motive could the criminal have had?' Marvin asked. <br>'His motive is obvious,' Urdorf said. 'It is a classic syndrome. You see, this </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">fellow was acting under a specific compulsion, for which we have a specific <br>technical term. He was driven to his deed in an advanced state of obsessive <br>projective narcissism.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I don't understand,' Marvin said. <br>'It is not the sort of thing which the layman is apt to encounter,' the detective </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">told him. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What does it mean?' <br>'Well, I can't go into the entire etiology, but essentially, the dynamics of the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">syndrome involve a displaced self-love. That is to say, the sufferer falls in love <br>with another, but not <i>as</i> other. Rather, he falls in love with the Other as Himself. <br>He projects himself into the persona of the Other, identifying himself with that <br>Other in all ways, and repudiating his actual self. And, should he be able to <br>possess that Other, through Mindswap or allied means, then that Other becomes <br>himself, for whom he then feels a perfectly normal self-love.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Do you mean,' Marvin asked, 'that this thief loved me?' <br>'Not at all! Or rather, he didn't love you as <i>you</i> - as a separate person. He </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">loved <i>himself</i> as you, and thus his neurosis forced him to <i>become</i> you in order <br>that he could love himself.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'And once he was me,' Marvin asked, 'he was then able to love himself?' <br>'Precisely! That particular phenomenon is known as the incrementation of the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">ego. Possession of the Other equals possession of the primordial Self; possession <br>becomes self-possession, obsessive projection is transformed into normative <br>introjection. Upon achievement of the neurotic goal there is an apparent <br>remission of symptoms, and the sufferer achieves a state of pseudonormalcy in <br>which his problem can be detected only inferentially. It is a very great tragedy, <br>of course.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'For the victim?' <br>'Well, yes, that certainly,' Urdorf said. 'But I was thinking of the patient. You </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">see, in his case two perfectly normal drives have been combined, or crossed, and <br>thus perverted. Self-love is normal and necessary, and so is the desire for <br>possession and transformation. But taken together, they are destructive of the </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">true self, which is supplanted by what we term the &quot;mirror-ego&quot;. The neurotic <br>conquest, you see, shuts the door to objective reality. Ironically enough, the <br>apparent integration of the self precludes any hope of real mental health.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'All right,' Marvin said, with resignation. 'Will this help us find the man who </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">stole my body?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'It will enable us to understand him,' the detective said. 'Knowledge is power; </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">we know at the very start that the man we seek is apt to act normal. This extends <br>our field of action and enables <i>us</i> to act <i>as if he were normal</i>, and thus to see the <br>full complement of modern investigative techniques. Being able to start from a <br>premise like that, or indeed from any premise, is a very real advantage, I can <br>assure you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'How soon can you begin?' Marvin asked. <br>'I have already begun,' the detective replied. 'I shall send for the court </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">records, of course, and all other documents pertaining to this matter, and I shall <br>contact all relevant planetary authorities for additional information. I will spare <br>no effort, and I will travel to the ends of the universe if necessary or desirable. I <br>shall solve this case!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I'm very glad you feel that way,' Marvin said. <br>'One hundred and fifty-eight cases without a break,' Urdorf mused. 'Have you </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">ever heard of such a run of bad luck? But it will end here. I mean to say, it can't <br>go on indefinitely, can it?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I don't suppose so.' <br>'I wish my superiors would take that view,' the detective said gloomily. 'I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">wish they'd stop calling me &quot;stumblebum&quot;. Words like that and sneers and lifted <br>eyebrows all tend to shake one's confidence. Luckily for me, I have an <br>implacable will and utter self-confidence. Or at least I did have through my first <br>ninety or so failures.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The detective brooded darkly for several moments, then said to Marvin: 'I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">will expect your complete and utter cooperation.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'You shall have it,' Marvin said. 'The only trouble is, I am to be dispossessed </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">of this body in less than six hours.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Damned awkward,' Urdorf said absentmindedly. He was obviously thinking </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">about his case, and only with difficulty did he turn his attention back to Marvin. <br>'Dispossessed, eh? I suppose you've made other arrangements. No? Well then, I <br>suppose you <i>will</i> make other arrangements.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I don't know what arrangements to make,' Marvin said gloomily. <br>'Well, you can't expert me to sort out your whole life for you,' the detective </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">snapped. 'I've been trained to do one job, and the fact that I've failed consistently <br>at it doesn't alter the fact that it <i>is</i> the job which I have been trained for. So you <br>must cope with this matter of finding a body for yourself. The stakes are very <br>high, you know.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I know,' Marvin said. 'Finding a body is life or death for me.' <br>'Well, yes, that too,' the detective said. 'But I was thinking of the case and of </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the detrimental effect your death would have upon it.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That's a hell of a thing to say,' Marvin said. <br>'I wasn't thinking of my own stake in the matter,' the detective said. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Obviously, I <i>do</i> have a stake. But more important than that is the concept of <br>Justice, and the belief in the possibility of goodness, upon which all theories of <br>evil must depend, and also the statistical theory of probabilities. All of these <br>vital concepts might be damaged by my 159th failure to solve a crime. And I <br>think you'll admit that these are somewhat larger issues than our petty lives.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'No, I won't admit it,' Marvin said. <br>'Well, no need to argue the matter,' the detective said, in a determinedly </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">cheerful voice. 'Find yourself another body somewhere; and above all, stay <br>alive! I want you to promise me that you'll really try your level best to stay <br>alive.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I promise,' Marvin said. <br>'And I shall proceed with your case, and I will contact you as soon as I have </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">anything to report.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'But how will you find me?' Marvin asked. 'I don't know what body I'll be in, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">or even what planet.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'You forget that I am a detective,' Urdorf said, smiling faintly. 'I may have </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">my troubles in finding criminals, but I have never experienced the slightest <br>difficulty in finding victims. I have a theory about that, which I will be pleased <br>to discuss with you whenever we both have the time. But for now, just <br>remember: wherever you are or whatever you turn into, I shall certainly locate <br>you. So keep your chin up, don't lose the old moxie, and above all, stay alive!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin agreed to stay alive, since he had planned on it anyhow. And he went </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">out into the street with his precious time flowing away, and still without a body. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">announcement soon. The case is reminiscent of the infamous 'Eddie Two-<br>Head' scandal of the early '90s, in which ... <br> <br>Marvin Flynn let the newspaper fall into the gutter. He watched as the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">flowing sand bore it away; the bitter ephemerality of the newsprint seemed a <br>paradigm of his own highly conditional existence. He stared at his hands; his <br>head drooped. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">' 'Ere now, 'ere now, what seems to be the trouble, eh, lad?' <br>Flynn looked up into the kindly blue-green face of an Erlan. <br>'I've got troubles,' Flynn said. <br>'Well then, let's hear 'em,' the Erlan said, folding himself down on the kerb </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">beside Flynn. Like all of his race, the Erlan combined a quick sympathy with <br>brusque manners. Erlans were known as a rough, witty people, much given to <br>cheerful banter and homely sayings. Great travellers and traders, the Erlans of <br>Erlan II were religiously required to travel <i>in corpore</i>. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin told his story, right up to the disconsolate moment of the forward-</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">surging <i>now</i>, the cruel and remorseless now, the hungry now, eating into his <br>little stock of minutes and seconds, pressing forward to the time when his six <br>hours would have elapsed, and bodyless, he would be cast into that unknown <br>galaxy that men call 'death'. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Garn!' the Erlan said. 'Not half sorry for yourself, are you?' <br>'You're damned right I'm sorry for myself,' Flynn said, with a flash of anger. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I'd be sorry for anyone who was going to die in six hours. Why shouldn't I be <br>sorry for myself?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Suit yourself, cock,' the Erlan said. 'Some might call it bad form and all the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">bumf, but me, I hold with the teachings of the Guajuoie, who said: &quot;Is it death <br>which snuffles near you? Strike it on the snout!&quot; ' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin respected all religions, and certainly had no prejudices against the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">widespread Antidescantine Rite. But he couldn't see how the Guajuoie's words <br>could help him, and he said so. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Buck up!' the Erlan said. 'Got yer brains and yer six hours, ain't yer?' <br>'Five hours.' <br>'Well then! Git up on your hind legs and show a little grit, eh, cobber? Won't </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">do yourself much good maundering around here like a bloody buggering old lag, <br>will you now?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I don't suppose I will, really,' Marvin said. 'And yet, what can I do? I have no </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">body, and hosts are expensive.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Too true. But did you ever fink of the Open Market? Eh?' <br>'But that's supposed to be dangerous,' Marvin said, and blushed at the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">absurdity of his statement. The Erlan grinned toughly. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Got the picture, eh, lad? But listen, it ain't so bad as you fink, long as you </span></nobr></DIV>

Good luck, kid.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Wait a moment!' Flynn cried, as the Erlan folded to his feet. 'What is your </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">friend's name?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'James Virtue McHonnery,' the Erlan said. 'He's a tough, hard-bitten, narrow-</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">minded little cuss, and overfond of looking upon the grape when it is red, and <br>inclined to be smitten by black rage when in his cups.

Rising to his feet, he proceeded, slowly at first, then with more <br>speed, towards the Quain, in the north-west corner of which lay the many stalls <br>and open booths of the Open Market. And his hopes, previously near entropy, <br>began now to pulse modestly yet firmly. And in the nearby gutter, tattered <br>newspapers flowed on a stream of sand towards the eternal and enigmatic desert. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">yet so reminiscent of certain dark bedtime stories. Hesitantly he advanced into <br>the tangled labyrinth of streets and alleys, or dead-ends and courtyards, that <br>made up the ancient Free Market Area. And as he walked, a dozen shouted <br>propositions assailed his aural receptors. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Harvesters wanted to harvest the crop on Drogheda! We supply you with a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">fully functional body, complete with telepathy! All found, fifty credits a month, <br><i>and</i> a complete list of Class C-3 pleasures! Special two-year contracts are now <br>being let. Come harvest the crop on beautiful Drogheda!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Serve in the Naigwin Army! Twenty NCO bodies currently on offer, plus a </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What's the pay?' a man asked the salesman. <br>'Your keep, plus one credit a month.' <br>The man sneered and turned away. <br>'<i>And</i>,' the barker proclaimed, 'unlimited sacking rights.' <br>'Well, that seems in order,' the man said grudgingly. 'But the Naigwins been </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">losing this war for a decade. High casualty rate, and not much corporeal <br>reclamation.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'We're changing all that,' the salesman said. 'You're an experienced </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">mercenary?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Correct,' the man said. 'The name is Sean Von Ardin, and I've been in just </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">about every major war around, plus a fair number of minor ones.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Last rank?' <br>'Jevaldher in the army of the Count of Ganymede,' Von Ardin said. 'But </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">before that I held the rank of Full Cthusis.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well, well,' the salesman said, seemingly impressed. 'Full Cthusis, eh? Got </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">papers to prove it? OK, tell you what I can do. I can offer you a position with the <br>Naigwins as Manatee Leader, Second Class.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Von Ardin frowned and calculated on his fingers. 'Let's see, Manatee Leader, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Second Class is the equivalent of a Cyclopian Demi-Vale, which is slightly <br>lower than an Anaxorean Banner King, and almost half a grade lower than a <br>Dorian Old Boy. Which means ... Hey, I'd lose an entire field grade if I joined <br>you!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Ah, but you didn't hear me out,' the salesman continued. 'You would hold </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">that rank for a period of twenty-five days, to prove Purity of Intent, which the <br>Naigwin political leaders are very big on. <i>Then</i> we would jump you three entire <br>grades to Melanoan Superios, which would offer you an excellent chance at <br>provisional Lance-Jumbaya, and maybe - I can't promise this, but I think I can <br>swing it unofficially - <i>maybe</i> I can get you appointed Sackmeister for the spoils <br>of Eridsvurg.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well,' Von Ardin said, impressed in spite of himself, 'that's a pretty decent </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">deal - if you can swing it.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Come into the store,' the salesman said. 'Let me make a phone call . . .' <br>Marvin walked on and listened to men of a dozen races arguing with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">salesmen of a dozen more. A hundred propositions were screamed in his ear. His <br>spirits were stirred and uplifted by the vitality of the place. And the propositions <br>he heard, though sometimes dismaying, were often intriguing: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Aphid-man wanted for the Senthis Swarm. Good pay, congenial friendships!' <br>'Rewrite man required to work on the <i>Dirty Book of Kavengii</i>! Must be able </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">to empathize with sexual premises of the Midridarian race!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Garden planners needed for Arcturus! Come and relax among the only </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">vegetable-sentients in the galaxy!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Expert manacler wanted for Vega IV! Opportunities also for semi-skilled </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">restrainers! Full prerogatives!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There were so many opportunities in the galaxy! It seemed to Marvin that his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">misfortune was perhaps a blessing in disguise. He had wanted to travel - but his <br>modesty had permitted him no more than the role of tourist. But how much <br>better, how much more gratifying it would be, to travel for a reason: to serve <br>with the armies of Naigwin, experience life as an aphid-man, learn what it meant <br>to be a manacler - even to do rewrites on the <i>Dirty Book of Kavengii.</i> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Directly ahead of him, he spotted a sign that read: 'James Virtue McHonnery, </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">none other than McHonnery himself. Silent and disdainful, scorning to spiel, the <br>little man stood with arms folded as Flynn walked up to the booth. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">They stood face to face, Flynn slack-jawed, McHonnery clam-mouthed. Several <br>seconds of silence ensued. Then McHonnery said: 'Look, kid, this ain't no <br>goddamned peep show and I ain't no goddamned freak. If you got something to <br>say, spit it out. Otherwise take a walk for yourself before I break your back.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin could see at once that this man was no fawning, honey-mouthed body </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">salesman. There was no hint of obsequiousness in that rasping voice, no trace of <br>ingratiation in that downturned mouth. Here was a man who said what he <br>wanted to say, and took no heed of the consequences. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I - I am a client,' Flynn said. <br>'Big deal,' McHonnery harshed. 'Am I supposed to turn handsprings or </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">something?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">His sardonic retort and blunt, inner-directed demeanour gave Flynn a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">sensation of confidence. He knew, of course, that appearances could be <br>deceiving; but no one had ever told him what to judge by instead of <br>appearances. He was inclined to trust this proud and bitter man. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I am going to be dispossessed of this body in a matter of hours,' Marvin </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">explained. 'Since my own body has been stolen, I am in desperate need of a <br>substitute. I have very little money, but I - I am quite willing and prepared to <br>work.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">McHonnery stared at him, and a sardonic grin twisted the man's tight lips. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Prepared to work, huh? Ain't that nice! And just what are you prepared to work <br><i>at</i>?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Why - anything.' <br>'Yeah? Can you operate a Montcalm metal lathe with light-sensitive </span></nobr></DIV>

Well, we got a jazz band on Potemkin II which needs a <br>stomach-horn man, and a restaurant near BoÃ¶tes which could use a short-order <br>cook, with working knowledge of Cthensis specialities.

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Flynn shook his head and mumbled, 'I don't know anything about any of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">those jobs, sir.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Somehow,' McHonnery said, 'that doesn't surprise me as much as you might </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">think. Is there anything you <i>can</i> do?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Well, in college I was studying--' <br>'Don't give me your goddamned life story! I'm interested in your trade, skill, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">talent, profession, ability, whatever you want to call it. What, specifically, can <br>you <i>do</i>?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well,' Marvin said, 'I guess when you put it that way, I can't do anything </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">much.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I know,' McHonnery said, sighing. 'You're unskilled; it's written all over you. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Kid, it may interest you to know that unskilled minds are common as dirt, <br>commoner. The market's glutted with them, the universe is crammed to <br>overflowing with them. It may interest you to know that there is nothing you can <br>do that a machine can't do better, faster, and a damn sight more cheerfully.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I'm sorry to hear that, sir.' Marvin said, sadly but with dignity. He turned to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">go. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Just a minute,' McHonnery said. 'I thought you wanted to work.' <br>'But you said--' <br>'I said you were unskilled, which you are. And I said that a machine can do </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">anything you can do better, faster, and more cheerfully, <i>but not more cheaply</i>.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Oh.' Marvin said. <br>'Yep, in the cheapness department, you still got an edge over the gadgets. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">And that's quite an achievement in this day and age. I have always considered it <br>one of the glories of mankind that, despite its best efforts, it has never <br>completely succeeded in rendering itself superfluous. You see, kid, our instincts <br>order us to multiply, while our intelligence commands us to conserve. We are <br>like a father who bears many sons, but contrives to dispossess all but the eldest. <br>We call instinct blind, but intelligence is equally so. Intelligence has its <br>passions, its loves and its hates; woe to the logician whose superbly rational <br>system does not rest upon a solid base of raw feeling. Lacking such a base, we <br>call that man - irrational!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I never knew that,' Marvin said. <br>'Well, hell, it's obvious enough,' McHonnery said. 'The aim of intelligence is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">to put the whole goddamned human race out of work. Luckily, it can never be <br>done. A man will outwork a machine any day in the week. In the brute-labour <br>department, there'll always be opportunities for the unwanted.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I suppose there's a certain comfort in that,' Flynn said doubtfully. 'And of </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Hey, how's that?' McHonnery said. 'You're a friend of the Squib?' <br>'You might say that,' Flynn said, thus avoiding an outright lie, since anyone </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">might say anything whether it was true or not. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'You should have told me that in the first place,' McHonnery said. 'Not that it </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">would have changed anything, since the facts are exactly as I have stated them. <br>But I'd have told you that there's no shame in being unskilled; hell, all of us have <br>to start out that way, don't we? If you do well on a Short-Shuffle contract, you'll <br>pick up skills in no time.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I hope so, sir,' Flynn said, growing cautious now that McHonnery had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">become affable. 'Do you have a job in mind for me?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'As a matter of fact, I do,' McHonnery said. 'It's a one-week Shuffle, which, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">even if you don't like it, you could do standing on your head. Not that you <br>should have to, since it's a pleasant and compatible job, combining mild outdoor <br>exercise with modest intellectual stimulation, all in a framework of good <br>working conditions, an enlightened management, and a congenial working <br>force.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'It sounds marvellous,' Flynn said. 'What's wrong with it?' <br>'Well, it's not the sort of job you can get rich at,' McHonnery said. 'In fact, the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">pay is lousy. But what the hell, you can't have everything. A week at this will <br>give you a chance to think things over, talk with your fellow workers, decide <br>upon a direction for yourself.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What is the job?' Marvin asked. <br>'The official job title is Ootheca Indagator, Second Class.' <br>'That sounds impressive.' <br>'Glad that you like it. It means that you hunt for eggs.' <br>'Eggs?' <br>'Eggs. Or to be more specific, you hunt for and, upon finding, collect the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">eggs of the rock ganzer. Think you can swing it?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well, I'd like to know a little more about the techniques utilized for the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">collecting, and also about job conditions, and--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He stopped because McHonnery was slowly, sadly shaking his head. 'You </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">can find that out when you get there. I ain't delivering no goddamned travelogue, <br>and you ain't deciding on no guided tour. Do you want the job or not?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Do you have anything else available?' <br>'No.' <br>'Then I'll take the job.' <br>'You've made a smart decision,' McHonnery said. He took a paper out of his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">pocket. 'Here is the standard government-approved contract, written in Kro-<br>Melden, which is the official language of the planet Melde II, wherein is <br>licensed the employing company. Can you read Kro-Melden?' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I beg your pardon?' Flynn asked. <br>'The last is just the standard invocation. Let me see, I think that about covers </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">it. You guarantee, of course, not to commit acts of sabotage, espionage, <br>irreverence, disobedience, etc, and to furthermore eschew and desist from the <br>practices of sexual perversion as defined in Hoffmeyer's <i>Standard Book of <br>Melden Perversions</i>. And you also guarantee not to initiate a war, or to take part <br>in a war on Melde if one is initiated, and to wash once every two days, and to <br>stay out of debt, and not to become an alcoholic or insane person, and various <br>other things to which no reasonable person could possibly object. And that about <br>sums it up. If you have any important questions, I'll endeavour to answer them <br>for you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Well,' Flynn said, 'about those things I'm supposed to guarantee--' <br>'That's unimportant,' McHonnery said. 'Do you want the job or not? A simple </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">yes or no will suffice.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin had his doubts, but, unfortunately, he didn't have any alternatives; </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">and this lack rendered his doubts extraneous to the situation. He thought <br>fleetingly of the detective, then he put that thought firmly aside.

Drops of water slid <br>painfully down and around the tangled foliage like exhausted runners of a maze, <br>coming to rest at last in the spongy and indifferent soil. Shadows mingled and <br>danced, faded and reappeared, called into spurious motion by two tired suns in a <br>mouldy green sky. Overhead, a desolate therengol whistled for his mate, and <br>heard in reply the quick ominous cough of a predatory kingspringer. And <br>through this dolorous woodland, so tantalizingly like Earth and yet so different, <br>Marvin Flynn moved in his unfamiliar Melden body, his eyes downcast, <br>searching for ganzer eggs but not knowing what they looked like. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">All had been haste. From the moment he arrived on Melde, he had barely had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">a chance to take stock of himself. No sooner was he bodified than someone was <br>barking orders in his ear. Flynn had just had time to look hastily over his four-<br>armed, four-legged body, give his tail a single experimental flick, and fold his <br>ears across his back; then he was herded into a work gang, given a barracks <br>number and a mess-hall location, and handed a jumper two sizes too big for him, <br>and shoes that fitted tolerably well except for the left front. He signed for and <br>was given the tools of his new trade; a large plastic bag, dark glasses, a compass, <br>a net, a pair of tongs, a heavy metal tripod, and a blaster. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He and his fellow workers were then assembled in ranks, and received a </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Flynn learned that his new home occupied an insignificant portion of space in </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the vicinity of Aldeberan. Melde (so named for its dominant race, the Meldens) <br>was a thoroughly second-rate world. Its climate was rated 'intolerable' on the <br>Hurlihan-Chanz Climatic Tolerance Scale; its natural-resource potentiality was <br>classified 'submarginal', and its aesthetic-resonance factor (unweighted) was <br>given as 'unprepossessing'. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Not the sort of place,' the manager said, 'that one would choose for a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">vacation, or indeed, for anything, except possibly the practice of extreme <br>mortification.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">His audience tittered uneasily. <br>'Nevertheless,' the manager continued, 'this unloved and unlovely place, this </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">solar misfortune, this cosmic mediocrity is home to its inhabitants, who consider <br>it the finest place in the universe.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The Meldens, with a fierce pride in their only tangible asset, had made the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">best of their bad bargain. With the plucky determination of the eternally <br>unlucky, they had farmed the edges of the rain forest and collected meagre low-<br>yield ores from the vast blazing deserts. Their dogged persistence would have <br>been inspiring had it not been so tedious; and their efforts might have been <br>considered a tribute to the vaunting spirit of life had they not invariably ended in <br>failure. Because, despite all their travail, the Meldens were able to achieve <br>nothing better than slow starvation in the present, and the promise of racial <br>degeneration and extinction in the future. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'This, then, is Melde,' said the manager. 'Or rather, this is <i>what Melde would </i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>be</i> were it not for one additional factor. That factor spells the difference between <br>success and failure. I refer, of course, to the presence of ganzer eggs. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Ganzer eggs!' the manager repeated. 'No other planet possesses them; no </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">other planet so desperately needs them. Ganzer eggs! No object in the known <br>universe so clearly epitomizes the quality of desirability. Ganzer eggs! Let us <br>consider them, if you will.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Ganzer eggs were the sole export of the planet Melde. And luckily for the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Meldens, the eggs were always in heavy use. On Orichades, ganzer eggs were <br>utilized as love-objects; on Opiuchus II, they were ground up and eaten as a <br>sovereign aphrodisiac; on Morichades, after consecration, they were worshipped <br>by the irrational K'tengi. Many other uses could be cited. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Thus, ganzer eggs were a vital natural resource, and the only one which the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Meldens possessed. With them, the Meldens could maintain a tolerable degree <br>of civilization. Without them, the race would surely perish. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">To acquire a ganzer egg, all one had to do was pick it up. But therein lay </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">certain difficulties, since the ganzers, not unnaturally, objected to this practice. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The ganzers were forest dwellers, remotely of lizard origin. They also were </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">destroyers, clever at concealment, wily and ferocious, and completely <br>untameable. These qualities rendered the collection of ganzer eggs extremely <br>perilous. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'It is a curious situation,' the manager pointed out, 'and not without its </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">paradoxical overtones, that the main source of life on Melde is also the main <br>cause of death. It is something for you all to think about as you begin your <br>workday. And so I say, take good care of yourselves, keep guarded at all times, <br>look before you leap, observe every precaution with your indentured lives, and <br>also with the costly bodies which have been entrusted to your keeping. But in <br>addition, remember that you must fulfill your norm, since every day's work <br>unfulfilled by so much as a single egg is penalized by the addition of an <br>additional week. Therefore, be careful, but not too careful, and be perseverant, <br>but not blindly so, and courageous, but not rash, and assiduous, but never <br>foolhardy. Follow these simple maxims and you will have no difficulty. Good <br>luck, boys!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin and his fellow workers were then formed into ranks and marched into </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the forest on the double. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Within an hour they reached their search area. Marvin Flynn took this <br>opportunity to ask the foreman for instructions. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Instructions?' the foreman asked. 'What kind of type instructions?' (He was </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">an Orinathian deportee with no language aptitude.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I mean,' Flynn said, 'what am I supposed to do?' <br>The foreman pondered the question and at length responded: 'You supposed </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">pick eggs of ganzer.' (Amusingly enough, he pronounced it 'guntser'.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I understand that,' Flynn said. 'But I mean to say, I don't even know what a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">ganzer eggs looks like.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Not to worry,' the foreman replied. 'You know when see no mistake, yes.' <br>'Yes, sir,' Marvin said. 'And when I find a ganzer egg, are there any special </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">rules for handling it? I mean to say, is breakage a problem, or--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'To handle,' the foreman said, 'you pick up egg, put in bag. You understand </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">this thing yes no?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Of course I do,' Marvin said. 'But also, I would like to know about daily </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">quota expectations. I mean to say, is there some sort of a quota system, or <br>perhaps an hourly breakdown? I mean, how does one know when one has <br>fulfilled his norm?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Ah!' said the foreman, a look of comprehension finally crossing his broad, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">good-natured face. 'Of finish is like this. You pick ganzer egg, put in bag, <br>check?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Check,' Marvin said instantly. <br>'You do so time after time <i>until bag is full</i>. Catch?' <br>'I believe I do,' Marvin said. 'The full bag represents the actual or ideal quota. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Let me just go over the steps again to make absolutely sure I've got it. First, I <br>locate the ganzer eggs, applying Terran associations to the concept, and <br>presumably having no difficulty in identification. Second, having located and <br>identified the desired object, I proceed to &quot;put it in my basket&quot;, by which I <br>assume that I lift it manually to initiate the transaction, and then proceed with <br>actions consonant with that beginning. Third, repeating this strategy <i>S</i> for an <i>x</i> <br>number of times, I perform the equation <i>Sx=B!</i>, when <i>B</i> represents the capacity <br>of the bag and <i>!</i> represents the sum of <i>x</i> transactions necessary to fulfill <i>B</i>. <br>Finally, the sum of all strategies completed, I return to the camp, where I turn in <br>the contents of my bag. Do I have it straight, sir?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The foreman tapped his teeth with his tail and said, 'You put me on, huh, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">kid?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Well, sir, I merely wished to ascertain--' <br>'You make big joke on old-planet Orinathian yokel, yah, sure, huh. You think </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">you so smart, but you ain't so smart. Remember - nobody likes wise guy.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I'm sorry,' Flynn said, swishing his tail deferentially. (But he wasn't sorry. It </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">was his first show of spirit since this downward-trending series of events had <br>begun for him, and he was glad to find himself capable of some show of spirit, <br>no matter how ill-timed or badly considered.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Anyhow, me I tink you catch elementary rudiments of job all right so you go </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">now perform work-labour <i>big</i>, and keep nose clean or I break six or more of <br>your limbs, dig?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Dig,' said Flynn, wheeled and cantered into the forest and there began his </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin Flynn wondered as he wandered just what a ganzer egg looked like. He <br>also would have enjoyed knowing what he was supposed to use his equipment <br>for; the sunglasses were useless in the dim recesses of the forest, and the heavy <br>tripod was incomprehensible. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He slid silently through the forest, his nostrils flared wide, his eyes extended </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">and swivelling, their blink-rate reduced. His golden hide, scented faintly with <br>appisthyme, twitched sensitively as his great muscles moved beneath it, <br>apparently relaxed yet poised for instant action. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The forest was a symphony of greens and greys, cut through with the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">occasional scarlet theme of a creeper, or the purple flourish of a lillibabba shrub, <br>or rarer still, the haunting oboe countermelody of an orange whip-whinger. Yet <br>withal, the effect was essentially a sombre and thought-provoking one, like the <br>sight of a vast amusement park in the silent hour before dawn. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But there! Right over there! A little to the left! Yes, yes, just beneath the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">boku tree! Is that ... ? Could it be ... ? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Flynn parted the leaves with his right arms and bent low. There, in a nest of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">grass and woven twigs, he saw a glittering ovoid that resembled nothing quite so <br>much as an ostrich egg encrusted with precious gems. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">The foreman had been right. There could be no mistaking a ganzer egg. <br>Gazing carefully upon that singular object, and taking stock of his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">impressions, Marvin could see the light of a million fairy fires burning bright in <br>the curved and multihued ganzer surface. Shadows drifted across it like the <br>fragrance of half-remembered dreams, twisting and turning like the descending <br>ghosts of phantoms. An emotion welled up in Marvin, of twilight and evensong, <br>of slow cattle grazing near a crystal brook, of dusty, heartbroken cypresses <br>beside a white stone road. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Although it wrenched his sensibilities to do so, Marvin bent down and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">reached out, with the straightforward intention of lifting the ganzer egg and <br>sequestering it within his plastic bag. His hand folded lovingly around the <br>glowing orb. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">He pulled his hand back quickly; the glowing orb was hotter than hell. <br>Marvin looked at the ganzer egg with new respect. Now he understood the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">purpose of the tongs with which he had been equipped. He manoeuvred them <br>into position and closed the jaws gently on the spheroid of dreams. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The spheroid of dreams bounced away from him like a rubber ball. Marvin </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">galloped after it, fumbling with his net. The ganzer egg twisted and ricocheted, <br>and bolted for thick underbrush. Marvin cast his net in desperation, and fortune <br>guided his hand. The ganzer egg was neatly netted. It lay quietly, pulsating as <br>though out of breath. Marvin approached it cautiously, ready for any trick. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Instead, the ganzer egg spoke. 'Look, mister,' it said, in a muffled voice. 'Just </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">what's eating you?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Beg pardon?' Marvin said. <br>'Look,' the ganzer egg said, 'I am sitting here in a public park minding my </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">own business when suddenly you come up and pounce on me like a lunatic, <br>bruising my shoulder and acting in general like some kind of nut. Well, <br>naturally, I get a little hot. Who wouldn't? So I decide to move away because it's <br>my day off and I don't want no trouble. So you up and throw a net around me <br>like I was a goddamned <i>fish</i> or a butterfly or something. So I just want to know, <br>what's the big idea?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Well,' Marvin said, 'you see, you're a ganzer egg.' <br>'I'm aware of that,' the ganzer egg said. 'Sure I'm a ganzer egg. Is there a law </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">against that all of a sudden?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Certainly not,' Marvin said. 'But as it happens, I am hunting ganzer eggs.' <br>There was a short silence. Then the ganzer egg said, 'Would you mind </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">repeating that?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin did. The ganzer egg said, 'Mmm, that's what I thought you said.' He </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">laughed feebly. 'You're kidding, aren't you?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Sorry, I'm not' <br>'Sure you are,' the ganzer egg said, a note of desperation in his voice, 'So OK, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">you've had your fun. Now let me out of here.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Sorry ...' <br>'<i>Let me out!</i>' <br>'I can't.' <br>'Why?' <br>'Because I'm hunting ganzer eggs.' <br>'My God,' the ganzer egg said, 'this is the craziest thing I've ever heard in my </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">life. You never met me before, did you? So why are you hunting me?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I've been hired to hunt ganzer eggs,' Marvin told him. <br>'Look, fella, are you trying to tell me that you just go around hunting any </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">ganzer egg at all? You don't care which one?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That's right.' <br>'And you aren't really looking for one <i>particular</i> ganzer egg who maybe did </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">you a bad turn?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'No, no,' Marvin said. 'I've never even met a ganzer egg before.' <br>'You've never ... and yet you hunt ... ? I must be going out of my mind, I can't </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">be hearing right. I mean, things like this just don't happen. I mean, it's like some <br>kind of an incredible nightmare ...

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin was embarrassed and exasperated, and he wished the ganzer egg </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">would shut up. He said gruflly, 'I'm not fooling. My job is to collect ganzer <br>eggs.' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That's all right,' Marvin said. 'Are you ready to be collected now?' <br>'I - I'm trying to get used to the idea. It's so ... so ... Look, could I ask you just </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">one question?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Hurry it up,' Marvin said. <br>'The thing I want to ask,' the ganzer egg said, 'do you get some kind of a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">charge out of this sort of thing? I mean are you some sort of pervert? I don't <br>mean to be insulting.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'That's all right,' Marvin said. 'No, I'm not a pervert, and I can assure you I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">take no pleasure in this. It's strictly a job with me.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Strictly a job,' the ganzer egg repeated. 'A <i>job</i>. To kidnap a ganzer egg whom </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">you've never met before. Just a job. Like picking up a stone. Only I'm not a <br>stone, I'm a ganzer egg!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I realize that,' Marvin said. 'Believe me. I'm finding all of this very strange.' <br>'<i>You're</i> finding it strange!' the ganzer egg said, his voice rising to a scream. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'How do you think I feel? Do you think maybe I think it's <i>natural</i> for someone to <br>come along like in a nightmare and <i>collect</i> me?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Steady,' Marvin said. <br>'Sorry,' the ganzer egg said. 'I'm all right now.' <br>'I'm really very sorry about this,' Marvin said. 'But you see, I've got this job </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">and this quota, and if I don't do it I'll have to spend the rest of my life here.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Crazy,' the ganzer egg whispered to himself. 'He's absolutely and completely </span></nobr></DIV>

I have always tried to be a good person, and although I am not a <br>regular churchgoer, You surely know that true religion is in the heart. I've <br>maybe done some bad things in my life, I won't deny it. But Lord, why this <br>punishment? Why me? Why not someone else, one of the real bad ones, one of <br>the criminals? Why me? And why like this? Something is <i>collecting</i> me like I'm <br>some sort of a <i>thing</i> ... And I don't understand. But I know that You are All-<br>Wise and All-Powerful, and I know that You are good, so I guess there must be <br>a reason ... even if I'm too stupid to see it. So look, God, if this is it, then OK, <br>this is it. But could you look after my wife and kids? And could you especially <br>look after the little one?' The ganzer egg's voice broke, but he recovered almost <br>at once. 'I ask especially for the little one, God, because he's lame and the other <br>kids pick on him and he needs a lot - a lot of love. Amen.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">The ganzer egg choked back his sobs. His voice became abruptly stronger. <br>'All right,' he said to Marvin. 'I'm ready now. Go ahead and do your </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">damnedest, you lousy son-of-a-bitch.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">But the prayer of the ganzer egg had umnanned Marvin completely. With eyes <br>wet and fetlocks trembling, Marvin opened the net and released his captive. The <br>ganzer egg rolled out a little distance and then stopped, clearly fearing a trick. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'You - you really mean this?' he said. <br>'I do,' Marvin said. 'I was never cut out for this kind of work. I don't know </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">what they will do to me back at the camp, but I shall never gather a single <br>ganzer egg!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Praised be the name of the Lord,' the ganzer egg said softly. 'I've seen a few </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">strange things in my time, but it seems to me that the Hand of Providence--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The hypothesis of the ganzer egg (known as the Interventionalist Fallacy) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">was interrupted by a sudden ominous crashing in the underbrush. Marvin <br>whirled, and remembered the dangers of the planet Melde. He had been warned, <br>but had forgotten. And now, desperately, he fumbled for his blaster, which had <br>become entangled in his net. Violently he wrenched at it, pulled it free, heard a <br>shrill warning from the ganzer egg-- </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And then he was flung violently to the ground. The blaster spun away into </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the underbrush. And Marvin gazed up into slit black eyes beneath a low <br>armoured forehead. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">No introductions were necessary. Flynn knew that he had met a full-grown </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">adult marauding ganzer, and had met him under possibly the worst of all <br>circumstances. The evidence (if evidence were needed) was all too evident; <br>close to hand was the damning net, the telltale sunglasses, the revealing tongs. <br>And closer still - closing on his neck - was the tooth-edged jaw of the gigantic <br>saurian, so close that Marvin could see three gold molars and a temporary <br>porcelain filling. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Flynn tried to wriggle free. The ganzer pressed him back with a paw the size </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">of a yak saddle; his cruel claws, each the size of a pair of ice tongs, bit cruelly <br>into Marvin's golden hide. The slavering jaws gaped hideously, descended, <br>about to engulf his entire head ... </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Suddenly - time stopped! Marvin saw the ganzer's jaws arrested in midslaver, <br>his bloodshot left eye fixed in midblink, and his entire great body gripped in a <br>strange and unyielding rigidity. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Nearby, the ganzer egg was as motionless as a carven replica of itself. <br>The breeze was stopped in midcareer. Trees were caught in straining </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">postures, and a meritheian hawk was fixated in midflight like a dummy attached <br>to a wire. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">The sun stopped its inexorable rolling flight! <br>And in this strange tableau, Marvin stared with tremulous sensations in the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">direction of a single movement in the air three feet above his head and slightly <br>to his left. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">It began as a whorl of dust, broadened, expanded, expatiated, thickening at </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the base and becoming convex at the apex. The rotation came faster, and the <br>figure solidified. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Detective Urdorf!' Marvin cried. For it was indeed the Martian detective </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">with the streak of bad luck who had promised to solve Marvin's case and to <br>return to him his rightful body. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Terribly sorry to barge in like this,' Urdorf said, materializing fully and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">falling heavily to the ground. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Thank God you have come!' Marvin said. 'You have saved me from an </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">extremely unpleasant fate, and now if you will help me out from under this <br>creature--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">For Marvin was still pinned to the ground by the ganzer's paw, which had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">taken on the rigidity of tempered steel, and from beneath which he was unable to <br>wriggle. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Sorry,' the detective said, getting up and dusting himself off. 'I'm afraid I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">can't do that.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Why not?' <br>'Because it's against the rules,' Detective Urdorf told him. 'You see, any </span></nobr></DIV>

Because of this, <br>any displacement is punishable by a prison sentence of one year and a fine of <br>one thousand credits.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Oh. I didn't know that,' Marvin said. <br>'Well, I'm afraid that's how it is,' the detective said. <br>'I see,' Marvin said. <br>'I rather hoped you would,' the detective said. <br>There was a long and uncomfortable silence. Then Marvin said, 'Well?' <br>'Beg pardon?' <br>'I said - I <i>meant</i> to say, why did you come here?' <br>'Oh,' the detective said. 'I wished to ask you several questions which had not </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">occurred to me earlier, and which would assist me in the rigorous investigation <br>and solution of this case.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Ask away,' Marvin said. <br>'Thank you. First and foremost, what is your favourite colour?' <br>'Blue.' <br>'But exactly what <i>shade</i> of blue? Please try to be exact.' <br>'Robin's-egg blue.' <br>'Hmmm.' The detective noted it down in his notebook. 'And now, tell me </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">quickly and without thinking, what is the first number that comes into your <br>mind?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'87792.3,' Marvin replied without hesitation. <br>'Um hum. And now, without reflection, tell me the name of the first popular </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">song you can think of.', </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">' &quot;Orang-Utan Rhapsody&quot;,' Marvin said. <br>'Ummmm. Fine,' Urdorf said, snapping his notebook shut. 'I think that covers </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">everything.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What was the purpose of those questions?' Marvin asked. <br>'With this information, I will be able to test various suspects for corpus-</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">vestigial responses. It is part of the Duulman self-identity quiz.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Oh,' Marvin said. 'Have you had any luck yet?' <br>'Luck hardly enters into it,' Urdorf replied. 'But I can say that the case is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">proceeding in a satisfactory manner. We traced the thief to Iorama II, where he <br>smuggled himself into a cargoload of flash-frozen beef destined for Goera <br>Major. On Goera he represented himself as a fugitive from Hage XI, which won <br>him a good deal of popular favour. He managed to raise enough money for fare <br>to Kvanthis, where he had cached his money. Staying no more than a day on <br>Kvanthis, he boarded the local to the Fiftystars Autonomous Region.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'And then?' Marvin asked. <br>'Then we lost track of him temporarily. Fiftystars Region contains no less </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">than 432 planetary systems with a combined population of 300 billion. So as you </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">can see, our work is cut out for us.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'It sounds hopeless,' Marvin said. <br>'Quite the contrary, it is a very good break for us. Laymen always mistake </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">complication for complexity. But our criminal will find no safety in mere <br>multiplicity, which is always susceptible to statistical analysis.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'So what happens now?' Marvin asked. <br>'We continue analysing, and then we make a projection based upon the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">probabilities, and then we send our projection across the galaxy and see if it <br>goes nova ... I am speaking figuratively, of course.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Of course,' Marvin said. 'Do you really think you'll catch him?' <br>'I am fully confident of the results,' Detective Urdorf said. 'But you must </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">have patience. You must remember that intergalactic crime is still a relatively <br>new field, and therefore intergalactic investigation is newer still. There have <br>been many crimes in which even the existence of a criminal could not be <br>proven, much less detected. So in some respects, we are ahead of the game.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I guess I'll have to take your word for it,' Marvin said. <br>'Just don't worry. In these cases, it is best for the victim to continue his life as </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">normally as possible, to stay alive, and not to give way to despair. I hope you <br>will remember this.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I'll try to,' Marvin said. 'But about this situation I'm in at present--' <br>'It is the very sort of situation I have told you to avoid,' the detective said </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">severely. 'Please remember that in the future, if you should manage to come out <br>of this alive. Good luck, my friend, and stay alive!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Before Marvin's eyes, Detective Urdorf revolved, faster, faster, grew </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">dimmer, and disappeared. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Time unfroze. <br>And Marvin gazed up again into the ganzer's slit black eyes and low </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">armoured forehead, and saw the hideous gaping jaws descending, about to <br>engulf his entire head ... </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What for?' the ganzer asked. <br>Marvin hadn't thought that far. He heard the ganzer egg muttering, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Turnabout's fair play; and yet, he was kind to me. Still, what business is it of <br>mine? Stick your neck out, somebody cracks your shell. And yet ...' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I don't want to die,' Marvin said. <br>'I didn't suppose you did,' the rock ganzer said, in a not unfriendly voice. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'And, of course, you want to discuss it with me. Ethics, morals, the whole bit. <br>But I'm afraid not. We were specifically warned, you see, never to allow a <br>Melden to talk. We were told to just do the job and get it over with, not to <br><i>personalize</i> it. Just do it and get on to the next bit of work. Mental hygiene, <br>really. Therefore, if you would close your eyes ...' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The jaws moved closer. But Marvin, filled with wild surmise, cried out: 'Did </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">you say <i>job</i>?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Of course, it's a job,' the ganzer said. 'There's nothing personal in it.' He </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">frowned, apparently annoyed at himself for having spoken. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'A job! Your job is to hunt Meldens, is that it?' <br>'Well, obviously. This planet of Ganzer isn't good for much, you see, except </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">for hunting Meldens.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But why do you hunt them?' Marvin asked. <br>'Well, for one thing, a ganzer egg can grow to full maturity only in the host </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">flesh of the adult Melden.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I <i>say</i>,' the ganzer egg said, rolling around with embarrassment, 'must we get </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">so damned <i>biological</i>? I mean to say, you don't hear me talking about <i>your</i> <br>natural functions, do you?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'And secondly,' the ganzer continued, 'our sole export is Melden hides, which </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">(after curing and tanning) are used for imperial vestments on Triana II, for good-<br>luck charms on Nemo, and for seat covers on Chrysler XXX. This quest for the <br>elusive and deadly Melden is our sole means of maintaining a tolerable degree <br>of civilization and--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'That's exactly what they told me!' Marvin cried, and quickly repeated what </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the manager had said to him. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'My gosh!' said the ganzer. <br>Both realized the true situation now: the Meldens were utterly dependent </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">upon the Ganzers, who in turn, were utterly dependent upon the Meldens. These <br>two races hunted each other, lived and died for each other, and, through <br>ignorance or guile, ignored any relationship between each other. The <br>relationship was utterly symbiotic, but completely unacknowledged by either <br>race. In fact, each race pretended that it alone was a Civilized Intelligence, and <br>that the other was bestial, contemptible, and of no account, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And it now occurred to both of them that they were, in equal measure, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">participants in the general concept of Humanity. (The ganzer egg was also a <br>part, of course.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The realization was awesome; but Marvin was still pinned to the ground by </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the ganzer's heavy paw. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'This leaves me in a somewhat embarrassing situation,' the ganzer said, after </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">a while. 'My natural tendency is to release you; but I am working on this planet <br>under a contract, which stipulates--' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Then you are not a real ganzer?' <br>'No. I am a Swapper like yourself, and I come from Terra!' <br>'My home planet!' Marvin cried. <br>'I had guessed as much,' the ganzer replied. 'After a time one becomes </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">sensitive to the idiosyncratic quality of differing minds, and learns to recognize <br>one's countrymen through little tricks of thought and phraseology. I would guess <br>that you are an American, probably from the East Coast, perhaps from <br>Connecticut or Vermont--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'New York State!' Marvin cried. 'I am from Stanhope!' <br>'And I am from Saranac Lake,' the ganzer said. 'My name is Otis Dagobert, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">and I am thirty-seven years old.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And with that, the ganzer lifted his paw from Marvin's chest. 'We are </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">neighbours,' he said quietly. 'And so I cannot kill you, just as I am reasonably <br>sure you would be unable to kill me, had you the opportunity. And now that we <br>know the truth, I doubt if we will be able to perform any portion of our terrible <br>jobs. But that is a sad thing to find out, for it means that we are doomed to <br>Contractual Discipline; and then if we do not obey, our Companies will give us <br>Extreme Severance. And you know what that means.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin nodded sadly. He knew all too well. His head drooped, and he sat in </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">disconsolate silence beside his newly found friend. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I can think of no way out,' Marvin said, after giving the matter some thought. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Perhaps we could hide in the forest for a few days; but they would be sure to <br>find us.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Suddenly, the ganzer egg spoke up. 'Come now, perhaps it isn't as hopeless </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">as you think!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What do you mean?'Marvin asked. <br>'Well now,' the ganzer egg said, dimpling with pleasure, 'it seems to me that </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">one good turn deserves another. I could get into plenty of hot water for this ... <br>But to hell with that. I think I can find a way off this planet for both of you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Both Marvin and Otis broke into exclamations of gratitude; but the ganzer </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">egg stopped them at once. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Maybe you won't thank me when you see what lies ahead,' he said </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">ominously. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Nothing could be worse than this,' Otis said. <br>'You'd be surprised,' the ganzer egg said flatly. 'You might be very surprised </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">... This way, gentlemen.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But where are we going?' Marvin asked. <br>'I'm taking you to meet the Hermit,' the ganzer egg replied, and would say no </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Through the rain forest wild and free of Ganzer (or Melde, depending upon your <br>point of view), they marched and rolled, ever alert for danger. But no creature <br>menaced them, and they came at last to a clearing in the forest. They saw a rude <br>hut in the centre of that clearing, and a humanoform creature dressed all in rags, <br>squatting in front of the hut. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That is the Hermit,' said the ganzer egg. 'He's quite insane.' <br>The two Terrans had no time in which to consider that information. The </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Hermit arose and cried, 'Now stand, hold, halt! Reveal yourselves to my <br>understanding!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I'm Marvin Flynn,' Marvin said, 'and this is my friend Otis Dagobert. We </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">want to escape from this planet.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The Hermit didn't seem to hear them; he stroked his long beard and gazed </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">thoughtfully at the treetops. In low, sombre tones, he said: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'Ere this moment came, a flight of geese <br>Passed low o'erhead, presaging woe; <br>The refuge and disconsolate owl did pass <br>This hid'n' place of mine, bereft <br>Of that which nature freely gives but man denies! <br>The stars are silent when they light our home: <br>The trees themselves proclaim the flight of kings.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>'He means,' the ganzer egg said, 'that he had a feeling you'd be coming this </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">way.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Is he crazy or something?' Otis asked. 'The way he talks--' <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'Now rede me this! I'll have no plattering roth <br>To creep between the interstices of a mind <br>Proclaiming treason.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>The Hermit said. <br>'He doesn't want you to whisper to each other.' the ganzer egg translated. 'It </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">makes him suspicious.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I could figure that much out for myself,' Flynn said. <br>'So go screw yourself.' the ganzer egg said. 'I was just trying to be helpful.' <br>The Hermit advanced several paces, halted, and said: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft7">'What wot ye here aroon?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>Marvin looked at the ganzer egg, who remained obstinately silent. So, </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">guessing at the meaning of the words, Marvin said, 'Sir, we are trying to escape <br>from this planet, and we have come to you for help.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">The Hermit shook his head and said: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'What barbrous tongue is this? A thick-mouthed sheep <br>Would clothe his meaning in a sound more clear!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>'What does he mean?'Marvin asked. <br>'You're so smart, figure it out for yourself,' the ganzer egg said. <br>'I'm sorry if I insulted you.' Marvin said. <br>'Forget it, forget it.' <br>'I really am sorry. I'd appreciate it if you'd translate for us.' <br>'All right,' the ganzer egg said, still a little sulkily. 'He says he doesn't </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">understand you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'He doesn't? But what I said to him was clear enough.' <br>'Not to him,' the ganzer egg said. 'You want to reach him, you'd better put it </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">in metre.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Me? I couldn't!' Marvin said, with that instinctual shudder of revulsion </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">which all intelligent Terran males feel at the though of verse. 'I simply couldn't! <br>Otis, maybe you--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Not me!' Otis said, alarmed. 'What do you think I am? A fag?' <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'A silence swells and grows; yet honest men <br>Speak bold, with well-formed mouth! Melikes it not <br>What this development portends.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>'He's getting edgy,' the ganzer egg said. 'You better have a shot at it.' <br>'Perhaps you could do it for us,' Otis suggested. <br>'I'm no fag,' the ganzer egg sneered. 'If you want to speak, you'll have to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">speak for yourselves.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'The only poem I can remember from school is the <i>RubÃ¡'iyÃ¡t</i>,' Marvin said. <br>'Well, go to it,' the ganzer egg said. <br>Marvin thought, twitched, and nervously said: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'Behold! A pilgrim from the forest war <br>Of race 'gainst race, does humbly implore <br>Your aid and sustenance, and help and hope. <br>Can you this humble earnest plea ignore?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>'Very shaky,' whispered the ganzer egg. 'But not bad for a first attempt.' (Otis </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">was giggling, and Marvin clouted him with his tail.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">The Hermit replied: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>More quickly now, Marvin replied: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'I hoped, in this ancient planetoid with dreams displayed <br>Of sunrise splendors, sunsets disarrayed, <br>That one poor pilgrim who did pass this way <br>Might find escape from terrors he surveyed.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>The Hermit said: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'Step forward then, my friend, my liege, my lord, <br>For all men are consistent to that state <br>Which life shall bring to them; the veriest slave <br>May some day be the king of yonder peer, <br>While this man here, this enemy by rote <br>Of graven custom, shall at hand <br>Be cup companion, if his speech be known!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>Marvin stepped forward, saying: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'Much thanks! Your doorway to the stars <br>Fits wise man and fool; yet still it bars <br>The Mute, who through his foolish tongue unused <br>Won't even get one half the way to Mars.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>Otis, who had been restraining his giggles through all this, now said: 'Hey! </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Were you saying something about me?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I certainly was,' Marvin said. 'You'd better start versifying if you want to get </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">out of here.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Well, rats, you're doing it for both of us.' <br>'Nope. The Hermit just said you have to speak for yourself.' <br>'My God, what'll I do? Otis muttered. 'I don't know any poetry.' <br>'You better think of something,' the ganzer egg said. <br>'Well ... all I can remember is a little Swinburne which some goopey girl </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">talked to me once. It's pretty stupid stuff.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Let's hear it,' Marvin said. <br>Otis sweated and swotted, and at last intoned: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'When the spaceships of Earth are on distant planets, <br>The soul of a man, be he slender or tall, <br>Desires his home, for it pulls like ten magnets, <br>Filling his heart as great waves fill a hall. <br>And the great green sensation of gratitude <br>Is entranced by the welcoming attitude <br>Of a heroic Hermit, whose modulent mood </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>The Hermit said: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'I find thee apt: 'Tis parlous to relate <br>In these lean times a halting tongue may work <br>Quick mischief 'pon its saddened owner-lord.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>Marvin said: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'Ali come, take Marvin Flynn away, and leave <br>The Rest to wrangle! He would grieve <br>To find his body torn and wounded: therefore now <br>He'd like to go, whilst others stand and cheer.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>The Hermit said: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'Away then, gentlemen! Hearts high, <br>Feet firm in stirrups, head uplifted be ...' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>And so they proceeded in sing-song fashion to the Hermit's hut, where they </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">saw, hidden away under some sheets of bark, an illegal Mindsender, of an <br>ancient and curious design. And Marvin learned that there was method in even <br>the direst madness. For the Hermit had been on this planet for less than a year, <br>and already had made a considerable fortune by smuggling refugees to the less <br>savoury labour markets of the galaxy. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">It was not ethical, but as the Hermit put it: <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft8">'Call you it dastardly, then, the tricks I play <br>With this my engine? Sobeit! Nay, I'll not dispute <br>The arid-abstract trueness of your plea. <br>Yet think upon't; 'tis folly to refuse bad wine <br>When chok't with desert thirst. Not so? Then why <br>So harshly judge the salvor of your life? <br>'Tis damned ingratitude of most perversity - <br>To slap the hand that plucked Death's grip from thee!' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">find. Despite his protestations to the contrary, the young man showed a small <br>but very promising streak of sadism. Accordingly, the Hermit had Swapped him <br>into the mind of a dental assistant on Prodenda IX. That planet, just to the left of <br>the South Ridge stars if you come by way of Procyon, had been settled by a <br>group of Terrans who felt strongly about fluorine, despising this chemical group <br>as though it were the devil itself. On Prodenda IX they could live fluorine-free, <br>with the assistance of many dental architects, as they were called. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The ganzer egg wished Marvin the best of good fortune and rolled off into </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the forest. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'And now,' the Hermit said, 'we come to the problem of you. It seems to me, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">considering your personality quite objectively, that you have a definite aptitude <br>as a victim.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Me?' Marvin asked. <br>'Yes, you,' the Hermit replied. <br>'A victim?' <br>'Definitely a victim.' <br>'I'm not so sure.' Marvin replied. He stated it that way out of politeness; </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">actually, he was quite sure the Hermit was wrong. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well, I'm sure,' the Hermit said. 'And I dare say I've had more experience in </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">job placement than you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I suppose you have ... I notice that you are no longer speaking in verse.' <br>'Of course not,' the Hermit said. 'Why should I?' <br>'Because earlier,' Marvin said, 'you had been speaking only in verse.' <br>'But that was entirely different,' the Hermit said. 'I was outside then. I had to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">protect myself.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But what about now?' <br>'Now I am in my house and therefore quite safe. I have no need for the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">protective language of verse.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Does verse really protect you outside?' Marvin asked. <br>'It certainly does. I have lived on this planet for over a year, hunted by two </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">murderous races who would kill me on sight if they could find me. And in that <br>time I have suffered no harm whatsoever. What do you think about that?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well, it's very fine, of course. But how do you know it's your language that </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">protects you?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I infer it,' the Hermit said. 'It seems a reasonable enough assumption.' <br>'Yes, sir,' Marvin said. 'But I don't quite see the relationship between your </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">language and your safety.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I'll be damned if I see it, either,' the Hermit said. 'I like to think of myself as </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">a rational man, but the efficacy of verse is one thing that I am reluctantly forced <br>to accept on faith. It <i>works</i>; what more can I say?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Have you ever thought of experimenting?' Marvin asked. 'I mean, speaking </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">outside <i>without</i> your language of verse? You might find you don't need it.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'So I might,' the Hermit replied. 'And if you tried walking on the ocean </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'It's not really the same thing,' Marvin said. <br>'It's exactly the same thing,' the Hermit told him. 'All of us live by the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">employment of countless untested assumptions, the truth of falsehood of which <br>we can determine only through the hazard of our lives. Since most of us value <br>our lives more than the truth, we leave such drastic tests for the fanatics.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I don't try to walk on water,' Marvin said, 'because I've seen men drown.' <br>'And I,' the Hermit said, 'do not speak a prose language outside because I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">have seen too many men killed while speaking it; but I have not seen one single <br>verse-speaker killed.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Well ... to each his own.' <br>'The acceptance of indeterminacy is the beginning of wisdom,' the Hermit </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">quoted. 'But we were talking about you and victimization. I repeat, you have an <br>aptitude, which opens the possibility of an extremely interesting position for <br>you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I am not interested,' Marvin said. 'What else do you have available?' <br>'Nothing else,' the Hermit said. <br>By a remarkable coincidence, Marvin heard at that moment a great crashing </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">and thundering in the underbrush outside, and deduced that it was either the <br>Meldens or the Ganzers, or both, coming in pursuit of him. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I accept the job,' Marvin said. 'But you're wrong.' <br>He had the satisfaction of the last word; but the Hermit had the satisfaction of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the last deed. For, arranging his equipment and adjusting his dials, he closed the <br>switch and sent Marvin off to his new career on the planet Celsus V. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br> <br> <br> <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>CHAPTER 15 </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">On Celsus V, the giving and receiving of gifts is a cultural imperative. To refuse <br>a gift is unthinkable; the emotion it raises in a Celsian is comparable to the <br>incest-dread of a Terran. Normally, this causes no trouble. Most gifts are white <br>gifts, intended to express various shades of love, gratitude, tenderness, etc. But <br>there are also grey gifts of warning, and black gifts of death. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Thus, a certain public official received a handsome snout ring from his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">constituents. It was imperiously designed for two week's wear. It was a splendid <br>object, and it had only one flaw. It ticked. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">A creature of another race might have flung it into the nearest ditch. But no </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Celsian in his right mind would do that. He wouldn't even have the ring </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">examined. Celsians live by the motto: DO not look a gift in the teeth. Besides, if <br>word of his suspicion leaked out, it would cause an irreparable public scandal. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">He had to wear that damned ring for two weeks. <br>But the damn thing was <i>ticking</i>. <br>The official, whose name was Marduk Kras, pondered the problem. He </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">thought about his constituents, and various ways he had helped them, and <br>various other ways he had failed them. The ring was a warning, that much was <br>clear. It was <i>at best</i> a warning - a grey gift. At worst, it was a black gift - a small <br>bomb of popular design, which would blow his head off after the elapse of <br>several anxiety-ridden days. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marduk was not suicidal; he knew that he could not wear that damned ring. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">But he also knew that he <i>had</i> to wear that damned ring. Thus, he found himself <br>facing a classic Celsian dilemma. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Would they do that to <i>me</i>?' Marduk asked himself. 'Just because I re-zoned </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">their dirty old residential neighbourhood for heavy industry, and entered into an <br>agreement with the Landlords' Guild to raise their rents 320 per cent in return for <br>a promise of new plumbing within fifty years? I mean to say, good Lord, I've <br>never pretended to be <i>omniscient</i>; I may have made mistakes here and there, I <br>freely admit it. But is that sufficient cause to commit what anyone must view as <br>a deeply antisocial act?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The ring ticked merrily away, tickling his snout and alarming his senses. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marduk thought of other officials whose heads had been blown off by dimwitted <br>hotheads. Yes, it might very possibly be a black gift. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Those stupid molters!' Marduk snarled, relieving his feelings with an insult </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">he would never have dared voice in public. He was feeling sorely aggrieved. <br>You worked your hearts out for those slack-skinned, wart-nosed idiots, and what <br>was your reward? A bomb to wear in your nose! </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">For one hectic moment he contemplated throwing the ring into the nearest </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">chlorine tank. <i>That</i> would show them! And there was precedent for it. Had not <br>the saintly Voreeg spurned the Total Offering of the Three Ghosts? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Yes ... but the Ghosts' Offering, according to accepted exegesis, had been a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">subtle attack upon the spirit of Gift-Giving, and therefore at the very core of <br>society; for by making a Total Offering, they had precluded the possibility of <br>any future gifts. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Besides - what was admirable for a Saint of the Second Kingdom would be </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">execrable for a petty official of the Tenth Democracy. Saints can do anything; <br>ordinary men must do what is expected of them. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marduk's shoulders slumped. He plastered warm mud on his feet, but it </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">brought no relief. There was no way out. One Celsian could not stand alone <br>against organized society. He would have to wear the ring, and wait for the <br>mind-splitting moment when the tick stopped ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But wait! There was a way! Yes, yes, he could see it now! It would take </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">clever arrangement; but if he brought it off, he could have safety <i>and</i> social </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">approval. If only that damned ring gave him time ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marduk Kras made several urgent calls, and arranged for himself to be </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">ordered to the planet Taami II (the Tahiti of the Ten-Star Region) on urgent <br>business. Not corporeally, of course; no responsible official would spend local <br>funds to ship his body across a hundred light years when all that was required <br>was his mind. Frugal, trustworthy Marduk would travel by Mindswap. He would <br>satisfy the form, if not the spirit, of Celsian custom by leaving his body behind <br>with the gift ring ticking merrily in its nose. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He had to find a mind to inhabit his body during his absence. But that was </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">not difficult. There are too many minds in the galaxy, and not enough bodies to <br>go around. (Why this should be, no one really knows. After all, everyone was <br>given one of each to begin with. But some people always seem to end up with <br>more than they need, be it wealth, power, or bodies; and some with less.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marduk got in touch with Hermit Enterprises (Bodies for Any Purpose). The </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Hermit had just the thing for him: a clean-cut young Terran male who was in <br>imminent danger of losing his life, and was willing to take his chances with a <br>ticking nose ring. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Thus Marvin Flynn came to Celsus V. <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">For once there was no need to hurry. Upon arrival, Marvin was able to follow <br>prescribed Swapping procedure. He lay perfectly still, growing slowly <br>accustomed to his new corpus. He tested his limbs, checked out his senses, and <br>scanned the primary culture-configuration load as radiated from the forebrain for <br>analogue and similitude factors. Then he sized up the hindbrain emotional end <br>structure factor for crux, nadir and saddlepoint. Nearly all of this was automatic. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He found the Celsian body a good fit, with a high aspect of jointure and an </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">excellent main-sequence random-dispersion pattern. There were problems, of <br>course: the delta curve was absurdly elliptic, and the UYPs (universal Y points) <br>were falciform rather than trapezoidal. But you had to expect that on a Type 3B <br>planet; under normal circumstances, it would never cause him any trouble. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Taken all in all, it was a body-enviromnent-culture-role cluster with which he </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">could empathize and identify. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Feels pretty good,' Marvin summed up for himself. 'If only that damned nose </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">ring doesn't blow up.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He got up and took stock of his surroundings. The first thing he saw was a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">note that Marduk Kras had left for him, tied to his wrist so he wouldn't overlook <br>it. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>Dear Swapper, [it read] </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:118"><nobr><span class="ft2">Welcome to Celsus! I realize that you may not feel very welcome, under </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">the circumstances, and I regret it nearly as much as you do. But I would <br>advise you sincerely to put all thought of sudden demise out of your mind, </span></nobr></DIV>

It may console you to <br>know that the statistical incidence of death by black gift is no greater than <br>that of being killed in a plutonium-mine accident, if you happened to be a <br>plutonium miner. So relax and enjoy yourself. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:118"><nobr><span class="ft2">My apartment and all that is in it are yours to enjoy. My body also, though </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:446"><nobr><span class="ft2">Your Sincere Friend, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:494"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marduk Kras </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>At first Marvin was irritated by the note. But then he laughed and crumpled it </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">up. Marduk was undoubtedly a scoundrel, but he was a likeable one, and not <br>ungenerous. Marvin decided to make the best of his dubious bargain, forget <br>about the putative bomb nestling just above his lip, and enjoy his time on <br>Celsus. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He went on an exploration of his new home, and was well satisfied with what </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">he found. It was a bachelor burrow, designed for residence rather than for <br>reproduction. Its main construction feature - pentabrachation - reflected Kras' <br>status as a public official. Less fortunate sorts had to get by with three or four <br>gallery systems; and in the slums of North Bogger, whole families were <br>crowded into wretched mono- and duo-brachate systems. Housing reform had <br>been promised in the near future, however. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The kitchen was neat and modem, and well stocked with gourmet items. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">There were jars of candied annelids, and a bowl of exotic Alcyonium Salad <br>mixture, and delicious titbits of Tubipora, Pennatula, Gorgonia, and Renilla. <br>There was a can of Goose Barnacle in rotifer and orchid sauce, and a quick-<br>frozen package of sweet and sour Uca. But - how like a bachelor - there were no <br>staples, not even a gastropod loaf or a bottle of carbonated Ginger Honey. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Wandering down the long, curving galleries, Marvin found the music room. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marduk had not stinted here. A gigantic Imperial amplifier dominated the room, <br>flanked by two Tyrant-model speakers. Marduk used a Whirlpool semi-mix <br>microphone, with a forty-bbc channel rejection, an 'expanding' type sense-<br>discrimination selector, with a floating throat-slot 'passive' director. Pick-up was <br>by image regeneration, but there was provision for changing over to decay <br>modulation. Although not professional in quality, it was a very good amateur <br>rig. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The heart of the system, of course, was the Insectarium. This particular one </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">was an Ingenuator, the Super-Max model, with both automatic and manual <br>selection and mixture controls, regulated feed and disposal, and various <br>maximizing and minimizing features. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin selected a grasshopper gavotte (Korestal, 431B) and listened to the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">thrilling tracheal obbligato and the subtle bass accompaniment of the paired <br>Malphigian tubules. Although Marvin's appreciation was casual, he was well <br>aware of the virtuoso ability of this particular performer: a Blue-Striped <br>Grasshopper, his second thoracic segment pulsating slightly, visible in his own <br>compartment of the Insectarium. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Leaning down, Marvin nodded in appreciation. The Blue-Stripped </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Grasshopper clicked mandibles, then turned back to his music. (He had been <br>bred especially for treble and brilliance, a flashy performer, more showy than <br>sound. But Marvin did not know this.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin turned off the selection, flipped the status switch from Active to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Dormant mode; the grasshopper went back to sleep. The Insectarium was well <br>stocked, especially with Mayfly symphonies and the strange new cutworm <br>songs, but Marvin had too much to explore to bother with music just now. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">In the living-room, Marvin lowered himself into a stately old clay bank (a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">genuine Wormstetter), rested his head against the well-worn granite headrest, <br>and tried to relax. But the ring in his snout ticked away, a continual intrusion to <br>his sense of well-being. He reached down and picked at random a quick-stick <br>from a pile on a low table. He ran his antennae over the grooves, but it was no <br>use. He couldn't concentrate on light fiction. Impatiently he threw the quick-<br>stick aside and tried to make some plans. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But he was in the grip of an implacable dynamism. He had to assume that the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">moments of his life were severely limited, and those moments were passing <br>away. He wanted to do something to commemorate his final hours. But what <br>was there he could do? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He slid out of the Wormstetter and paced the main gallery, his claws clicking </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">irritably. Then, coming to an abrupt decision, he went to the wardrobe room. <br>Here he selected a new casing of gold-bronze chitin, and arranged it carefully <br>over his shoulders. He plastered his facial bristles with perfumed glue, and <br>arranged them <i>en brosse</i> over his cheeks. He applied a mild stiffener to his <br>antennae, pointed them at a jaunty sixty degrees, and allowed them to droop in <br>their attractive natural curve. Lastly, he dusted his midsection with Lavender <br>Sand, and outlined his shoulder joints with lamp-black. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Surveying himself in the mirror, he decided that the effect was not </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">unpleasing. He was well dressed, but not dandified. Judging as objectively as he <br>could, he decided that he was a presentable, rather scholarly-looking young <br>fellow. Not a Squig Star by any means, but definitely not a drunfiler. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">He left his burrow by the main entrance, and replaced the entrance plug. <br>It was dusk. Stars glittered overhead; they seemed no more numerous than </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the myriad lights in the entrances of the countless burrows, both commercial and <br>private, which made up the pulsating heart of the city. The sight thrilled Marvin. <br>Surely, surely, somewhere in the endless intertwining corridors of the great city, <br>there would be that for him which would bring pleasure. Or, at least, a soft and <br>forgetful surcease. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Thus, Marvin walked dolorously, yet with a tremulous hopefulness, towards </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the hectic and beckoning Main Groove of the city, there to find what chance <br>held out for him or fate decreed. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">With a long rolling stride and a creaking of leather boots, Marvin Flynn strode <br>down the wooden sidewalk. Faintly there came to him the mingled odors of <br>sagebrush and chaparral. On either side of him the adobe walls of the town <br>glittered under the moon like dull Mexican silver. From a nearby saloon there <br>came the strident tones of a banjo-- </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Frowning deeply, Marvin stopped in midstride. Sagebrush? Saloons? What </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">was going on around here? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Something wrong, stranger?' a harsh voice intoned. <br>Flynn whirled. A figure stepped out of the shadows near the General Store. It </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">was a saddlebum, a snuffling, slump-shouldered loafer with a dusty black hat <br>crushed comically on his begrimed forehead. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Yes, something is very wrong,' Marvin said. 'Everything seems - strange.' <br>' 'Tain't nothing to be alarmed about,' the saddlebum reassured him. 'You </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">have merely changed your system of metaphoric reference, and the Lord knows <br>there's no crime in that. As a matter of fact, you should be happy to give up <br>those dreary animal-insect comparisons.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'There was nothing wrong with my comparisons,' Marvin said, 'After all, I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">am on Celsus V, and I <i>do</i> live in a burrow.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'So what?' the saddlebum said. 'Haven't you any imagination?' <br>'I've got plenty of imagination!' Marvin said indignantly. 'But that's hardly </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the point. I simply mean that it is inconsistent to think like a cowboy on Earth <br>when one is actually a sort of molelike creature on Celsus.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'It can't be helped,' the saddlebum said. 'What's happened is, you've </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">overloaded your analogizing faculty, thereby blowing a fuse. Accordingly, your <br>perceptions have taken up the task of experimental normalization. This state is <br>known as &quot;metaphoric deformation&quot;.' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Now Marvin remembered the warning he had received from Mr Blanders </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">concerning this phenomenon. Metaphoric deformation, that disease of the <br>interstellar traveller, had struck him suddenly and without warning. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He knew that he should be alarmed, but instead felt only a mild surprise. His </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">emotions were consistent with his perceptions, since a change unperceived is a <br>change unfelt. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'When,' Marvin asked, 'will I start to see things as they really are?' <br>'That last is a question for a philosopher,' the saddlebum told him. 'But </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">speaking in a limited fashion, this particular syndrome will pass if you ever get <br>back to Earth. But if you continue travelling the process of perceptual <br>analogizing will increase; though occasional short-lived remissions into your <br>primary situation-perception context may be expected.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin found that interesting, but unalarming. He hitched up his jeans and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">said, 'Waal, reckon a man's gotta play out the hand that's dealt to him, and I ain't <br>about to stand here all night jawing about it. Just who are you, stranger?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I,' said the saddlebum, with a certain smugness, 'am he without whom your </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">dialogue would be impossible. I am Necessity personified; without me, you <br>would have had to remember the Theory of Metaphoric Deformation all by <br>yourself, and I doubt that you are capable of it. You may cross my palm with <br>silver.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That's for gipsies,' Marvin said scornfully. <br>'Sorry,' the saddlebum said, without the least show of embarrassment. 'Got a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">tailor-made?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Got the makings,' Marvin said, flipping him a sack of Bull Durham. He </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">contemplated his new companion for a moment, then said, 'Waal, yore a mangy-<br>looking critter, and it seems to me yore half jackass and half prairie dog. But I <br>reckon I'm stuck with you no matter who you are.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Bravo,' the saddlebum said gravely. 'You conquer change of context with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">that same sureness with which an ape conquers a banana.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Reckon that's a tech highfalutin',' Marvin said equably. 'What's the next </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">move, perfesser?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'We shall proceed,' the saddlebum said, 'to yonder saloon of evil repute.' <br>'Yippee,' Marvin said, and strode lean-hipped through the batwinged saloon </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">doors. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Within the saloon, a female attached herself to Marvin's arm. She looked up </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">at him with a smile of vermilion bas-relief. Her unfocused eyes were pencilled <br>in imitation of gaiety; her flaccid face was painted with the lying hieroglyphics <br>of animation. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'C'mon upstairs with me, kid,' the grisly beldame cried. 'Lotsa fun, lotsa </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">laughs!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'It is droll to realize,' the saddlebum said, 'that Custom has decreed this lady's </span></nobr></DIV>

And <br>she ground lasciviously against him with her pudenda, which was as heavily <br>armoured as the forehead of a Tyrannosaurus. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well, er, thank you so terribly much anyhow,' Marvin said, 'but I don't think </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">just at the moment I--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'You don't want no <i>lovin'</i>?' the woman asked incredulously. <br>'Well, actually, I can't really say that I do.' <br>The woman planted knobkerry fists on tom-tom hips and said, 'That I should </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">live to see this day!' But then she softened, and said, 'Turn not away from Venus' <br>sweet-perfumed home of pleasure! Thou must strive, sir, to overcome this most <br>unseemly gesture of unmanliness. Come, my lord! The bugle sounds; it awaits <br>thee now to mount and fiercely press thy charge!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Oh, I rather think not,' Marvin said, laughing hollowly. <br>She seized him by the throat with a hand the size and shape of a Chilean </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">poncho. 'You'll do it <i>now</i>, you lousy cowardly inward-directed goddamn <br>narcissist bastard, and you'll do it good and proper, or by Ares I'll snap your <br>scrawny windpipe like a Michaelmas chicken!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">A tragedy seemed in the making, for the woman's passion rendered her </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">incapable of a judicious modification of her demands, while Marvin's reputed <br>great vaulting lance had shrunken to the size of a pea.

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Don't you dare hurt him!' the saddlebum said, his voice a squeaky contralto. <br>Marvin, quick if not apt, rejoindered, 'Yes, tell her to stop <i>pawing</i> me! I mean </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">to say it is simply too much, one cannot even stroll out of one's house in the <br>evening without encountering some <i>disgraceful</i> incident--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Don't cry, for God's sake, don't cry!' the saddlebum said. 'You know I can't </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I am <i>not</i> crying!' Marvin said, snuffling. 'It is just that she has ruined this </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I'll get you another!' the saddlebum said. 'But I cannot abide another scene!' <br>The woman was staring at them slack-jawed, and Marvin was able to utilize </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">her moment of inattention by taking a pry bar out of his tool kit, setting it under <br>her swollen red fingers, and prying himself free of her grip. Seizing the <br>dwindling moment of opportunity, Marvin and the saddlebum sprinted out the <br>door, leaped around the comer, broadjumped across the street, and polevaulted <br>to freedom. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Once clear of the immediate danger, Marvin came abruptly to his senses. The <br>scales of metaphoric deformation fell away for the moment, and he experienced <br>a perceptual experiential remission. It was all too painfully apparent now, that <br>the 'saddlebum' was actually a large parasite beetle of the species <i>S Cthulu</i>. <br>There could be no mistake about this, since the Cthulu beetle is characterized by <br>a secondary salivary duct located just below and slightly to the left of the <br>suboesophegal ganglion. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">These beetles feed upon borrowed emotions, their own having long ago </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">atrophied. Typically, they lurk in dark and shadowy places, waiting for a <br>careless Celsian to pass within range of their segmented maxilla. That is what <br>happened to Marvin. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Realizing this, Marvin directed at the beetle an emotion of anger so powerful </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">that the Cthulu, victim of its own hyperacute emotional receptors, fell over <br>unconscious in the road. That done, Marvin readjusted his gold-bronze casing, <br>stiffened his antennae, and continued down the road. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">He came to a bridge that crossed a great flowing river of sand. Standing on the </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">centre span, he gazed downwards into the black depths that rolled inexorably <br>onwards to the mysterious sand sea. Half-hypnotized he gazed, the nose ring <br>beating its quick tattoo of mortality three times faster than the beat of his hearts. <br>And he thought: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Bridges are receptacles of opposed ideas. Their horizontal distance speaks to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">us of our transcendence; their vertical declivity reminds us unalterably of the <br>imminence of failure, the sureness of death. We push outwards across obstacles, <br>but the primordial fall is forever beneath our feet. We build, construct, fabricate; <br>but death is the supreme architect, who shapes heights only that there may be <br>depths. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">O Celsians, throw your well-wrought bridges across a thousand rivers, and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">tie together the disparate contours of the planet; your mastery is for naught, for <br>the land is still beneath you, still waiting, still patient. Celsians, you have a road <br>to follow, but it leads assuredly to death. Celsians, despite your cunning, you <br>have one lesson still to learn: the heart is fashioned to receive the spear, and all <br>other effects are extraneous. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">These were Marvin's thoughts as he stood on the bridge. And a great longing </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">overcame him, a desire to be finished with desire, to forgo pleasure and pain, to <br>quit the petty modes of achievement and failure, to have done with distractions, <br>and get on with the business of life, which was death. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Slowly he climbed to the rail, and there stood poised over the twisting </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">currents of sand. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a shadow detach <br>itself from a pillar, move tentatively to the rail, stand erect, poise itself over the <br>abyss and lean precariously outwards-- </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Stop! Wait!' Marvin cried. His own desire for destruction had been abruptly </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">terminated. He saw only a fellow creature in peril. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The shadowy figure gasped, and abruptly lunged towards the yawning river </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">below. Marvin moved simultaneously and managed to catch an ankle. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The ensuing wrench almost pulled him over the rail. But recovering quickly, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin attached suckers to the porous stone sidewalk, spread his lower limbs for <br>maximum purchase, wrapped two upper limbs around a light pole, and <br>maintained a tenacious grip with his remaining two arms. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There was a moment of charged equilibrium; then Marvin's strength </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">prevailed over the weight of the would-be suicide. Slowly, carefully, Marvin <br>pulled, shifting his grip from tarsus to tibia, hauling without respite until he had <br>brought that person to a point of safety on the roadbed of the bridge. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">All recollection of his own self-destructive desires had left him. He strode </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">forward and grasped the suicider by the shoulders, shaking fiercely. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'You damned fool!' Marvin shouted. 'What kind of a coward are you? Only </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">an idiot or a madman takes an out like that. Haven't you any guts at all, you <br>darnned--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He stopped in mid-expletive. The would-be suicide was facing him, </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Later, in a private booth in a bridgeside restaurant, Marvin apologized for his <br>harsh words, which had been torn from him by shock rather than conviction. But <br>the woman, gracefully clicking her claw, refused to accept his apology. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Because you are right,' she said. 'My attempt was the act of an idiot or a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">madwoman, or both. Your analysis was correct, I fear. You should have let me <br>jump.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin perceived how fair she was. A small woman, coming barely to his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">upper thorax, she was exquisitely made. Her midbody had the true sweet <br>cylinder curves, and her proud head sat slightly forward of her body at a <br>heartwrenching five degrees from the vertical. Her features were perfection, <br>from the nicely bulged forehead to the angular sweep of jaw. Her twin <br>ovipositors were modestly hidden behind a white satin sash, cut in princess style <br>and revealing just a tantalizing suggestion of the shining green flesh beneath <br>them. Her legs, all of them, were clad in orange windings, draped to reveal the <br>lissome segmentation of the joints. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">A would-be suicide she may have been; but she was also the most stunning </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">beauty that Marvin had seen on Celsus. His throat went dry at the sight of her, <br>and his pulse began to race. He found that he was staring at the white satin that <br>concealed and revealed her high-tilted ovipositors. He turned away, and found <br>that he was looking at the sensual marvel of a long, segmented limb. Blushing <br>furiously, he forced himself to look at the puckered beauty scar on her forehead. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">She seemed unconscious of his fervent attention. Unselfconsciously she said, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Perhaps we should introduce ourselves - under the circumstances!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">They both laughed immoderately at her witticism. 'My name is Marvin </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Mine is Phthistia Held,' the young woman said. <br>'I'll call you Cathy, if you don't mind,' Marvin said. <br>They both laughed again. Then Cathy grew serious. Taking note of the too-</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Of course,' Marvin said, rising. 'When may I see you again?' <br>'Never,' she said in a low voice. <br>'But I must!' Marvin said. 'I mean to say, now that I've found you I can never </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">one little thought to me?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'We must not say goodbye!' Marvin said. <br>'Oh, you'll get by,' she replied, not cruelly. <br>'I'll never smile again,' Marvin told her. <br>'Somebody else will be taking my place,' she predicted. <br>'You are temptation!' he shouted in a fury. <br>'We are like two ships that pass in the night,' she corrected. <br>'Will we never meet again?' Marvin queried. <br>'Time alone can tell.' <br>'My prayer is to be there with you,' Marvin said hopefully. <br>'East of the Sun and West of the Moon,' she intoned. <br>'You're mean to me,' Marvin pouted. <br>'I didn't know what time it was,' she said. 'But I know what time it is now!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">And so saying, she whirled and darted out the door. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin watched her leave, then sat down at the bar. 'One for my baby, and </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'A woman's a two-face,' the bartender commented sympathetically, pouring a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">drink. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I got the mad-about-her-sad-without-her blues,' Marvin replied. <br>'A fellow needs a girl,' the bartender told him. <br>Marvin finished his drink and held out his glass. 'A pink cocktail for a blue </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">lady,' he ordered. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'She may be weary,' the bartender suggested. <br>'I don't know why I love her like I do,' Marvin stated. 'But at least I do know </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">why there's no sun up in the sky. In my solitude she haunts me like a tinkling <br>piano in the next apartment. But I'll be around no matter how she treats me now. <br>Maybe it was just one of those things; yet I'll remember April and her, and the <br>evening breeze caressed the trees but not for me, and--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There is no telling how long Marvin might have continued his lament had not </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">a voice at the level of his ribs and two feet to his left whispered, 'Hey, meester.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin turned and saw a small, plump, raggedly dressed Celsian sitting on </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the next bar stool. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">out a long, double-edged knife, and drove it into the bartender's heart, killing <br>him instantly. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I can understand that,' Marvin said. <br>'Yet still,' Valdez said, more sternly, 'when an exploitator del norte insults </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But if you don't know where she lives--' <br>'It is quite unimportant,' Valdez said, holding up a stern musteline forefinger. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'To where she weel be,' Valdez replied serenely. <br>'Oh,' Marvin said. <br>They walked on through towering mineral marvels, coming at last into </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">scrubby foothills that lay like tired walruses around the gleaming blue whale of <br>a lofty mountain range. Another hour passed, and Marvin again grew disquieted. <br>But this time he expressed his anxiety in a roundabout fashion, hoping by guile <br>to gain insight. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Have you known Cathy long?' he asked. <br>'I have never had the good fortune to meet her,' Valdez replied. <br>'Then you saw her for the first time in the restaurant with me?' <br>'Unfortunately I did not even see her there, since I was in the men's room </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">passing a kidney stone during the time of your conversation with her. I may <br>have caught a glimpse of her as she turned from you and departed, but more <br>likely I saw only the Doppler effect produced by the swinging red door.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Then you know nothing whatsoever about Cathy?' <br>'Only the little I have heard from you, which, frankly, amounts to practically </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">nothing.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Then how,' Marvin asked, 'can you possibly take me to where she will be?' <br>'It is simple enough,' Valdez said. 'A moment's reflection should clear the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">matter for you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin reflected for several moments, but the matter stayed refractory. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Consider it logically,' Valdez said. 'What is my problem? <i>To find Cathy</i>. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">What do I know about Cathy? Nothing.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That doesn't sound so good,' Marvin said. <br>'But it is only half of the problem. Granted that I know nothing about Cathy, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">what do I know about <i>Finding</i>?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What?' Marvin asked. <br>'It happens that I know everything about Finding,' Valdez said triumphantly, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">gesturing with his graceful terracotta hands. 'For it happens that I am an expert <br>in the Theory of Searches!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'The what?' Marvin asked. <br>'The Theory of Searches!' Valdez said, a little less triumphantly. <br>'I see.' Marvin said, unimpressed. 'Well ... that's great, and I'm sure it's a very </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">good theory. But if you don't know anything about Cathy, I don't see how any <br>theory will help.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Valdez sighed, not unpleasantly, and touched his moustache with a puce-</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">coloured hand. 'My friend, if you knew all about Cathy - her habits, friends, <br>desires, dislikes, hopes, fears, dreams, intentions. and the like - do you think you <br>would be able to find her?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I'm sure I could,' Marvin said. <br>'Even without knowing the Theory of Searches?' <br>'Yes.' <br>'Well then,' Valdez said, 'apply that same reasoning to the reverse condition. I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">know all there is to know about the Theory of Searches, and therefore I need to <br>know nothing about Cathy.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Are you sure it's the same thing?' Marvin asked. <br>'It has to be. After all, an equation is an equation. Solving from one end may </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">take longer than from the other end, but cannot affect the outcome. In fact, we <br>are really quite fortunate to know nothing about Cathy. Specific data sometimes <br>has a way of interfering with the well-wrought operation of a theory. But we <br>shall suffer no such discomfiture in this instance.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">They marched steadily upwards, across the steepening face of a mountain </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">slope. A bitter wind screamed and buffeted at them, and patches of hoar-frost <br>began to appear underfoot. Valdez talked about his researches into the Theory of <br>Searches, citing the following typical cases: Hector looking for Lysander, Adam <br>questing after Eve, Galahad reconnoitering for the Holy Grail, Fred C. Dobbs' <br>seeking the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Edwin Arlington Robinson's <br>perquisitions for colloquial self-expression in a typically American milieu, <br>Gordon Sly's investigations of Naiad McCarthy, energy's pursuit of entropy, <br>God's hunt for man, and Yang's pursual of Yin. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'From these specifics,' Valdez said, 'we derive the general notion of Search </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">and its most important corollaries.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin was too miserable to answer. It had suddenly occurred to him that </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">one could die in this chill and waterless wasteland. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Amusingly enough,' Valdez said, 'the Theory of Searches forces upon us the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">immediate conclusion that nothing can be truly (or ideally) lost. Consider: for a <br>thing to be <i>lost</i>, it would require <i>a place to be lost in</i>. But no such place can be <br>found, since simple multiplicity carries no implication of qualitative <br>differentiation. In Search terms, every place is like every other place. Therefore, <br>we replace the concept <i>Lost</i> with the concept of <i>indeterminate placement</i>, <br>which, of course, is susceptible to logico-mathematical analysis.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But if Cathy isn't really lost,' Marvin said, 'then we can't really find her.' <br>'That statement is true, as far as it goes,' Valdez said. 'But of course, it is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">merely Ideal notion, and of little value in this instance. For operational purposes <br>we must modify the Theory of Searches. In fact, we must reverse the major <br>premise of the theory and reaccept the original concepts of Lost and Found.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'It sounds very complicated,' Marvin said. <br>'The complication is more apparent than real,' Valdez reassured him. 'An </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">analysis of the problem yields the result. We take the proposition: &quot;Marvin <br>searches for Cathy.&quot; That seems fairly to describe our situation, does it not?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I think it does,' Marvin said cautiously. <br>'Well then, what does the statement imply?' <br>'It implies - it implies that I search for Cathy.' <br>Valdez shook his nut-brown head in annoyance. 'Look deeper, my impatient </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">young friend! Identity is not inference! The statement expresses the activity of <br>your quest, and therefore implies the passivity of Cathy's state-of-being-lost. But <br>this cannot be true. Her passivity is unacceptable, since ultimately one searches <br>for oneself, and no one is exempt from that search. We must accept Cathy's <br>search for you (herself), just as we accept your search for her (yourself). Thus <br>we achieve our primary permutation: &quot;Marvin searches for Cathy who searches <br>for Marvin.&quot; ' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Do you really think she's looking for me?' Marvin asked. <br>'Of course she is, whether she knows it or not. After all, she is a person in her </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">own right; she cannot be considered an Object, a mere something-lost.We must <br>grant her autonomy, and realize that if you find her, then, equally, she finds you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I never thought of that.' Marvin said, <br>'Well, it's simple enough once you understand the theory,' Valdez said. 'Now, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">to ensure our success, we must decide upon the optimum form of Search. <br>Obviously, if both of you are actively questing, your chances of finding each <br>other are considerably lessened. Consider two people seeking one another up <br>and down the endless crowded aisles of a great department store, and contrast <br>that with the improved strategy of one seeking, and the other standing at a fixed <br>position and waiting to be found. The mathematics are a little intricate, so you <br>will just have to take my word for it. The best chance of you/her finding her/you <br>will be for one to search, and the other to allow himself /herself to be searched <br>for. Our deepest folk wisdom has always known this, of course.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'So what do we do?' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I have just told you!' Valdez cried. 'One must search, the other must wait. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Since we have no control over Cathy's actions, we assume that she is following <br>her instincts and looking for you. Therefore you must fight down your instincts <br>and wait, thereby allowing her to find you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'All I do is wait?' <br>'That's right.' <br>'And you really think she'll find me?' <br>'I would stake my life on it.' <br>'Well ... all right. But in that case, where are we going now?' <br>'To a place where you will wait. Technically, it is called a Location-Point.' <br>Marvin looked confused, so Valdez explained further. 'Mathematically, all </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">places are of equal potentiality insofar as the chances of her finding you are <br>concerned. Therefore we are able to choose an arbitrary Location-Point.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What Location-Point have you chosen?' Marvin asked. <br>'Since it made no real difference,' Valdez said, 'I selected the village of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Montana Verde de los Tres Picos, in Adelante Province, in the country of <br>Lombrobia.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That's your home town, isn't it?' Marvin asked. <br>'As a matter of fact, it is,' Valdez said, mildly surprised and amused. 'That, I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">suppose, is why it came so quickly to my mind.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Isn't Lombrobia a long way off?' <br>'A considerable distance,' Valdez admitted. 'But our time will not be wasted, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">since I will teach you logic, and also the folksongs of my country.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'It isn't fair,' Marvin muttered. <br>'My friend,' Valdez told him, 'when you accept help, you must be prepared to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">take what one is capable of giving, not what you would like to receive. I have <br>never denied my human limitations; but it is ungrateful of you to refer to them.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin had to be content with that, since he didn't think he could find his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">way back to the city unaided. So they marched on through the mountains, and <br>they sang many folksongs, but it was too cold for logic. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">moving leechlike up its dazzling surface. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Valdez bore up through it all with a saintlike equanimity. 'Eet ees deefecult,' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">he grinned. 'And yet - for the love which you bear for thees woman - eet ees all <br>worthwhile, sÃ­?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Yeah, sure,' Marvin mumbled. 'I guess it is.' But in truth, he was beginning </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">to doubt it. After all, he had known Cathy only for less than an hour. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">An avelanche thundered past them, and tons of white death screamed past - </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">inches from their strained and clinging bodies. Valdez smiled with serenity. <br>Flynn frowned with anxiety. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Beyond all obstacles,' Valdez intoned, 'lies that summit of accomplishment </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">which is the face and form of the beloved.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Yeah, sure,' Marvin said. <br>Spears of ice, shaken loose from a high dokalma, whirled and flashed around </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">them. Marvin thought about Cathy and found that he was unable to remember <br>what she looked like. It struck him that love at first sight was overrated. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">A high precipice loomed before them. Marvin looked at it, and at the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">shimmering ice fields beyond, and came to the conclusion that the game was <br>really not worth the candle. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I think,' Marvin said, 'that we should turn back.' <br>Valdez smiled subtly, pausing on the very edge of the vertiginous descent </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">into that wintry hell of suicidally shaped snow slides. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'My frien',' he said, 'I know why you say this.' <br>'You do?' Marvin asked. <br>'Of course. It is obvious that you do not wish me to risk my life on the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">continuance of your insensate and magnificent quest. And it is equally obvious <br>that you intend to plunge on, alone.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'It is?' Marvin asked. <br>'Certainly. It would be apparent to the most casual observer that you are </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">driven to seek your love through any and all dangers, by virtue of the unyielding <br>nature of your personality. And it is equally clear that your generous and high-<br>spirited mentality would be disturbed at the idea of involving one whom you <br>consider a close friend and bosom companion in so perilous a venture.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Well,' Marvin began, 'I'm not sure--' <br>'But I am sure,' Valdez said. 'And I reply to your unspoken question as </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">follows: Friendship bears this similarity to love: it transcends all limits.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Huh,' Marvin said. <br>'Therefore,' Valdez said, 'I shall not abandon you. We shall go on together, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">into the maw of death, if need be, for the sake of your beloved Cathy.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well, that's very nice of you,' Marvin said, eyeing the precipice ahead. 'But I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">really didn't know Cathy very well, and I don't know how well suited we would <br>be; so all in all, maybe it would be best if we got out of here--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Your words lack conviction, my young friend,' Valdez laughed. 'I beg of you </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">not to worry about my safety.' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'As a matter of fact,' Marvin said, 'I was worrying about <i>my</i> safety.' <br>'No use!' Valdez cried gaily. 'Hot passion betrays the studied coolness of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">your words. Forward, my friend!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Valdez seemed determined to force him to Cathy's side whether he wanted to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">go or not. The only solution seemed to be a quick blow to the jaw, after which <br>he would drag Valdez and himself back to civilization. He edged forward. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Valdez edged back. 'Ah no, my friend!' he cried. 'Again, overweening love </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">has rendered your motives transparent. To knock me out, is it not? Then, after <br>making sure I was safe and comfortable and well provisioned, you would plunge <br>alone into the white wilderness. But I refuse to comply. We go on together, <br>compadre!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And shouldering all their provisions, Valdez began his descent of the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">precipice. Marvin could do nothing but follow. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">We shall not bore the reader with an account of that great march across the <br>Moorescu Mountains, nor with the agonies suffered by the love-dazzled young <br>Flynn and his steadfast companion.

Nor would any but the scholarly be interested in the psychological <br>process by which Marvin was moved, through a contemplation of his own <br>sacrifices, to a fondness for the young lady in question, and then to a <i>strong</i> <br>fondness, and then to a sensation of love, and then to an overweening passion of <br>love. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Suffice it to say that all of these things happened, and that the journey across </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the mountains occupied many days and brought about many emotions. And at <br>last it came to an end. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Arriving at a last mountain crest, Marvin looked down and saw, instead of ice <br>fields, green pastures and rolling forests under a summer sun, and a little village <br>nestled in the crook of a gentle river. </span></nobr></DIV>

Here, surrounded by crystal lakes and high <br>mountains, a simple, good-hearted peasantry engage in unhurried labour beneath <br>the swan-necked palms. At midday and midnight one may hear the plaintive <br>notes of a guitar echo down the crenellated walls of the old castle. Nut-brown <br>maidens tend the dusty grape vines while a moustached cacique watches, his <br>whip curled sleepily on his hairy wrist. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">To this quaint memento of a bygone age came Flynn, led by the faithful </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Valdez. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Just outside the village, on a gentle rise of land, there was an inn, or posada. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">To this place Valdez directed them. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But is this really the best place to wait?' Marvin asked. <br>'No, it is not,' Valdez said, with a knowing smile. 'But by choosing it instead </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">of the dusty town square, we avoid the fallacy of the &quot;optimum&quot;. Also, it is more <br>comfortable here.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin bowed to the moustached man's superior wisdom and made himself </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">at home in the posada. He settled himself at an outdoor table that commanded a <br>good view of the courtyard and of the road beyond it.

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Within the hour, Marvin beheld a tiny dark figure moving slowly along the <br>gleaming white expanse of the road. Closer it came, the figure of a man no <br>longer young, his back bent beneath the weight of a heavy cylindrical object. At <br>last the man raised his haggard head and stared directly into Marvin's eyes. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Uncle Max!' Marvin cried. <br>'Why, hello, Marvin,' Uncle Max replied. 'Would you mind pouring me a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">glass of wine? This is a very dusty road.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin poured the glass of wine, scarcely believing the testimony of his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">senses; for Uncle Max had unaccountably disappeared some ten years ago. He <br>had last been seen playing golf at the Fairhaven Country Club. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What happened to you?' Marvin asked. <br>'I stumbled into a time warp on the twelfth hole,' Uncle Max said. 'If you ever </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">get back to Earth, Marvin, you might speak to the club manager about it. I have <br>never been a <i>complainer</i>; but it seems to me that the greens committee ought to <br>know about this, and possibly build a small fence or other enclosing structure. I <br>do not care so much for myself, but it might cause a nasty scandal if a child fell <br>in.' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I'll certainly tell them,' Marvin said. 'But Uncle Max, where are you going </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">now?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I have an appointment in Samarra,' Uncle Max said. 'Thank you for the wine, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">my boy, and take good care of yourself. By the way; did you know that your <br>nose is ticking?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Yes,' Marvin said. 'It's a bomb.' <br>'I suppose you know what you're doing,' Max said. 'Goodbye, Marvin.' <br>And Uncle Max trudged away down the road, his golf bag swinging from his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">back and a number two iron in his hand as a walking-stick. Marvin settled back <br>to wait. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Half an hour later, Marvin spied the figure of a woman hurrying down the road. <br>He felt a rising sensation of anticipation, but then slumped back in his chair. It <br>was not Cathy after all. It was only his mother. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'You're a long way from home, Mom,' he said quietly. <br>'I know, Marvin,' his mother said. 'But you see, I was captured by white </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">slavers.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Gosh, Mom! How did it happen?' <br>'Well, Marvin,' his mother said, 'I was simply taking a Christmas basket to a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">poor family in Cutpurse Lane, and there was a police raid, and various other <br>things happened, and I was drugged and awoke in Buenos Aires in a luxurious <br>room with a man standing near me and leering and asking me in broken English <br>if I <i>wanted a little fun</i>. And when I said no, he bent down and clasped me in his <br>arms in an embrace that was plainly designed to be lecherous.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Gosh! What happened then?' <br>'Well,' his mother said, 'I was lucky enough to remember a little trick that </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Mrs Jasperson had told me. Did you know that you can kill a man by striking <br>him forcibly under the nose? Well, it actually does work. I didn't like to do it, <br>Marvin, although it seemed a good idea at the time. And so I found myself in the <br>streets of Buenos Aires and one thing led to another and here I am.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Won't you have some wine?' Marvin asked. <br>'That's very thoughtful of you,' his mother said, 'but I really must be on my </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">way.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Where?' <br>'To Havana,' his mother said. 'I have a message for Garcia. Marvin, have you </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">a cold?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'No, I probably sound funny because of this bomb in my nose.' <br>'Take care of yourself, Marvin,' his mother said, and hurried on. <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Time passed. Marvin ate his dinner on the portico, washed it down with a flagon <br>of Sangre de Hombre, '36, and settled back in the deep shadow cast by the <br>whitewashed palladium. The sun stretched its golden bottom towards the </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">mountain peaks. Down the road, the figure of a man could be seen hurrying past <br>the inn ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Father!' Marvin cried. <br>'Good afternoon, Marvin,' his father said, startled but hiding it well. 'I must </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">say, you turn up in some unexpected places.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I could say the same of you,' Marvin said. <br>His father frowned, adjusted his necktie and changed his briefcase to the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">other hand. 'There is nothing strange about me being here,' he told his son. <br>'Usually your mother drives me home from the station. But today she was <br>delayed, and so I walked. Since I was walking, I decided to take the shortcut <br>which goes over one side of the golf course.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I see,' Marvin said. <br>'I will admit,' his father continued, 'that this shortcut seems to have become a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">&quot;long&quot; cut, as one might express it, for I estimate that I have been walking <br>through this countryside for the better part of an hour, if not longer.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Dad,' Marvin said, 'I don't know how to tell you this, but the fact is, you are </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">no longer on Earth.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I find nothing humorous about a remark like that,' his father stated. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Doubtless I have gone out of my way; nor is the style of architecture what I <br>would normally expect to find in New York State. But I am quite certain that if I <br>continue along this road for another hundred yards or so, it will lead into <br>Annandale Avenue, which in turn will take me to the intersection of Maple <br>Street and Spruce Lane. From there, of course, I can easily find my way home.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I suppose you're right,' Marvin said. He had never been able to win an </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">argument from his father. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I must be getting along,' his father said. 'By the way, Marvin, were you </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">aware that you have some sort of obstruction in your nose?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Yes sir,' Marvin said. 'It's a bomb.' <br>His father frowned deeply, pierced him with a glance, shook his head </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">regretfully, and marched on down the road. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I don't understand it,' Marvin remarked later to Valdez. 'Why are all of these <br>people finding me? It just doesn't seem natural.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'It isn't natural,' Valdez assured him. 'But it <i>is</i> inevitable, which is much more </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">important.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Maybe it is inevitable,' Marvin said. 'But it is also highly improbable.' <br>'True.' Valdez agreed. 'Although we prefer to call that a forced-probability; </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">which is to say, it is an indeterminate concomitant of the Theory of Searches.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I'm afraid I don't fully understand that,' Marvin said. <br>'Well, it's simple enough. The Theory of Searches is a pure theory; which is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">to say that on paper it works every time, with no conceivable refutation. But <br>once we take the pure and ideal and attempt to make practical applications, we </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">encounter difficulties, the foremost of which is the phenomenon of <br>indeterminacy. To put it in its simplest terms, what happens is this: the presence <br>of the Theory interferes with the working of the Theory. You see, the Theory <br>cannot take into account the effect of its own existence upon itself. Ideally, the <br>Theory of Searches exists in a universe in which there is no Theory of Searches. <br>But practically - which is our concern here - the Theory of Searches exists in a <br>world in which there <i>is</i> a Theory of Searches, which has what we call a <br>&quot;mirroring&quot; or &quot;doubling&quot; effect upon itself. According to some thinkers, there is <br>a very real danger of &quot;infinite duplication&quot;, in which the Theory endlessly <br>modifies itself in terms of prior modifications of the Theory by the Theory, <br>coming at last to a state of entropy, in which all possibilities are equally valued. <br>This argument is known as Von Gruemann's Fallacy, in which the error of <br>implying causality to mere sequence is self-evident. Does it become more clear?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I think so,' Marvin said. 'The only thing I don't understand is, exactly what </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">effect does the existence of the Theory have upon the Theory?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I thought I had explained that,' Valdez said. 'The primary, or &quot;natural&quot; effect </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">of a Theory of Searches upon a Theory of Searches is of course to increase the <br>value of lambda-chi.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Hmm,' said Marvin. <br>'Lambda-chi is, of course, the symbolic representation of the inverse ratio of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">all possible searches to all possible finds. Thus, when lambda-chi is increased <br>through indeterminacy or other factors, the possibility of search-failure is <br>rapidly reduced to a figure near zero, while the possibility of search-success <br>expands quickly towards one. This is known as the Set-Expansion Factor.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Does that mean,' Marvin asked, 'that because of the effect of the Theory of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Searches on the Theory of Searches, which results in the Set-Expansion Factor, <br>that all searches will be successful?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Exactly,' Valdez said. 'You have expressed it beautifully, though perhaps </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">with insufficient rigour. All possible searches will be successful during the time, <br>or duration, of the Set-Expansion Factor.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I understand now,' Marvin said. 'According to the theory, I must find Cathy.' <br>'Yes,' Valdez said. 'You must find Cathy; as a matter of fact, you must find </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">everyone. The only limitation is the Set-Expansion factor, or S-E.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Oh?' Marvin asked. <br>'Well, naturally, all searches can only be successful during the time, or </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">duration, of S-E. But the duration of S-E is a variable which can last no less than <br>6.3 microseconds and no more than 1,005.34543 years.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'How long will S-E last in my particular case?' Marvin asked. <br>'A lot of us would like to know the answer to that one,' Valdez said, with a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">hearty chuckle. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'You mean that you don't know?' <br>'I mean that it has been the labour of several lifetimes simply to discover the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">existence of the Set-Expansion Factor. To determine an exact numerical solution </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">for it for all possible cases would be possible, I suppose, if S-E were a mere <br>variable. But it happens to be a <i>contingent</i> variable, which is a very different <br>kettle of fish. You see, the calculus of contingencies is a rather new branch of <br>mathematics, and one that no one can pretend to have mastered.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I was afraid of that,' Marvin said. <br>'Science is a cruel taskmaster,' Valdez agreed. Then he winked cheerfully and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">said, 'But of course, even the cruellest taskmasters can be evaded.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Do you mean to say there is a solution?' Marvin cried. <br>'Not a legitimate one, unfortunately,' Valdez said. 'It is what we Search </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Theorists call a &quot;bootleg solution&quot;. That is to say, it is a pragmatic application of <br>a formula that, statistically, has had a high degree of correlation with required <br>solutions. But as a theory, there are no rational grounds for presuming its <br>validity.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Still,' Marvin said, 'if it works, let's try it out.' <br>'I would really rather not,' Valdez said. 'Irrational formulae, no matter what </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">their apparent degree of success, are distasteful to me, containing, as they do, <br>distressing hints that the supreme logic of mathematics might be founded <br>ultimately upon gross absurdities.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I insist,' Marvin said. 'After all, I am the one who is Searching.' <br>'That has nothing to do with it, mathematically speaking,' Valdez said. 'But I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">suppose you would give me no peace unless I indulged you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Valdez sighed unhappily, schlepped a piece of paper and a stub pencil out of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">his rebozo, and asked, 'How many coins do you have in your pocket?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin looked and replied, 'Eight.' <br>Valdez wrote down the result, then asked for the date of Marvin's birth, his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">social-security number, his shoe size, and height in centimetres. To this he gave <br>a numerical value. He asked Marvin to pick a number at random between 1 and <br>14. With this, he added several figures of his own, then scribbled and calculated <br>for several minutes. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Well?' Marvin asked. <br>'Remember, this result is merely statistically probable,' Valdez said, 'and has </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">no other grounds for credence.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin nodded. Valdez said, 'The duration of the Set-Expansion Factor, in </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">your particular case, is due to expire in exactly one minute and forty-eight <br>seconds, plus or minus five minimicroseconds.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin was about to protest vehemently about the unfairness of this, and to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">ask why Valdez hadn't made that vital calculation earlier. But then he looked <br>down upon the road, now glowing a singular white against the rich blue of <br>evening. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">He saw a figure moving slowly towards the posada. <br>'Cathy!' Marvin cried. For it was she. <br>'Search completed with forty-three seconds of the Set-Expansion Factor </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">unelapsed,' Valdez noted. 'Another experimental validation of Search Theory.' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">clasped the long-lost beloved in his arms. And Valdez, the wily old friend and <br>taciturn companion of the Long March, smiled tightly to himself and ordered <br>another bottle of wine. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Their happiness was flawed and ennobled. There was the bomb in Marvin's </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">nose, ticking away the inexorable seconds of his destiny, providing a strict <br>metronomic measure for their dance of love. But this sense of foredoomedness <br>caused their opposed destinies to twine closer, and it informed their relationship <br>with grace and meaning. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He created waterfalls for her out of the morning dew, and from the coloured </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">pebbles of a meadow stream he made a necklace more beautiful than emeralds, <br>sadder than pearls. She caught him in her net of silken hair, she carried him <br>down, down, into deep and silent waters, past obliteration. He showed her frozen <br>stars and molten sun; she gave him long, entwined shadows and the sound of <br>black velvet. He reached out to her and touched moss, grass, ancient trees, <br>iridescent rocks; her fingertips, striving upwards, brushed old planets and silver <br>moonlight, the flash of comets and the cry of dissolving suns. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">They played games in which he died and she grew old; they did it for the </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">They were lovers, they could conceive of nothing but love. But some things </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">poked patiently through the little village beyond it. She was gone.

He asked if they had seen a girl fair as the dawn, with hair of <br>indescribable beauty, limbs of a previously unheard-of felicity, features whose <br>comeliness was matched only by their harmony, etc. And those he questioned <br>sadly replied, 'Alas, seÃ±or, we have not seen thees woman, not now or ever in <br>our lives.' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Then a gas-station attendant gave him a hastily scrawled note from Cathy </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">that began, 'Marvin dear, please try to understand and forgive me. As I tried to <br>tell you so many times, it was necessary for me--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The rest of the note was illegible. With the aid of a cryptanalyst, Marvin </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">deciphered the closing words, which were: 'But I shall always love you, and I <br>hope you can find it in your heart to think of me occasionally with kindness. <br>Your Loving Cathy.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The rest of the note, made enigmatic by grief, was unsusceptible to human </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">flight of the heron: both are ineffable and unspeakable. Suffice it to say that <br>Marvin considered suicide, but decided against it, since it seemed entirely too <br>superficial a gesture. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Nothing was enough. Intoxication was merely maudlin, and renunciation of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the world seemed no more than the act of a peevish child. Because of the <br>inadequacy of the attitudes open to him, Marvin struck none. Dry-eyed and <br>zombie-like he moved through his days and nights. He walked, he talked, he <br>even smiled. He was unfailingly polite. But it seemed to his dear friend Valdez <br>that the real Marvin had vanished in an instantaneous explosion of sorrow, and <br>that in his place there walked a poorly modelled representation of a man. Marvin <br>was gone; the ringer who moved in his place looked as if, in its unfailing <br>mimicry of humanness, it might collapse at any moment from strain. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Valdez was both perplexed and dismayed. Never had the wily old Master of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Searches seen such a difficult case. With desperate energy he tried to rally his <br>friend out of his living death. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He tried sympathy: 'I know exactly how you feel, my unfortunate companion, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">for once, when I was quite a young man, I had quite a comparable experience, <br>and I found--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">That did nothing, so Valdez tried brutality: 'Christ damn me for a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">winnieburne, but are ye still mawking abaht after that bit of fluff wot walked out <br>on yer? Now by God's wounds, I tell thee this: there's women past counting in <br>this world of ours, and the man's no man who'd curl himself up in the corner <br>when there's good lovin' to be had without ...' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">No response. Valdez tried eccentric distraction: <br>'Look, look over there, I see three birds on a limb, and one has a knife thrust </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">through its throat and a sceptre clutched in its claw, and yet it sings more merrily <br>than the others! What do you make of it, eh?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin made nothing of it. Undismayed, Valdez tried to rouse his friend by </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">piteous self-referral. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well, Marvin, lad, the medics have taken a look at that skin rash of mine and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">it seems that it's a case of pandemic impetigo. They give me twelve hours on the <br>outside, after that I cash in my chips and make room for another man at the <br>table. But for my last twelve hours, what I'd like to do is--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Nothing. Valdez attempt to stir his friend with peasant philosophy: <br>'The simple farmers know best, Marvin. Do you know what they say? They </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">say that a broken knife makes a poor walking-stick. I think you should bear that <br>in mind, Marvin . . .' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But Marvin absentmindedly did not bear it in mind. Valdez swung to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Hyperstrasian Ethics as expressed in the Timomachaean Scroll: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Thou considerest thyself wounded, then? But consider: Self is Ineffable and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Unitary, and not Susceptible to Externalities. Therefore it is merely a <i>Wound</i> <br>which was <i>Wounded</i>; and this, being External to the Person and Extraneous to <br>the Insight affords no cause for the Implication of Pain.' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin was not swayed by this argument. Valdez turned to psychology: <br>'Loss of the Beloved, according to Steinmetzer, is a ritual re-enactment of the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">loss of the Faecal Self. Therefore, amusingly enough, when we think we mourn <br>the dear departed, we actually are grieving the irreparable loss of our faeces.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But this, too, could not penetrate Marvin's close-held passivity. His </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">melancholic detachment from all human values seemed irrevocable; and this <br>impression was heightened when, one quiet afternoon, his nose ring stopped <br>ticking. It was not a bomb at all; it was merely a warning from Marduk Kras' <br>constituents. And thus Marvin no longer stood in imminent danger of having his <br>head blown off. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But even this stroke of good fortune did nothing to alter his grey robotic </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">spirits. Quite unmoved, he noted the fact of his salvation as one might observe <br>the passing of a cloud from the face of the sun. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Nothing seemed to have any effect upon him. And even the patient Valdez </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">was finally led to explain: 'Marvin, you are a goddamned pain in the ass!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Yet Marvin persevered, unmoved. And it seemed to Valdez and to the good </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">people of San Ramon that this man was beyond human recall. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And yet, how little we know of the twists and turns of the human mind! For </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the very next day, contrary to all reasonable expectations, an event occurred that <br>broke at last through Marvin's reserve, and inadvertently threw wide the <br>floodgates of susceptibility behind which he had been hiding. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">A single event! (Though it was in itself the beginning of yet another chain of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">causality - the quiet opening move in yet another of the uncountable dramas of <br>the universe.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">It began, absurdly enough, with a man's asking Marvin for the time. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>CHAPTER 24 </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">The event occurred on the northem side of the Plaza de los Muertos, shortly <br>after the evening paseo and a full fifteen minutes before matins. Marvin had <br>been taking his customary walk, past the statue of Jose Grimuchio, past the row <br>of bootblacks gathered near the fifteenth-century pewter railing, to the fountain <br>of San Briosci at the eastern corner of the grim little park. He had come even <br>with the Tomb of the Misbegotten when a man stepped into his path and raised <br>an imperious hand. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'A thousand pardons,' the man said. 'This unsolicited interruption of your </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">solitude is regrettable to me, and perhaps offensive to you; yet still it is </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">incumbent upon me to ask if by chance you could tell me the correct time?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">A harmless enough request - on the surface. Yet the man's appearance belied </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">his commonplace words. He was of medium and slight build, and he wore a <br>moustache of outmoded design, of a sort that can be seen in the Grier portrait of <br>King Morquavio Redondo. His clothes were tattered but very clean and neatly <br>pressed, and his cracked shoes were highly polished. On his right forefinger was <br>an ornate signet ring of massy gold; his eyes were the cold hawk eyes of a man <br>used to command. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">His question concerning the time would have been commonplace had there </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">not been clocks facing the plaza, and disagreeing in their separate computations <br>by no more than three minutes. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin answered the man with his usual unfailing politness, glancing at his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">ankle watch and announcing the time as just five past the hour. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Thank you, sir, you are most obliging,' the man said. 'Five past already? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Time devours our feeble mortality, leaving us with but the sour residue of <br>memory.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin nodded. 'Yet this ineffable and ungraspable quantity,' he replied, 'this </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">time which no man may possess, is in truth our only possession.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The man nodded as though Marvin had said something profound, instead of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">merely voicing a well-mannered conversational commonplace. The stranger <br>bent forward into a sweeping bow (more to be seen in a bygone day than in this <br>plebian age of ours). In so doing he lost his balance and would have fallen had <br>not Marvin grasped him strongly and set him upon his feet. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Many thanks, ' the man said, never for a moment losing his poise. 'Your </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">grasp of time and of men is most sure; this shall not be forgotten.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">And with that he whirled and marched away into the crowd. <br>Marvin watched him go, faintly perplexed. Something about the fellow had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">not rung true. Perhaps it was the moustache, patently false, or the thickly <br>pencilled eyebrows, or the artificial wart on the left cheek; or perhaps it was the <br>shoes, which had given an extra three inches to the man's height, or the cloak, <br>which had been padded to augment the natural narrowness of the shoulders. <br>Whatever it was, Marvin found himself bemused, but not immediately <br>distrustful, for beneath the man's rodomontade there had been evidence of a <br>cheerful and sturdy spirit not lightly to be discounted. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">It was while thinking of these things that Marvin happened, by chance, to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">glance down at his right hand. Looking more closely, he saw a piece of paper in <br>the palm. It certainly had not come there by natural means. He realized that the <br>cloaked stranger must have pressed it upon him while stumbling (or, as Marvin <br>realized now, while <i>pretending</i> to stumble). </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">This cast the events of the past few minutes into an entirely different light. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Frowning slightly, Marvin unfolded the paper and read: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>Marvin mused for a considerable time upon that note and its implications. He </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">sensed that in some unimaginable fashion a group of interrelated lives and <br>problems, hitherto unknown to him, had crossed his path. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But now was the moment when he could choose. Did he really care to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">involve himself in anyone's scheme, no matter how noteworthy? Might it not be <br>best to avoid involvement and pursue his own solitary way through the <br>metaphoric deformations of the world? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Perhaps ... yet still, the incident had intrigued him and offered an apparently </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">inconsequential diversion to help him forget the pain of Cathy's loss. (Thus <br>action serves as anodyne, whereas contemplation is revealed as the most direct <br>form of involvement, and therefore much shunned by men.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin followed the instructions given to him in the note from the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">mysterious stranger. He bought a copy of the <i>Diaro de Celsus</i> (4-star edition), <br>and procured a white rosebud for his lapel. And at nine o'clock sharp he went to <br>the Inn of the Hanged Man and sat down at the table in the far left-hand corner, <br>near the paired embrochures. His heart was beating with some rapidity. It was <br>not an entirely unpleasant sensation. </span></nobr></DIV>

A six-<br>legged thorasorous was roasting in the great fireplace, and a scully basted the <br>crackling carcass with honeyed juices. A fiddler had got up on a table and was <br>playing a jig; his wooden leg rattled merrily in time with the old refrain. A <br>drunken strumpet, with jewelled eyelids and artificial septum, wept in a corner <br>with maudlin self-pity. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">A perfumed dandy swept a lace handkerchief to his nose and threw a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">disdainful coin to the tightrope wrestlers. Farther to the left, at the common <br>table, a bootblack reached into the pot for a morsel of scrag, and found his hand <br>skewered to the table by the poniard of a riisman. This exploit was greeted with <br>cheers by the assembled company. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Gawd save'ee, sir, and whut'll thee be drinking?' <br>Marvin looked up and saw a waitress with red cheeks and extensive bosom </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">waiting for his order. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Mead, and it so please you,' Marvin answered quietly. <br>'Aye, that we do be havin',' the girl replied. She bent to adjust her garter and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">whispered to Marvin, 'Lawks, sir, do be mindful of yourself in this place which <br>is in truth no fitten for a young gentleman such as thyself.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Thanks for your warning,' Marvin replied, 'but if it comes to the rub, I hope </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">that I may be allowed to believe that I might not be entirely unavailing.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Ah, ye don't know them as is 'ere,' the girl replied; and then moved away </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">hastily, for a large gentleman dressed entirely in black had approached Marvin's <br>table. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Now by the sweet bleeding wounds of the Almighty and what have we here?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">he shouted. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">A silence fell over the inn. Marvin looked steadily upon the man, and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">recognized in his huge expanse of chest and abnormal reach that one whom <br>people called 'Black Denis'. And he remembered the man's reputation as a ripper <br>and tearer and general bully and spoiler. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin affected not to notice the man's sweaty proximity. Instead, he took </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">out a fan and wafted it gently in front of his nose. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The crowd roared with peasant mirth. Black Denis took a half-step closer. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Muscles along his arm writhed like cobras in travail as his fingers closed on the <br>gaunt handle of his rapier. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Damn me blind for a turnip-filler!' Black Denis shouted, 'but it seems most </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">marvellous to me that we have here in our midst a fellow who looks most <br>exceedingly like a king's spy! </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin suspected that the man was trying to provoke him. Therefore he </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">ignored the sally and buffed his fingernails with a tiny silver file. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well, slash me up the middle and tie me guts for a sash!' Black Denis swore. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Were you addressing me?' Marvin asked, in a suspiciously mild voice. <br>'Indeed I was,' Black Denis said. 'For it came to me of a sudden that me likes </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">not your face.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Indeed?' Marvin lisped. <br>'Aye!' thundered Black Denis. 'Nor like I more your manner, nor the stench </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Aye, spill it!' a dozen other voices roared, taking up the cry. <br>'Gentlemen, please!' said the fat innkeeper, wringing his hands. <br>' 'E ain't never bothered you!' said the frowsy barmaid, a tray of glasses </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">trembling in her hand. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Nay, leave the popinjay to his drink,' said the hunchback, tugging at Black </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Denis' sleeve and drooling from one side of his mouth. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Unhand me, lump-shoulder!' Black Denis shouted, and struck out with a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">right hand the size of a padding mauler. It caught the little hunchback fair across <br>the chest and propelled him across the room, driving him comple across the <br>aleyard table until he fetched up against the cinch rack with a great clatter of <br>broken glass. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Now, by the maggots of eternity!' the huge brawler said, turning to Marvin. <br>Still Marvin fanned himself and sat back in his chair, relaxed but with eyes </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">slightly narrowed. A more observant man might have noticed the faint <br>anticipatory tremor along his thighs, the merest suggestion of flexion in his <br>wrist. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Now he deigned to notice his molester. 'Still here?' he queried. 'Fellow, your </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">importunities grow wearisome to the ear and redundant to the senses.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Yeah?' Black Denis cried. <br>'Yeah,' Marvin replied ironically. 'Reiteration is ever the emphasis of the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">disingenuous; yet it amuses not my fancy. Therefore remove yourself, fellow, <br>and take your overheated carcass somewhere else, lest I cool it for thee by a <br>bloodletting which any chirurgeon might envy.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Black Denis gaped at the effrontery of this deadly quiet insult. Then, with a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">speed which belied his bulk, he swept out his sword and brought it down in a </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">stroke that cleaved the heavy oak table in two, and would have most assuredly <br>done for Marvin had he not moved nimbly out of the way. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Bellowing with rage, Denis charged, swinging his sword like a windmill </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">gone berserk. And Marvin danced lightly back, folded his fan, tucked it away in <br>his belt, rolled up his sleeves, bent low to evade another stroke, leaped <br>backwards over a cedar table, and plucked up a carving knife. Then, gripping the <br>knife lightly in his hand, he moved forward on gliding steps to do combat. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Take flight, sir!' the barmaid cried. 'He'll split 'ee, and 'ee with naught but a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">tinysome table steel in 'ee's hand and it with no great edge on it!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Take care, young man!' the hunchback cried, taking refuge beneath a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">hanging side of bartels. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Spill his guts for him!' the spindly, long-nosed fellow with the piebald eyes </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">cried. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Gentlemen, please!' cried the unhappy landlord. <br>The two combatants were met now in the centre of the common room, and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Black Denis, his face twisted with passion, feinted and swung a cutlass stroke <br>powerful enough to split an oak. Marvin moved with deadly sureness inside of <br>the blow, deflecting it with his knife in <i>quatre</i>, and immediately riposting in <br><i>quinze</i>. This deft counter was blocked only by the abnormal swiftness of Denis' <br><i>revanche</i>, else it would surely have cut the gullet out of the man. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Black Denis came back on to guard, looking upon his opponent with more </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">than a suggestion of respect. Then he roared with berserker rage, and drove <br>forward into the attack, forcing Marvin back across the smoky room. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'A double Napoleon on the big fellow!' cried the perfumed dandy. <br>'Done!' cried the hunchback. 'That slender lad has the footwork, mark it well.' <br>'Footwork ne'er stopped swinging steel e'er now,' the dandy lisped. 'Wilt back </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">thy judgement with thy purse?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Aye! I'll add five Louis d'Or!' said the hunchback, fumbling for his purse. <br>And now others in the crowd had caught the gaming fever. 'Ten rupees on the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Denis!' shouted the long-nosed fellow. 'Nay, I'll offer odds of three to one!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Make it four to one!' cried the ever-cautious landlord, 'and seven to five on </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">first blood!' And so saying, he swept out a bag of gold sovereigns. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Done!' screamed the piebald-eyed fellow, putting up three silver talents and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">a gold half-denarius. 'And by the Black Mother, I'll even offer eight to six on a <br>chest-cut!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I'll take the bet!' shrieked the barmaid, taking a bag of Maria Theresa thalers </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">out of her bosom. 'And I'll give you six-five pick 'em on first amputation!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I'll take that!' the perfumed dandy shrilled. 'And by my wattles, I'll even offer </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">nine to four that the slender lad runs out of here like a scorched greyhound <br>before third blood!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I'll take that bet,' Marvin Flynn said, with an amused smile. Evading Denis' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">clumsy rush he plucked a bag of florins out of his sash and threw it to the dandy. <br>Then he settled down seriously to fight. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Even in these few brief moves, Marvin's skill at fence could clearly be seen. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Yet he was faced with a powerful and determined opponent, who wielded a <br>sword many times larger than Marvin's inadequate weapon, and who seemed <br>determined to the point of madness. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The attack came, and all in the crowd except for the hunchback held their </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">breaths as Black Denis rushed down like an incarnation of Juggernaut. Before <br>that impetuous rush, Marvin was forced to give ground. He backed away, <br>vaulted over a table, found himself wedged into a corner, leaped high and caught <br>the chandelier, swung across the room and dropped lightly to his feet. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Bewildered, and perhaps feeling a shade unsure of himself, Black Denis </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">resorted to a trick. As they came together again, Denis' long arm swept a chair <br>into Marvin's path; and as Marvin dodged, Denis grasped a collard of black <br>Ignean pepper from a table and flung it into Marvin's face ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But Marvin's face was no longer there. Pivoting and driving off his left foot, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin evaded the treacherous tactic. He feinted low with his knife, double-<br>feinted with his eyes, and executed a perfect stepback crossover. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Black Denis blinked stupidly and looked down to see the handle of Marvin's </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">knife jutting from his chest. His eyes opened wide in astonishment, and his <br>sword hand came swinging up to the riposte. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin turned serenely on his heel and walked slowly away, leaving his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">unprotected back exposed to the glint-edged cutlass! </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Black Denis began his downward swing; but already a thin grey film had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">formed over his eyes. Marvin had judged the severity of the wound with <br>exquisite precision, for Black Denis' sword clattered to the floor, to be joined a <br>moment later by the great body of the brawler. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Without looking back, Marvin crossed the room and regained his chair. He <br>opened his fan; then, frowning, he slipped a lace handkerchief out of his pocket <br>and dabbled at his forhead. Two or three drops of perspiration marred its marble <br>perfection. Flynn wiped the drops away, then threw away the handkerchief. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The room was in absolute silence. Even the piebald-eyed man had stopped </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">his stertorous breathing. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">It was perhaps the most amazing exhibition of swordsmanship that the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">inhabitants had ever seen. Brawlers one and all, and calling no man master, still <br>they were impressed. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">A moment later, pandemonium broke loose. All crowded around Marvin, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">cheering and exclaiming, and marvelling at the skill he had shown with pointed <br>steel. The two rope wrestlers (brothers, born deaf-mutes) made squealing noises <br>and turned somersaults; the hunchback grinned and counted his winnings with <br>foam-flecked lips; the barmaid looked at Marvin with an embarrassing excess of <br>ardour; the proprietor gruffly served drinks on the house; the piebald-eyed man <br>snuffled through his long nose and talked about luck; even the perfumed dandy </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">was moved to offer perfunctory congratulations. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Slowly the room returned to normal. Two bull-necked servitors dragged out </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Black Denis' body, and the fickle crowd pelted the corpse with orange peels. <br>The roast was set again to turning on the spit, and the rattle of dice and swish of <br>cards could be heard over the playing of the blind, one-legged fiddler. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The dandy strolled over to Marvin's table and looked down upon him, hand </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">on hip and feathered hat akimbo. ' 'Pon my honour, sir,' the dandy said, 'you do <br>indeed have some qualifications at fence; and it seems to me that your skills <br>could be rewarded in the service of the Cardinal Macchurchi, who is always on <br>the lookout for apt and agile fellows.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I am not for hire,' Marvin said quietly. <br>'I am glad to hear it,' the dandy said. And now, looking at the man more </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">closely, Marvin perceived a white rosebud in his buttonhole, and a copy of the <br><i>Diario de Celsus</i> (4-star edition) in his hand. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The dandy's eyes flashed a warning. In his most effete voice, he said, 'Well </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">then, sir, my congratulations again; and perhaps, if you would care for a bit of <br>sport, you will join me in my chambers on the Avenue of Martyrs. We could <br>discuss the finer points of swordplay, and drink a rather adequate little wine <br>which has lain in my family's vaults for 103 years, and perhaps even hazard <br>another topic or two of mutual interest.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Now Marvin was able to recognize, beneath his disguise, the man who had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">pressed a note into his hand earlier. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Sir,' Marvin said, 'your invitation does me honour.' <br>'Not at all, sir. Your acknowledgement of my invitation does me honour.' <br>'Nay, sir,' Marvin insisted, and would have examined the honour question </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">further had not the man cut short the punctilio and whispered, 'We'll leave at <br>once, then. Black Denis was but a harbinger - a straw to show us which way the <br>wind blows. And I greatly fear, lest we get ourselves promptly hence, it may <br>well blow us a hurricane.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That would be most unfortunate,' Marvin said, grinning very slightly. <br>'Landlord! Set this upon my account!' <br>'Aye, Sir Gules,' the landlord replied, bowing low. <br>And so they went out together into the fog-bound night. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">walls of the Terc Fortress, past the infamous Spodney Asylum, wherein the <br>screams of abused madmen mingled strangely with the squeak of the great <br>waterwheel at Battlegrave Landing; past the howling of prisoners in the squat <br>and ominous Donjon of the Moon, and then past the malodorous High <br>Battlement with its grisly row of spiked torsos. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Being men of their time and age, neither Marvin nor Sir Gules gave notice to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">these sounds and sights. Quite unmoved they walked past the Garbage Pond <br>wherein the former regent had gratified his mad nocturnal fancies; and without a <br>glance they went by Lion's Gambit, where petty debtors and child malefactors <br>were buried headfirst in quick-setting cement as an example to others. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">It was a hard age, and some might consider it a cruel age. Manners were </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">refined, but passions ran unchecked. The most exquisite punctilio was observed; <br>but death by torture was the common lot of most. It was an age in which six out <br>of seven women died in childbirth; in which infant mortality was a shocking 87 <br>per cent: in which the average life-expectancy was no more than 12.3 years; in <br>which the Plague yearly ravaged the central city, carrying away an estimated <br>two-thirds of the population; in which continual religious warfare halved the <br>able-bodied male population every year - to the point where some regiments <br>were forced to use blind men as gunnery officers. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And yet, it could not be considered an unhappy age. Despite difficulties, the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">population soared to new heights every year, and men aspired to fresh extremes <br>of audacity. If life was uncertain, it was at least interesting. Machinery had not <br>bred individual initiative out of the race as yet. And though there were shocking <br>class differences and feudal privilege reigned supreme, checked only by the <br>dubious power of the king and the baleful presence of the clergy, still it could <br>fairly be called a democratic age and a time of individual opportunity. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But neither Marvin nor Sir Gules were thinking of these things as they </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">approached a narrow old house with drawn shutters and a brace of horses posted <br>near the door. They were not contemplating individual enterprise, though indeed <br>they were engaged in it; nor did they consider death, though it surrounded them <br>constantly. Theirs was not a self-conscious age. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Well then,' Sir Gules said, leading his guest down the carpeted floor past the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">silent manservants to a high wainscotted room in which a cheery fire snapped <br>and crackled in the great onyx fireplace. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin did not answer. His eye was taking in the details of the room. The </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">carven armoire was surely tenth century, and the portrait on the west wall, half-<br>hidden by its gilt frame, was a genuine Moussault. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Come, sit, I pray thee,' said Sir Gules, sinking gracefully to a David Ogilvy </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">half-couch decorated in the Afghan brocade so popular that year. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Thank you,' Marvin said, sitting upon an eight-legged John IV with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">rosewood handles and a backing of heart-o'-palm. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'A little wine?' Sir Gules said, handling with casual reverence the bronze </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">decanter with gold chasings engraved by Dagobert of Hoyys. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Not just at the moment, give thee thanks,' Marvin replied, brushing a fleck of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">dust from his stuff-coloured outercoat of green baptiste with lisle froggings, <br>made to his measure by Geoffrey of Palping Lane. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Then mayhap a touch of snuff?' Sir Gules inquired, profferring his small </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">platinum snuffbox made by Durr of Snedum, upon which was portrayed in steel-<br>point a hunting scene from the Orange Forest of Lesh. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Perhaps later,' Marvin said, squinting down at the double-furled silver thread </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">laces on his dancing pumps, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'My purpose in bringing you here,' his host said abruptly, 'was to inquire as to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the availability of your aid to a cause both good and righteous, and with which <br>you are not, I believe, entirely unacquainted. I refer to the Sieur Lamprey Height <br>d'Augustin, better known as The Enlightened.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'D'Augustin!' Marvin exclaimed. 'Why, I knew him when I was little more </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">than a lad, in '02 or '03, the year of the Speckled Plague! Why, he used to visit at <br>our chalet! I can still remember the marzipan apples he used to bring me!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I thought you would remember him,' Gules said quietly. 'All of us do.' <br>'And how is that great and good gentleman?' <br>'Well enough - we hope.' <br>Marvin was instantjy alert. 'Your meaning, sir?' <br>'Last year, d'Augustin was working on his country estate at Duvannemor, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">which is just beyond Moueur d'AlenÃ§on in the foothills of the Sangrela.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I know the place,' Marvin said. <br>'He was finishing his masterwork, <i>The Ethics of Indecision</i>, with which he </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">has travailled himself these past twenty years. When suddenly, a host of armed <br>men burst into the Rune Study where he was working, having overpowered his <br>servants and bribed his personal bodyguard. No one else was present save his <br>daughter, who was helpless to interfere. These nameless men seized and bound <br>d'Augustin, burned all extant copies of his book, and took him away.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Infamous!' cried Marvin. <br>'His daughter, witnessing so horrid a sight, swooned away into a lassitude so </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">complete that it resembled death; and thus, through an inadvertent counterfeit, <br>she was spared from death itself.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Shocking!' muttered Marvin. 'But who would let slip violence upon a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">harmless scribbler whom many call the outstanding philosopher of our day and <br>age?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Harmless, say thee?' Sir Gules inquired, his lips quirking into a painful </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">grimace. 'Are you then acquainted with d'Augustin's work that you say so?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I have had not the privilege of acquaintance,' Marvin said. 'My life, in truth, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">has availed me little opportunity for such matters, since I have been travelling <br>continually for some such time now. But I thought that the writings of so gentle <br>and esteemed a man would surely--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I beg to differ,' Sir Gules said. 'This fine and upright old man whom we are </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">put forth certain doctrines which, if they were popularly known, might well <br>cause bloody revolution.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'That scarce seems a goodly matter,' Marvin replied coldy. 'Wouldst teach me </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">damnable sedition?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Nay, softly, softly! These doctrines which d'Augustin proclaims are not so </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">shocking in themselves, but rather, in their consequences. That is to say, they <br>take on the timbre of Moral Facticity, and are no more truly seditious than is the <br>monthly wax and wane of th' moon.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Well ... give me an example,' Marvin said. <br>'D'Augustin proclaims that men are born free,' Gules said softly. <br>Marvin thought about that. 'A new-fangled notion,' he declared at last, 'but </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">not without its suasion. Tell me more.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'He declares that upright conduct is meritorious and pleasing in the eyes of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">God.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'A strange way of looking at things,' Marvin decided. 'And yet - hmmm.' <br>'He also holds that unexamined life is not worth living.' <br>'Quite a radical point of view,' Marvin said. 'And it is, of course, obvious </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">what would happen were these statements to fall into the hands of the populace <br>at large. The authority of king and church would inevitably be undermined ... <br>and yet - and yet--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Yes?' Gules prompted softly. <br>'And yet,' Marvin said, gazing dreamily at the terracotta ceiling with its </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">inscriblature of interlocked palladiums, 'and yet might not a new order arise out <br>of the chaos which would unerringly ensue? Might not a new world be born in <br>which the overweening humours of the nobility would be checked and <br>ameliorated by the concept of personal worth, and in which the thundering <br>threats of a church gone base and political would be countered by a new <br>relationship between a man and his God unmediated by fat priest or larcenous <br>friar?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Do you really think that is possible?' Gules asked, in a voice like silk sliding </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">over velvet. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Yes,' Marvin said. 'Yes, by the hangnails of God, I so do believe! And I will </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">aid you in rescuing d'Augustin and in disseminating this strange and <br>revolutionary new doctrine!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Thank you,' Gules said simply. And he made a gesture with his hand, <br>A figure glided out from behind Marvin's chair. It was the hunchback. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin caught the deadly wink of steel as the creature sheathed his knife. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'No insult intended,' Gules said earnestly. 'We were sure of you, of course. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">But had you found our plan repugnant, it would have been incumbent upon us to <br>hide our poor judgement in an unmarked grave.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'The precaution lends point to your story,' Marvin said dryly. 'But me likes it </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">not such keen appreciation.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Such confabulation is our common lot in life,' the hunchback quoth. 'And </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">indeed, did not the Greeks consider it better to die in the hands of friends than to <br>languish in the claws of enemies? Our roles are chosen for us in this world by <br>the stern dictates of an unrelenting Fate; and many a man who thought to play <br>the emperor on Life's stage found himself cast for a corpse instead.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Sir,' said Marvin, 'you sound to me a man who has experienced some casting </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">problems himself.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'One well might say so,' the hunchback replied dryly. 'I would not of myself </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">have selected this lowly part, had not exigencies beyond prediction forced me to <br>it.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">So saying, the hunchback reached down and unstrapped his legs, which had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">been bound to his thighs, and thereby rose to his full height of six feet one. He <br>unfastened the hump from his back, wiped greasepaint and drool from his face, <br>combed his hair, detached his beard and his club foot, then turned to Marvin <br>with a wry smile upon his face. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin stared at this man transformed; then bowed low and exclaimed. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Milord Inglenook bar na Idrisi-san, first lord of the Admiralty, Familiar to the <br>Prime Minister, Adviser Extraordinary to the King, Bludgeon of the Church <br>Rampant and Invocateur of the Grand Council!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I am that person,' Inglenook responded. 'And I play the hunchback for </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">reasons most politic; for were my presence even suspected here by my rival, <br>Lord Blackamoor de Mordevund, all of us would be dead men ere the frogs in <br>the Pond Royal had chance to croak at first ray of Phoebus!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'This ivy of conspiracy doth grow on high towers,' Marvin commented. 'I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">surely will serve you and God give me strength, unless some tavern brawler lets <br>light into my belly with a yard of steel.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'If you refer to the incident of Black Denis,' Sir Gules said, 'I can assure you </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">that the matter was staged for the eyes of whatever spies Sir Blackamoor might <br>have set upon us. In actuality, Black Denis was one of us.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Wonder upon wonders!' Marvin declared. 'This octopus, it seems, has many </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">tentacles. But gentlemen, it wonders me why, of all puissant gentlemen in this <br>our kingdom, you sought out one who boasts no special privilege nor high <br>position nor monetary wealth nor nothing save the title of gentleman under God <br>and lord of his own honour and bearer of a thousand-year-old name.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'You are reckless in your modesty!' Lord Inglenook laughed. 'For it is known </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">among all that your skill in the fenceyard is unsurpassed, except perhaps for the <br>wily swordplay of the detestable Blackamoor.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I am but a student of the steely art,' Marvin replied carelessly. 'Yet still, if </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">my poor gift will serve you, sobeit. And now, gentlemen, what would you of <br>me?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Our plan,' Inglenook said slowly, 'has the virtue of great daring, and the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">defect of immense danger. A single cast of the dice wins all, or loses us the <br>wager of our lives. A grave gamble! And yet, methinks you would not like not <br>this hazard.' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin smiled while construing the sentence, then said, 'A quick game is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">ever a lively one.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Excellent!' breathed Gules, rising to his feet. 'We must take ourselves now to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Castelgatt in the valley of the Romaine. And during the ride there, we shall <br>acquaint you with the details of our scheme.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And so it was that, muffled in their greatcloaks, the three departed the high </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">narrow house by the dormer stairwell, walking past the chain locker to the <br>postern gate by the old west wall. Here, posted and waiting, was a coach and <br>four, with two armed guards mounted on the slackrails. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin made to enter the coach and saw a person already within. It was a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">girl; and peering more closely, he saw-- </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Cathy!' he cried. <br>She looked at him without comprehension, and answered in a cold, imperious </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">voice, 'Sir, I am Catarina d'Augustin, and I know not your face nor like I your <br>style of presumed familiarity.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There was no recognition in her beautiful grey eyes, and no time to ask </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">questions. For even as Sir Gules made hasty introductions, a shout could be <br>heard behind them. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'You there, in the coach! Halt in the name of the King!' <br>Glancing back, Marvin could see a captain of dragoons with ten mounted </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">men behind him. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Treachery!' shouted Inglenook. 'Quick, coachmen, let us away!' <br>With a clatter of traces and a rattle of bits, the four matched stallions </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">propelled the coach down the narrow alley in the direction of Ninestones and <br>Oceansideways High Road. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Can they overtake us?' asked Marvin. <br>'Mayhap,' Inglenook said. 'They seem damnably well mounted, damn their </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">blue blistered backsides! Your pardon, madame ...' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">For a few moments Inglenook watched the horsemen clatter along not twenty </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">yards behind, their sabres glittering in the dim lamplight. Then he shrugged and <br>turned away. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Let me inquire,' Inglenook inquired, 'as to whether you are conversant with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">recent political developments here and elsewhere in the Old Empire; for this <br>knowledge is needful to make intelligible to you the necessity for the particular <br>form and moment of our scheme.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I fear that my political knowledge is but indifferent poor,' Marvin said. <br>'Then permit me to relate to you a few details of the background, which will </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">render the situation and its import more malleable to the intelligence.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin settled back, hearing the drumming of the dragoon's horses in his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">ears. Cathy, seated opposite him and slightly to his right, stared coldly at the <br>swinging tassels on Sir Gules' hat. And Lord Inglenook began to speak: </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br> <br> <br>CHAPTER 27 <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'The old king died less than a decade ago, at the full flood of the Suessian <br>heresy, leaving no clear successor to the throne of Mulvavia. Thus, the passions <br>of a troubled continent came ominously to the boil. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Three claimants jostled for the Butterfly Throne. Prince Moroway of Theme </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">held the Patent Obvious, which had been awarded him by a bribed but still <br>official Council of Electionate. And if that were not sufficient, he held as well <br>by the doctrine of Regal Empleatude, since he was the acknowledged, <br>illegitimate second (and only surviving) son of Baron Norway, the old king's <br>sister's half-cousin through the powerful Mortjoys of Danat. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'In less troubled times, this might have been sufficient. But for a continent on </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the verge of civil and religious war, there were defects in the claim, and even <br>more in the claimant. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Prince Moroway was merely eight years old and had never been known to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">utter a word. According to the portrait by Mouvey, he had a monstrously <br>swollen head, a slack jaw, and the unfocused eyes of a hydrocephalic idiot. His <br>only known pleasure was his collection of worms (the finest on the continent). </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'His main opposition for the succession was Gottlieb Hosstratter, Duke of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Mela and Receiptor-in-Ordinary of the Imperial Marginland, whose dubious <br>bloodlines were backed by the schismatic Suessian Hierarchy, and most <br>particularly by the enfeebled Hierarch of Dodessa. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'A second claimant, Romrugo of Vars, might have been discounted were it </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">not that he backed his petition with a force of fifty thousand battle-hardened <br>troopers from the southern principality of Vask. Young and vigorous, Romrugo <br>had a reputation for eccentricity; his marriage to his favourite mare Orsilla, was <br>condemned by the orthodox Owensian clergy of which he was the absentminded <br>champion. Nor did he win favour among the burghers of Gint-Loseine, whose <br>proud city he ordered buried under twenty feet of earth &quot;as a gift to future <br>archaeologists&quot;. Yet withal, his claim to the throne of Mulvavia might have been <br>speedily legitimized had he possessed the wherewithal with which to pay his <br>fighting men. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Unfortunately for Romrugo, he had no personal fortune. (It had been </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">squandered upon the purchase of the Lethertean scrolls.) Therefore, in order to <br>raise his army's payroll, he proposed an alliance with the wealthy but ineffectual <br>Free City of Tihurrue, which commanded the straits of Sidue. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'This unthinking move brought down upon his head the wrath of the Duchy </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">of Puls, whose western frontier had long guarded the exposed flank of the Old <br>Empire from the depradations of the pagan Monogoths. The stern, singleminded </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">young grandduke of Puls immediately joined forces with the schismatic <br>Hosstratter - surely as strange an alliance as the continent had ever seen - and <br>thus became a direct menace to Prince Moroway, and to the Mortjoys of Danat <br>who supported him. So, quite unexpectedly, finding himself surrounded on three <br>sides by Suessians or their allies, and on the fourth side by the restive <br>Monogoths, Romrugo began casting around desperately for a new alliance. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'He found it in the enigmatic figure of Baron Lord Darkmouth, Prepossessor </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">of the Isle of Turplend. The tall and brooding Baron set to sea at once with a <br>battle fleet of twenty-five galleons, and all Mulvavia held its breath as the <br>ominous line of ships sailed down the Dorter and into the Escher Sea. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Could the balance still have been preserved, even at this late hour? Perhaps, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">if Moroway had held firm to his former pledges to the Marche Cities. Or if the <br>old Hierarch of Dodessa, contemplating at last the necessity of an <br>accommodation with Hosstratter, had not chosen that inappropriate moment to <br>die, and thus to give power to the epileptic Murvey of Hunfutmouth. Or if Red <br>Hand Ericmouth, chief of the West Monogoths, had not chosen that moment to <br>banish Propeia, sister of the stern Archduke of Puls, known as the &quot;Hammer <br>against Heretics&quot; (by which he meant all who did not subscribe to his own <br>narrowly orthodox Delongianism). </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'But the hand of Fate intervened to stay the inevitable moment; for Baron </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Darkmouth's galleons were caught in the Great Storm of '03, and driven to take <br>refuge at Tihurrue, which they sacked, thus dissolving Romrugo's alliance <br>before it was fairly underway, and causing revolt among the unpaid Vaskians of <br>his army, who deserted by regiments and joined Hosstratter, whose lands lay <br>closest to their line of march. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Thus Hosstratter, third and most reluctant of the royal petitioners, who had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">become resigned to his loss, found himself back in the contest; and Moroway, <br>whose star had glittered high, discovered that the Echilides Mountains were no <br>protection when the eastern passes were held by a determined enemy. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'The man most affected by all of this, of course, was Romrugo. His position </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">was unenviable: deserted by his troops, forsworn by his ally Baron Darkmouth <br>(who had his hands full trying to hold Tihurrue against a determined attack by <br>the pirates of the Rullish coast), and menaced even in his fiefdom of Vars by the <br>long and deadly arm of Mortjoy's conspiracy, while the Marche Cities looked <br>hungrily on. As capstone to his pillar of ill fortune, his mare Orsilla chose that <br>moment to desert him. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Yet even in the depths of adversity, the self-confident Romrugo did not </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">falter. His mare's desertion was hailed by the frightened Owensain clergy, who <br>granted their dubious champion a Divorce in Absolute, and then learned to their <br>horror that the cynical Romrugo intended to use his freedom to wed Propeia and <br>thus align himself with the grateful Archduke of Puls ... </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'These were the factors that exercised men's passions in that fateful year. The </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">continent stood poised upon the brink of catastrophe. Peasants buried their crops </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">underground and sharpened their scythes. Armies stood to attention and <br>prepared to move in any direction. The turbulent mass of the West Monogoths, <br>pressed from behind by the still more turbulent mass of hard-riding cannibal <br>Allahuts, massed threateningly on the borders of the Old Empire. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Darkmouth hastened to re-equip his galleys, and Hosstratter paid the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Vaskian troopers and trained them for a new kind of war. Romrugo cemented <br>his new alliance with Puls, achieved a dÃ©tente with Ericmouth, and took account <br>of the new rivalry between Mortjoy and the epileptic but dourly able Murvey. <br>And Moroway of Theme, unconscious ally of the Rullish pirates, unwilling <br>champion of the Suessian heresy, and unwitting accomplice of Red Hand <br>Ericmouth, looked to the grim eastern slopes of the Echilides and waited in <br>trepidation. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'It was at this moment of supreme and universal tension that Milord </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">d'Augustin all unwittingly chose to announce the imminent completion of his <br>work of philosophy ...' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Inglenook's voice faded slowly away, and for a time there was no sound but the <br>heavy thrum of horse's hooves. Then Marvin said quietly, 'I understand now.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I knew you would,' Inglenook answered warmly. 'And in light of this, you </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">can understand our plan, which is to assemble at Castelgatt and then strike <br>immediately.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin nodded. 'Under the circumstances there could be no other way.' <br>'But first,' Inglenook said, 'we must rid ourselves of these pursuing dragoons.' <br>'As to that,' Marvin said, 'I have a plan ...' <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>CHAPTER 28 </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">By a clever ruse, Marvin and his compatriots were able to elude the pursuing <br>dragoons and to come unscathed into the great moated tiltyard of Castelgatt. <br>There, upon the sounding of the twelfth hour, the conspirators were to assemble, <br>make final dispositions, and move out that very night for the audacious attempt <br>to rescue d'Augustin from the formidable grasp of Blackamoor. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin retired to his chambers in the high east wing, and there shocked his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">page by insisting upon a basin of water in which to wash his hands. It was <br>considered a strange affectation on his part in that age in which even the greatest <br>court ladies were accustomed to hide smudges of dirt under perfumed gauze </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">bandages. But Marvin had picked up the custom during his stay among the gay <br>and pagan Tescos of the southern Remoueve, whose soapy fountains and spongy <br>sculpture were wonders of wonders to the complacent and grimy northern <br>nobility. And in spite of the laughter of his peers and the frowns of the clergy, <br>Marvin stubbornly insisted that an occasional scrub of the hands did no damage, <br>so long as the water touched no other part. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">His ablutions completed, and clad only in black satin half-knickers, white </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">lace shirt, cavalry boots and shoulder-length gloves of Eretzian chamois, and <br>wearing only his sword Coueur de Stabbat, which had been handed down in his <br>family father-to-son for five hundred years, Marvin heard a half-noise behind <br>him and whirled, hand to hilt. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'La, sir, wouldst run me through with thy terrible great sword?' mocked the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Lady Catarina - for it was she - standing just inside the panelled doorway to the <br>inner chamber. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Faith, your ladyship startled me,' Marvin said. 'But as for running thee </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">through, that indeed I wouldst do right merrily, though not with sword but with a <br>trustier weapon which it happens I do possess.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Fie, sir,' the Lady Catarina said mockingly. 'Offerest violence to a lady?' <br>'Merely the violence of pleasure,' Marvin replied gallantly. <br>'Your words are too glib by half,' said the Lady Catarina. 'I believe it has </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">been noted that the longest and wiliest tongues conceal the shortest and least <br>adequate of Weapons.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Your ladyship does me injustice,' Marvin said. 'For I dare say my Weapon is </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">eminently capable of the uses it may encounter, sharp enough to penetrate the <br>best defence in the world, and durable enough for repeated stabbings. And, quite <br>apart from such utilitarian uses, it has learned from me certain infallible tricks, <br>the which it would be my respectful pleasure to show your ladyship.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Nay, keep your Weapon in its scabbard,' the lady quoth, indignantly, but </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">with sparkling eyes. 'Me likes not the sound of 't; for braggart's steel is ever <br>pliable tin, shiny to the eye yet damnably malleable to the touch.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I beg of thee but to touch the edge and point,' Marvin said, 'and thus submit </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">thy raillery to th' test of Usage.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">She shook her pretty head. 'Know, sir, that such Pragmatics are for greybeard </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">philosophers with rheumy eyes; a lady relies upon her intuition.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Lady, I worship thy intuition,' Marvin responded. <br>'Why, sir, what wouldst Thou, the Prepossessor of a dubious Weapon of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">indetermined length and uncertain temper, know of a woman's intuition?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Lady, my heart tells me that it is exquisite and ineffable, and possessed of a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">pleasing shape and delicate fragrance, and that--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Enough, sir!' the Lady Catarina cried, blushing hotly and fanning herself </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">furiously with a Japanese fan whose corrugated surface portrayed the Investiture <br>of the Iichi. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Both fell silent. They had been conversing in the old Language of Courtly </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Love, in which symbolic apostrophe played so important a part. In those days it <br>was deemed no breach of the etiquette for even the best-bred and most demure <br>of young ladies to thus converse; theirs was not a frightened age. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But now a shadow of seriousness had fallen over the two participants. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin glowered, fingering the grey steel buttons of his white lace shirt. And <br>the Lady Catarina looked troubled. She wore a panelled gown of dove tulip with <br>slashings of chrome red; and, as was the custom, the neckline was cut <br>fashionably low to reveal the firm rosy swelling of her little abdomen. Upon her <br>feet were sandal-pumps of ivory-coloured damask; and her hair, piled high upon <br>a jade ratouelle, was adorned with a garland of spring snippinies. Never in his <br>life had Marvin seen so beautiful a sight. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Can we not cease this ceaseless play of word-foolery?' Marvin asked quietly. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'May we not say that which is in our hearts, 'stead of fencing thus with heartless <br>ingenuities?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I dare not!' the Lady Catarina murmured. <br>'And yet, you are Cathy, who loved me once in another time and place,' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin said inexorably, 'and who now plays me for the unacknowledged <br>gallant.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'You must not speak of that which once had been,' Cathy said, in a frightened </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">whisper. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Yet still you loved me once!' Marvin cried hotly. 'Deny me this an you find it </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">false!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Yes,' she said in a failing voice. 'I loved thee once.' <br>'And now?' <br>'Alas!' <br>'But speak and tell me reason!' <br>Nay, I cannot!' <br>'Will not, rather.' <br>'As thee wish; the choice is servant to the heart.' <br>'I would not have you believe that,' she said softly. <br>'No? Then surely the desire is father to the intent,' Marvin said, his face gone </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">hard and pitiless. 'And standing thus in familial relationship, not even the wisest <br>of men would deny that Love is inbonded to its half-sister Indifference, and <br>Faithfulness is thrall to the cruel stepmother, Pain.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Can you so consider me?' she cried weakly. <br>'Why, Lady, you leave me choiceless,' Marvin responded in a voice of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">ringing bronze. 'And thus my barque of Passion is Derelict upon a Sea of <br>Memory, blown off its rightful course by the fickle wind of Indifference, and <br>driven towards the rockbound Coast of Agony by the inexorable Tide of Human <br>Events.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'And yet, I would not have it thus,' Catarina said, and Marvin thrilled to hear </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">even so mild an affirmation of that which he had considered lost beyond recall. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Cathy--' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Nay, it cannot be,' she cried, recoiling in evident agony, her colour high and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">her abdomen rising and falling with the emotion within her. 'You know not of <br>the wretched circumstances of my situation.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I demand to know!' Marvin cried, then whirled, his hand darting to his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">sword. For the great oaken door of his chamber had swung noiselessly open, and <br>there, leaning negligently in the doorway, a man stood with arms folded over his <br>chest and a half-smile playing across his thin, bearded lips. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'In faith! We are undone!' Catarina cried, her hand pressed to her trembling </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">abdomen. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Sir, what would thou?' Marvin asked hotly. 'I demand to know thy name, and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the reason for this most ungentle and unseemly investiture!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'All shall be speedily revealed thee,' the man in the doorway said, his voice </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">revealing a faint and menacing lisp. 'My name, sir, is Lord Blackamoor, 'gainst <br>whom your puerile plans have been cast; and I have entered this chamber from <br>simple privilege of one who dutifully desires introduction to his wife's young <br>friend.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Wife?' Marvin echoed. <br>'This lady,' Blackamoor declared, 'who has the uncertain habit of not </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">straightaways introducing herself, is indeed the Most Noble Catarina d'Augustin <br>di Blackamoor, the most loving wife to this your humble servant.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And so saying, Blackamoor swept off his hat and louted low, then resumed </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">his exquisite's pose in the doorway. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin read the truth in Cathy's tear-stained eyes and shuddering abdomen. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Cathy, his beloved Cathy, the wife of Blackamoor, the most detested enemy of <br>those who espoused the cause of d'Augustin, who was Cathy's own father! </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Yet there was no time to consider these strange propinquities of sensibility; </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">for the foremost consideration was of Blackamoor himself, standing <br>miraculously within a castle held by his enemies, and betraying no hint of <br>nervousness at a position that should have been perilous in the extreme. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And this infallibly meant that the situation was not as Marvin had supposed </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">it, and that the threads of destiny were tangled now past his immediate <br>comprehension. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Blackamoor in Castelgatt? Marvin considered the implications, and a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">sensation of cold came over him, as though the angel of death had brushed past <br>him with stygian wings. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Murder lurked in this room - but for whom? Marvin feared the worst, but </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">turned quite steadily, his face a mask of obsidian, and faced the enemy who was <br>his beloved's husband and the captor of her father. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>CHAPTER 29 </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5"> <br>Milord Lamprey di Blackamoor stood silent and at his ease. He was above </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">the middling height, and possessed a frame of extreme emaciation, punctuated <br>by his narrow, closely cropped beard of jetty black, his deep-swept sideburns, <br>and his hair cut <i>en brosse</i> and allowed to fall upon his forehead in snaky <br>ringlets. And yet the appearance of narrowness was offset by the breadth of <br>shoulder and the powerful swordsman's arm that could be glimpsed beneath his <br>half-cloak of ermitage. He wore his points and josses in the new foppish style, <br>interlaced with macedium pointings and relieved only by a triple row of crepe-<br>silver darturs. His face was coldly handsome, marred only by a puckered scar <br>that ran from his right temple to the left corner of his mouth, and which he had <br>defiantly painted a fiery crimson. This lent to his sarcastic features a look both <br>sinister and absurd. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'It would seem,' Blackamoor drawled, 'that we have played this farce long </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">enough. The denouement approaches.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Does milord then have his third act prepared?' Marvin inquired steadily. <br>'The actors have been given their cues,' Blackamoor said. Negligently he </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">snapped his fingers. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Into the room walked Milord Inglenook, followed by Sir Gules and a platoon </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">of sour-faced Thuringian soldiery in plain deal-coloured half-jackets of buff, <br>with sword-mattocks at the ready. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What damnable entrapment is this?' Marvin demanded. <br>'Tell him - brother,' Blackamoor mocked. <br>'Yes, it is true,' Lord Inglenook said, his face ashen. 'Blackamoor and I are </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">half-brothers, since our common mother was the Marquesita Roseata of Timon, <br>daughter to the Elector of Brandeis and sister-in-marriage to Longsword <br>Silverblain, who was father to Red Sword Ericmouth, and whose first husband, <br>Marquelle of the Marche, was father to me, but after whose decease wed <br>Huntford, Bastard Royal of Cleve and Pretender to the Eleactiq Preserve.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'His outmoded sense of honour rendered him sensible to my scheme and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">ductile to the veriest suggestion,'. Blackamoor sneered. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'A strange state of affairs,' Marvin mused, 'when a man's honour dishonours a </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">man.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Inglenook bent his head and said nothing. <br>'But as for you, milady,' Marvin said, addressing Cathy, 'it mazes me past </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">comprehension why you should choose marriage with the captivator of your <br>father.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Alas,' Cathy said, 'it is a most diverse and noisome tale, for he courted me </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">with threats and indifference, and captivated me by the dark power he doth <br>possess which none oppose; and further, by the use of damnable drugs and <br>double-edged words and sly skilful movements of his hands he did bemuse my <br>sense to a state of counterfeit passion, wherein I seemed to swoon for touch of </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">his damnable body and nibblature of his detestable lips. And since I was denied <br>the comforts of religion during this period, and therefore had no way of knowing <br>the true from the induced, I did indeed succumb. Nor do I offer any excuse of <br>attenuation for myself.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin turned to the man who was his last remaining hope. 'Sir Gules!' he </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">cried. 'Put hand to sword and we shall yet hew our way to freedom!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Blackamoor laughed dryly. 'Think you he'll draw? Mayhap. But 'twill be but </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">to peel an apple, or so I deem!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin stared into the face of his friend, and saw written there a shame </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">deeper than steel and deadlier than poison. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'It is true,' Sir Gules said, trying to keep his voice steady. 'I cannot aid thee, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">though my heart breaks at your plight.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What damnable sorcery has Blackamoor rendered upon you?' Marvin cried. <br>'Alas, my good friend,' said the hapless Gules, 'it is a knavery so clearcut and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">so logical as to be irrefutable; and yet so cunning wrought and executed as to <br>make lesser schemes of littler men seem very foolings of most childlike boys ... <br>Did you know that I am a member of that secret organization known as the Grey <br>Knights of the Holy Subsidence?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Me knew this not,' Marvin said. 'And yet, the Grey Knights have ever been </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">friends to learning and companions to piety, and most especially they have <br>espoused 'gainst royal opposition, the cause of d'Augustin.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'True, most extremely true,' the miserable Gules said, his weakly handsome </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">features twisted into a grimace of agony. 'And so I too believed. But then last <br>day yesterweek I learned that our Grand Master Helvetius had passed away--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Due to a bit of steel in the liver,' Blackamoor said. <br>'--and that I was now bound to the new Grand Master, as utterly and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">completely as ever, since our vows are to the Office, not the man.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'And that new Master?' Marvin asked. <br>'Happens to be myself!' cried Blackamoor. And now Marvin saw upon his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">finger the great signet ring of the Order. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Yes, so it did befall,' Blackamoor said, the left side of his mouth twisting </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">cynically. 'I appropriated that ancient office, since it was an instrument well <br>suited to my hand and sensible to my usages. And so I am Master, and sole <br>arbiter of Polity and Decision-Making, responsible to no power save that of Hell <br>itself, and answerable to no voice save that which echoes from the nethermost <br>crevices of mine own soul!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There was something magnificent about Blackamoor at that moment. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Detestable and cruel though he was, reactionary and self-involved, luxuriating <br>and careless of others, yet still withal, here was a man. So Marvin thought, with <br>grudging respect. And his mouth hardened into fighting lines as he turned to <br>face his antagonist. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'And now,' Blackamoor said, 'our principals are upon the stage, and we lack </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">but one actor to fulfill our drama and bring it to a meet concludence. And this, </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">our last performer, has long and patiently waited in the wings, observing yet <br>unobserved, watching the convolutions of our situation and awaiting his cue to <br>bring him on for his brief moment of glory ... But soft, he comes!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">There was a sound of heavy footsteps in the corridor. Those within the room </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">listened and waited, shuffling uneasily. Slowly the door swung open-- </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And there entered a masked man, clad in black from tip to toe, and carrying </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">over his shoulder a great double-edged axe. He stood poised in the doorway as <br>though unsure of his welcome. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Goodday to you, executioner,' Blackamoor drawled. 'Now all is complete, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">and the final moments of this farce can be performed. Forward, guards!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The guards closed in the locked sword-mattocks. They seized Marvin and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">gripped him fast, bending his head forward with neck exposed. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Executioner!' cried Blackamoor. 'Perform your duty!' <br>The executioner stepped forward and tested the edges of his great axe. He </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">drew the weapon high over his head, stood poised for a moment, then began his <br>downward swing. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">And Cathy screamed! <br>She threw herself upon that grim masked figure, clawing at him, deflecting </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">his heavy axe, which clashed against the granite floor and drew a shower of <br>sparks. The axeman pushed her angrily away, but her fingers had closed around <br>the black silk of his mask. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The executioner roared as he felt the mask being torn away. With a cry of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">dismay he tried to cover his features. But all in that dungeon room had seen him <br>clear. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin was at first unable to believe the testimony of his senses. For, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">beneath that mask, he looked into a face that seemed somehow familiar. Where <br>had he gazed upon that line of cheek and brow, those brown eyes with their faint <br>tilt, that firm jaw? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Then he remembered; he had seen it, long ago, in a mirror. <br>The executioner was wearing his face, and walking in his body ... <br>'Ze Kraggash!' Marvin said. <br>'At your service.' And the man who had stolen Marvin's body bowed </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">mockingly, and grinned at Marvin with his own face. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">his cap and wig. Loosening his collar, he probed along his neck, unfastening <br>several invisible holders. Then, with a single movement, he peeled the tight-<br>fitting skin-mask from his face. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Detective Urdorf!' Marvin cried. <br>'Yes, it is I,' the Martian detective said. 'I am sorry we had to put you through </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">this, Marvin; but it was our best opportunity of bringing your case to a quick and <br>successful conclusion. My colleagues and I decided--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Colleagues?' Marvin asked. <br>'I forgot to make the introductions,' Detective Urdorf said, grinning wryly. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Marvin, I would like you to meet Lieutenant Ourie and Sergeant Fraff.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The two who had masqueraded as Lord Inglenook and Sir Gules now swept </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">off their skin-masks and revealed themselves in the uniforms of the North-west <br>Galactic Interstellar Constabulary. They grinned good-naturedly as they shook <br>Marvin's hand. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'And these gentlemen,' Urdorf said, gesturing at the Thuringian guards, 'have </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">also aided us considerably.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The guards removed their deal-coloured half-jackets of buff, and stood </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">revealed in the orange uniforms of Cassem City Traffic Patrolmen. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin turned to Cathy. She had already pinned to her bodice the red and </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">blue badge of a special agent in the Interplanetary Vigilance Association. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I - I think I understand,' Marvin said. <br>'It's really simple enough,' Detective Urdorf said. 'In working on your case, I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">had, as is usual, the aid and cooperation of various other law enforcement <br>agencies. Upon three separate occasions we came close to capturing our man; <br>but always he evaded us. This might have gone on indefinitely had we not tried <br>this scheme of entrapment. The theory was sound; for if Kraggash could succeed <br>in destroying you, he could claim your body as his own without fear of a <br>counter-claimant. Whereas, as long as you were alive, you would continue to <br>search for him. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Thus, we enticed you into our scheme, hoping that Kraggash would take </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">notice, and would enter the plan himself so as to be sure of destroying you. The <br>rest is history.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Turning to the unfrocked executioner, Detective Urdorf said, 'Kraggash, have </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">you anything to add?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The thief with Marvin's face lounged gracefully against the wall, his arms </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">folded and his body replete with composure. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I might hazard a comment or two,' Kraggash said. 'First, let me point out that </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">your scheme was clumsy and transparent. I believed it to be a hoax from the <br>start, and entered it only on the distant possibility of its being true. Therefore, I <br>am not surprised at this outcome.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'An amusing rationalization,' Urdorf said. <br>Kraggash shrugged. 'Secondly, I want to tell you that I feel no moral </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">compunction in the slightest at my so-called crime. If a man cannot retain </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft0"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">control of his own body, then he deserves to lose it. I have observed, during a <br>long and varied lifetime, that men will give their bodies to any rogue who asks, <br>and will enslave their minds to the first voice that commands them to obey. This <br>is why the vast majority of men cannot keep even their natural birthright of a <br>mind and body, but choose instead to rid themselves of those embarrassing <br>emblems of freedom.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That,' Detective Urdorf said, 'is the classic <i>apologia</i> of the criminal.' <br>'That which you call a crime when one man does it,' Kraggash said, 'you call </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">government when many men do it. Personally, I fail to see the distinction; and <br>failing to see it, I refuse to live by it.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'We could stand here all year splitting words,' Detective Urdorf said. 'But I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">do not have time for such recreation. Try your arguments on the prison chaplain, <br>Kraggash. I hereby arrest you for illegal Mindswapping, attempted murder, and <br>grand larceny. Thus I solve my 159th case and break my chain of bad luck.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Indeed?' Kraggash said coolly. 'Did you really think it would be so simple? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Or did you consider the possibility that the fox might have another lair?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Take him!' Urdorf shouted. The four policemen moved swiftly towards </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Kraggash. But even as they moved, the criminal raised his hand and drew a swift <br>circle in the air. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">The circle glowed with fire! <br>Kraggash put one leg over the circle. His leg disappeared. 'If you want me,' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">he said mockingly, 'you'll know where to find me.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">As the policemen rushed him, he stepped into the circle, and all of him </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">vanished except his head. He winked at Marvin. Then his head was gone, and <br>nothing was left except the circle of fire. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Come on!' Marvin shouted. 'Let's get him!' <br>He turned to Urdorf, and was amazed to see that the detective's shoulders had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">slumped, and that his face was grey with defeat. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Hurry!' Marvin cried. <br>'It is useless,' Urdorf said. 'I thought I was prepared for any ruse ... but not for </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">this. The man is obviously insane.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'What can we do?' Marvin shouted. <br>'We can do nothing,' Urdorf said. 'He has gone into the Twisted World, and I </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">have failed in my 159th case.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'But we can still follow him!' Marvin declared, moving up to the fiery circle. <br>'No! You must not!' Urdorf declared. 'You do not understand - the Twisted </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">World means death, or madness ... or both! Your chances of coming through it <br>are so small--' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I have just as good a chance as Kraggash!' Marvin shouted, and stepped into </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the circle. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Wait, you still do not understand!' Urdorf shouted. 'Kraggash <i>has no </i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft3"><i>chance</i>!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But Marvin did not hear those final words, for he had already vanished </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">The transition was abrupt, and not at all what Marvin thought it would be. He <br>had heard stories about the Twisted World, and had hazily expected to find a <br>place of melting shapes and shifting colours, of grotesques and marvels. But he <br>saw at once that his viewpoint had been romantic and limited. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He was in a small waiting-room. The air was stuffy with sweat and steam </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">heat, and he sat on a long wooden bench with several dozen other people. <br>Bored-looking clerks strolled up and down, consulting papers, and occasionally <br>calling for one of the waiting people. Then there would be a whispered <br>conference. Sometimes a man would lose patience and leave. Sometimes a new <br>applicant would arrive. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin waited, watched, daydreamed. Time passed slowly, the room grew </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">shadowy, someone switched on overhead lights. Still no one called his name. <br>Marvin glanced at the men on either side of him, bored rather than curious. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The man on his left was very tall and cadaverous, with an inflamed boil on </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">his neck where the collar rubbed. The man on his right was short and fat and <br>red-faced, and he wheezed with every breath. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'How much longer do you think it should take?' Marvin asked the fat man, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">more to pass the time than in a serious attempt to gain knowledge. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Long? How long?' the fat man said. '<i>Damned</i> long, that's how long it'll take. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">You can't hurry their goddamned majesties here in the Automobile Bureau, not <br>even when all you want is to have a perfectly ordinary driver's licence renewed, <br>which is what I'm here for.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The cadaverous man laughed: a sound like a stick of wood rapping against an </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">empty gasoline can. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'You'll wait a goddamned long time, baby,' he said, 'since you happen to be </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">sitting in the Department of Welfare, Small Accounts Division.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin spat thoughtfully on the dusty floor and said, 'It happens that both of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">you gentlemen are wrong. We are seated in the Department, in the <i>anteroom</i> of <br>the Department, to be precise, of the Department of Fisheries, I was trying to <br>say. And in my opinion it is a pretty state of affairs when a citizen and taxpayer <br>cannot even go fishing in a tax-supported body of water without wasting half a <br>day or more applying for a licence.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The three glared at each other. (There are no heroes in the Twisted World, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">damned few promises, a mere scattering of viewpoints, and not a conclusion in a <br>carload.) </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">They stared at each other with not particularly wild surmise. The cadaverous </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">man began to bleed slightly from the fingertips.

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">He glanced at his papers. 'You have made application for a corpse?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'That is correct,' Marvin said. <br>'And you affirm that said corpse will not be used for immoral purposes?' <br>'I so affirm.' <br>'Kindly state your reasons for acquiring this corpse.' <br>'I wish to use it in a purely decorative capacity.' <br>'Your qualifications?' <br>'I have studied interior decorating.' <br>'State the name and/or identification code number of the most recent corpse </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Cockroach.' Marvin replied. 'Brood number 3/32/A45345.' <br>'Killed by?' <br>'Myself. I am licensed to kill all creatures not of my subspecies, with certain </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'The purpose of your last killing?' <br>'Ritual purification.' <br>'Request granted,' the clerk said. 'Choose your corpse.' <br>The fat man and the cadaverous man looked at him with wet, hopeful eyes. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin was tempted, but managed to resist. He turned and said to the clerk, 'I <br>choose you.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'It shall be so noted,' the clerk said, scribbling on his papers. His face </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">changed to the face of the pseudo-Flynn. Marvin borrowed a crosscut saw from <br>the cadaverous man, and, with some difficulty, cut the clerk's right arm from his <br>body. The clerk expired unctuously, his face changing once again to his clerk's <br>face. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">The fat man laughed at Marvin's discomfiture. 'A little transubstantiality goes </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">a long way,' he sneered. 'But not far enough, eh? Desire shapes flesh, but death <br>is the final sculptor.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin was crying. The cadaverous man touched his arm in a kindly manner. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Don't take it so hard, kid. Symbolic revenge is better than no revenge at all. <br>Your plan was good; its flaw was external to yourself. I am James Grinnell <br>Starmacher.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I am a corpse,' said the corpse of the clerk 'Transposed revenge is better than </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">no revenge at all.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'I came here to renew my driving licence,' the fat man said. 'To hell with all </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Certainly sir,' said the corpse of the clerk. 'But in my present condition, I can </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Dead, alive, what difference does it make?' the fat man said. 'Fishing is the </span></nobr></DIV>

The walls were made of steel plates, and the ceiling was a hundred feet <br>above his head.

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Experiment 342,' Kraggash intoned crisply. 'Subject: Death. Proposition: </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Can a human being be killed? Remarks: This question concerning the possible <br>mortality of human beings has long perplexed our finest thinkers. A <br>considerable folklore has sprung up around the subject of death, and unverified <br>reports of <i>killings</i> have been made throughout the ages. Furthermore, corpses <br>have been brought forth from time to time, indubitably dead, and represented as <br>the remains of human beings. Despite the ubiquity of these corpses, no causal <br>link has ever been proven to show that they ever lived, much less that they were <br>once human beings. Therefore, in an attempt to settle the question once and for <br>all, we have set up the following experiment. Step one ...' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">a spear thrust forth at him. He sidestepped, made clumsy by his lame foot, and <br>evaded the thrust. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">More plates popped open. Knives, arrows, clubs, all were flung at him from </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">various angles. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">A poison-gas generator was pushed through an opening. <br>A tangle of cobras was dropped into the room. A lion and a tank bounded </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">forward. A blowgun hissed. Energy weapons crackled. Flamethrowers coughed. <br>A mortar cleared its throat. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Water flooded the room, rising quickly. Naphtha fire poured down from the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">ceiling. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But the fire burned the lions, which ate the snake, which clogged the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">howitzers, which crushed the spears, which jammed the gas generator, which <br>dissolved the water, which quenched the fire. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin stood forth miraculously unscathed. He shook his fist at Kraggash, </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">slipped on the steel plating, fell and broke his neck. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He was afforded a military funeral with full honours. His widow died with </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">him on the flaming pyre. Kraggash tried to follow, but was refused the solace of <br>suttee. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Marvin lay in the tomb for three days and three nights, during which time his </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">qualities worth mentioning. One of these objects was, presumably, Marvin. The <br>other four were lay figures, hastily sketched stereotypes designed for the sole <br>purpose of adorning the primary situation.

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">one to four, the fifth stubbornly insisting upon being called Kelly. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'All right, already,' said Number One, who had already taken an officious air. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Gentlemen, could we maybe stop beating our gums and bring this meeting to <br>order?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'A Jewish accent won't help you here,' Number Three said darkly. <br>'Look,' said Number One, 'what would a Polack know about Jewish accents? </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">I left Stanhope ...' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Shut up, Wop,' Number Four said. <br>'My name-a not Wop, my name-a she'sa Luigi,' Number Two responded </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Oh, I say!' Kelly said. 'That's really bad form, old man!' <br>'It'sa pretty goddamn disingenuous,' muttered Luigi. <br>'Invocation is <i>not</i> convocation,' said Number Three. <br>'But I really don't remember,' said Number Two. <br>'So I don't remember so good neither,' said Number One. 'But do you hear me </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">making a big thing out of it? I'm not even claiming to be human. The mere fact <br>that I can recite Leviticus by heart don't prove nothing.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">'Too right it doesn't!' shouted Luigi. 'And disproof don't prove any flaming </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I thought you were supposed to be Italian.' Kelly said to him. <br>'I am, but I was raised in Australia. It's rather a strange story--' <br>'No stranger than mine,' Kelly said. 'Black Irishman do you call me? But few </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">know that I passed my formative years in a Hangchow whorehouse, and that I <br>enlisted in the Canadian army to escape French persecution for my part in aiding <br>the Gaullists in Mauretania; and that is why--' </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Passive resistance is a form of aggression,' Number Four responded. <br>'Inadmissable evidence is still a form of evidence,' Three retorted. <br>'I don't know what any of you are talking about,' Number Two declared. <br>'Ignorance will get you nowhere,' Number Four snarled. 'I refuse </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'You can't give up what you haven't got,' Kelly said archly. <br>'I can give up anything I damned well want to!' Number Four cried </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">passionately. 'I not only give up my Marvinity; I also step down from the throne <br>of Spain, yield up to the dictatorship of the Inner Galaxy, and renounce my <br>salvation in Bahai.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Feel better now, kid?' Luigi asked sardonically. <br>'Yes ... It was insupportable. Simplification suits my intricate nature,' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Number Four said. 'Which of you is Kelly?' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'I am,' Kelly said. <br>'Do you realize,' Luigi asked him, 'that only you and I have names?' <br>'That's true,' Kelly said. 'You and I are different!' <br>'Here now, just a moment!' Number One said. <br>'Time, gentlemen, time, please!' <br>'Hold the fort!' <br>'Hold your water!' <br>'Hold the phone!' <br>'As I was saying,' Luigi said. 'We! Us! The Named Ones of the Proof </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">Presumptive! Kelly - you can be Marvin if I can be Kraggash!' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">'Done!' roared Kelly, over the protests of the lay figures. <br>Marvin and Kraggash grinned at each other in the momentary euphoria of </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">identity-intoxication. Then they flung themselves at each other's throats. Manual <br>strangulation followed apace. The three numbered ones, robbed of a birthright <br>they had never possessed, took up conventional poses of stylized ambiguity. The <br>two lettered ones, granted an identity they had seized anyhow, tore and bit at <br>each other, flung forth defiant arias and cringed before devastating recitatives. <br>Number One watched until he grew bored, then began playing with a lap <br>dissolve. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">away. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">But places like Stanhope do not fade, and boys like Marvin gradually lose </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">their sense of enchantment and high purpose. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Alone late at night in his attic room, Marvin often dreamed of Cathy. He still </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">found it difficult to think of her as a special agent of the Interplanetary Vigilance <br>Association. And yet, there had been a hint of officiousness in her manner, and a <br>glint of the righteous prosecutor in her beautiful eyes. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He loved her and would always mourn her loss; but he was more content to </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">mourn her than to possess her. And, if the truth must be told, Marvin's eye had <br>already been caught, or recaptured, by Marsha Baker, the demure and attractive <br>young daughter of Edwin Marsh Baker, Stanhope's leading real-estate dealer. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Stanhope, if not the best of all possible worlds, was still the best world </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Marvin had seen. It was a place where you could live without things jumping <br>out at you, and without your jumping out at things. No metaphoric deformation <br>was possible in Stanhope; a cow looked exactly like a cow, and to call it <br>anything else was unwarrantable poetic licence. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">And so, undoubtedly: east, west, home's the best: and Marvin set himself the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">task of enjoyment of the familiar, which sentimental wise men say is the apex of <br>human wisdom. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">His life was marred only by one or two small doubts. First and foremost was </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">the question: How had he come back to Earth from the Twisted World? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He did considerable research on this question, which was more ominous than </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">it first seemed. He realized that nothing is impossible in the Twisted World, and <br>that nothing is even improbable. There is causality in the Twisted World, but <br>there is also noncausality. Nothing <i>must</i> be; nothing is <i>necessary</i>. Because of <br>this, it was quite conceivable that the Twisted World had flung him back to <br>Earth, showing its power by relinquishing its power over Marvin. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">That indeed seemed to be what had happened. But there was another, less </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">pleasant alternative. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">This was expressed in the Doormhan Propositions as follows: 'Among the </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">kingdoms of probability that the Twisted World sets forth, one must be exactly <br>like our world, and another must be exactly like our world except for one detail, <br>and another exactly like our world except for two details. and so forth.' </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Which meant that he might still be on the Twisted World, and that this Earth </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">which he perceived might be no more than a passing emanation, a fleeting <br>moment of order in the fundamental chaos, destined to be dissolved at any <br>moment back into the fundamental senselessness of the Twisted World. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">In a way it made no difference, since nothing is permanent except our </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">illusions. But no one likes to have his illusions threatened, and Marvin wanted to <br>know where he stood. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft5">Was he on Earth, or was he on a replica of Earth? <br>Might there not be some significant detail inconsistent with the Earth he had </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">left? Might there not be several details? Marvin tried to find out for the sake of </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">his peace of mind. He explored Stanhope and its environs, looked and tested and <br>checked the flora and fauna. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Nothing seemed to be amiss. Life went on as usual; his father tended his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">herds of rats, and his mother placidly continued to lay eggs. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He went north to Boston and New York, then farther south to the vast </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">Philadelphia-Los Angeles area. Everything seemed in order. He contemplated <br>crossing the continent on the mighty Delaware River and continuing his search <br>in the California cities of Schenectady, Milwaukee, and Shanghai. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He changed his mind, however, realizing that there was no sense in spending </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft2">his life trying to discover whether or not he had a life to spend. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">Besides, there was the possibility that, even if the Earth were changed, his </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">memory and perceptions might also be changed, rendering discovery <br>impossible. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">He lay beneath Stanhope's familiar green sky and considered this possibility. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">It seemed unlikely: for did not the giant oak trees still migrate each year to the <br>south? Did not the huge red sun move across the sky, pursued by its dark <br>companion? Did not the triple moons return each month with their new <br>accumulation of comets? </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:98"><nobr><span class="ft2">These familiar sights reassured him. Everything seemed to be as it always </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:78"><nobr><span class="ft5">had been. And so, willingly and with a good grace, Marvin accepted his world at <br>face value, married Marsha Baker, and lived forever after. </span></nobr></DIV>
