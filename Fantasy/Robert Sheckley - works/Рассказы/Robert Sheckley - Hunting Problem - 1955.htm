  <P onmouseover=PNo(1045) style="TEXT-INDENT: 0px">In the 1950s, Robert 
  Sheckley's short stories appeared frequently in the top range of SF magazines. 
  They were always funny: sometimes cynically funny, sometimes bitterly funny, 
  sometimes horrifically funny&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but often enough warmly 
  funny. This is a warmly funny story.<BR><BR>One other thing, though: a 
  Sheckley story was never <I>merely</I> funny.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1046 name=p1046></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1046)>It was the last troop meeting before the big Scouter 
Jamboree, and all the patrols had turned out. Patrol 22—the Soaring Falcon 
Patrol—was camped in a shady hollow, holding a tentacle pull. The Brave Bison 
Patrol, number 31, was moving around a little stream. The Bisons were practicing 
their skill at drinking liquids, and laughing excitedly at the odd 
sensation.</P><A id=p1047 name=p1047></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1047)>And the Charging Mirash Patrol, number 19, was waiting 
for Scouter Drog, who was late as usual.</P><A id=p1048 name=p1048></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1048)>Drog hurtled down from the ten-thousand-foot level, 
went solid, and hastily crawled into the circle of scouters. "Gee," he said, 
"I'm sorry. I didn't realize what time—"</P><A id=p1049 name=p1049></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1049)>The Patrol Leader glared at him. "You're out of 
uniform, Drog."</P><A id=p1050 name=p1050></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1050)>"Sorry, sir," Drog said, hastily extruding a tentacle 
he had forgotten.</P><A id=p1051 name=p1051></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1051)>The others giggled. Drog blushed a dim orange. He 
wished he were invisible.</P><A id=p1052 name=p1052></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1052)>But it wouldn't be proper right now.</P><A id=p1053 
name=p1053></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1053)>"I will open our meeting with the Scouter Creed," the 
Patrol Leader said. He cleared his throat. "We, the Young Scouters of the planet 
Elbonai, pledge to perpetuate the skills and virtues of our pioneering 
ancestors. For that purpose, we Scouters adopt the shape our forebears were born 
to when they conquered the virgin wilderness of Elbonai. We hereby 
resolve—"</P><A id=p1054 name=p1054></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1054)>Scouter Drog adjusted his hearing receptors to amplify 
the Leader's soft voice. The Creed always thrilled him. It was hard to believe 
that his ancestors had once been earthbound. Today the Elbonai were aerial 
beings, maintaining only the minimum of body, fueling by cosmic radiation at the 
twenty-thousand-foot level, sensing by direct perception, coming down only for 
sentimental or sacramental purposes. They had come a long way since the Age of 
Pioneering. The modern world had begun with the Age of Submolecular Control, 
which was followed by the present age of Direct Control.</P><A id=p1055 
name=p1055></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1055)>"&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;honesty and fair play," the 
Leader was saying. "And we further resolve to drink liquids, as they did, and to 
eat solid food, and to increase our skill in their tools and methods."</P>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1056 name=p1056></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1056)>The invocation completed, the youngsters scattered 
around the plain. The Patrol Leader came up to Drog.</P><A id=p1057 
name=p1057></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1057)>"This is the last meeting before the Jamboree," the 
Leader said.</P><A id=p1058 name=p1058></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1058)>"I know," Drog said.</P><A id=p1059 name=p1059></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1059)>"And you are the only second-class scouter in the 
Charging Mirash Patrol. All the others are first-class, or at least Junior 
Pioneers. What will people think about our patrol?"</P><A id=p1060 
name=p1060></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1060)>Drog squirmed uncomfortably. "It isn't entirely my 
fault," he said. "I know I failed the tests in swimming and bomb making, but 
those just aren't my skills. It isn't fair to expect me to know everything. Even 
among the pioneers there were specialists. No one was expected to know 
all—"</P><A id=p1061 name=p1061></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1061)>"And just what are your skills?" the Leader 
interrupted.</P><A id=p1062 name=p1062></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1062)>"Forest and Mountain Lore," Drog answered eagerly. 
"Tracking and hunting."</P><A id=p1063 name=p1063></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1063)>The Leader studied him for a moment. Then he said 
slowly, "Drog, how would you like one last chance to make first class, and win 
an achievement badge as well?"</P><A id=p1064 name=p1064></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1064)>"I'd do anything!" Drog cried.</P><A id=p1065 
name=p1065></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1065)>"Very well," the Patrol Leader said. "What is the name 
of our patrol?"</P><A id=p1066 name=p1066></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1066)>"The Charging Mirash Patrol."</P><A id=p1067 
name=p1067></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1067)>"And what is a Mirash?"</P><A id=p1068 name=p1068></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1068)>"A large and ferocious animal," Drog answered promptly. 
"Once they inhabited large parts of Elbonai, and our ancestors fought many 
savage battles with them. Now they are extinct."</P><A id=p1069 name=p1069></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1069)>"Not quite," the Leader said. "A scouter was exploring 
the woods five hundred miles north of here, coordinates S-233 by 482-W, and he 
came upon a pride of three Mirash, all bulls, and therefore huntable. I want 
you, Drog, to track them down, to stalk them, using Forest and Mountain Lore. 
Then, utilizing only pioneering tools and methods, I want you to bring back the 
pelt of one Mirash. Do you think you can do it?"</P><A id=p1070 name=p1070></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1070)>"I know I can, sir!"</P><A id=p1071 name=p1071></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1071)>"Go at once," the Leader said. "We will fasten the pelt 
to our flagstaff. We will undoubtedly be commended at the Jamboree."</P><A 
id=p1072 name=p1072></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1072)>"Yes, <I>sir</I>!" Drog hastily gathered up his 
equipment, filled his canteen with liquid, packed a lunch of solid food, and set 
out.</P>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1073 name=p1073></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1073)>A few minutes later, he had levitated himself to the 
general area of S-233 by 482-W. It was a wild and romantic country of jagged 
rocks and scrubby trees, thick underbrush in the valleys, snow on the peaks. 
Drog looked around, somewhat troubled.</P><A id=p1074 name=p1074></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1074)>He had told the Patrol Leader a slight untruth.</P><A 
id=p1075 name=p1075></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1075)>The fact of the matter was, he wasn't particularly 
skilled in Forest and Mountain Lore, hunting or tracking. He wasn't particularly 
skilled in anything except dreaming away long hours among the clouds at the 
five-thousand-foot level. What if he failed to find a Mirash? What if the Mirash 
found him first?</P><A id=p1076 name=p1076></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1076)>But that couldn't happen, he assured himself. In a 
pinch, he could always gestibulize. Who would ever know?</P><A id=p1077 
name=p1077></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1077)>In another moment he picked up a faint trace of Mirash 
scent. And then he saw a slight movement about twenty yards away, near a curious 
T-shaped formation of rock.</P><A id=p1078 name=p1078></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1078)>Was it really going to be this easy? How nice! Quietly 
he adopted an appropriate camouflage and edged forward.</P>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1079 name=p1079></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1079)>The mountain trail became steeper, and the sun beat 
harshly down. Paxton was sweating, even in his air-conditioned coverall. And he 
was heartily sick of being a good sport.</P><A id=p1080 name=p1080></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1080)>"Just when are we leaving this place?" he asked.</P><A 
id=p1081 name=p1081></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1081)>Herrera slapped him genially on the shoulder. "Don't 
you wanna get rich?"</P><A id=p1082 name=p1082></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1082)>"We're rich already," Paxton said.</P><A id=p1083 
name=p1083></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1083)>"But not rich enough," Herrera told him, his long brown 
face creasing into a brilliant grin.</P><A id=p1084 name=p1084></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1084)>Stellman came up, puffing under the weight of his 
testing equipment. He set it carefully on the path and sat down. "You gentlemen 
interested in a short breather?" he asked.</P><A id=p1085 name=p1085></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1085)>"Why not?" Herrera said. "All the time in the world." 
He sat down with his back against a T-shaped formation of rock.</P><A id=p1086 
name=p1086></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1086)>Stellman lighted a pipe and Herrera found a cigar in 
the zippered pocket of his coverall. Paxton watched them for a while. Then he 
asked, "Well, when <I>are</I> we getting off this planet? Or do we set up 
permanent residence?"</P><A id=p1087 name=p1087></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1087)>Herrera just grinned and scratched a light for his 
cigar.</P><A id=p1088 name=p1088></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1088)>"Well, how about it?" Paxton shouted.</P><A id=p1089 
name=p1089></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1089)>"Relax, you're outvoted," Stellman said. "We formed 
this company as three equal partners."</P><A id=p1090 name=p1090></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1090)>"All using <I>my</I> money," Paxton said.</P><A 
id=p1091 name=p1091></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1091)>"Of course. That's why we took you in. Herrera had the 
practical mining experience. I had the theoretical knowledge and a pilot's 
license. You had the money."</P><A id=p1092 name=p1092></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1092)>"But we've got plenty of stuff on board now," Paxton 
said. "The storage compartments are completely filled. Why can't we go to some 
civilized place now and start spending?"</P><A id=p1093 name=p1093></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1093)>"Herrera and I don't have your aristocratic attitude 
toward wealth," Stellman said with exaggerated patience. "Herrera and I have the 
childish desire to fill every nook and cranny with treasure. Gold nuggets in the 
fuel tanks, emeralds in the flour cans, diamonds a foot deep on deck. And this 
is just the place for it. All manner of costly baubles are lying around just 
begging to be picked up. We want to be disgustingly, abysmally rich, 
Paxton."</P><A id=p1094 name=p1094></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1094)>Paxton hadn't been listening. He was staring intently 
at a point near the edge of the trail. In a low voice, he said, "That tree just 
moved."</P><A id=p1095 name=p1095></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1095)>Herrera burst into laughter. "Monsters, I suppose," he 
sneered.</P><A id=p1096 name=p1096></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1096)>"Be calm," Stellman said mournfully. "My boy, I am a 
middle-aged man, overweight and easily frightened. Do you think I'd stay here if 
there were the slightest danger?"</P><A id=p1097 name=p1097></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1097)>"There! It moved again!"</P><A id=p1098 name=p1098></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1098)>"We surveyed this planet three months ago," Stellman 
said. "We found no intelligent beings, no dangerous animals, no poisonous 
plants, remember? All we found were woods and mountains and gold and lakes and 
emeralds and rivers and diamonds. If there were something here, wouldn't it have 
attacked us long before?"</P><A id=p1099 name=p1099></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1099)>"I'm telling you I saw it move," Paxton insisted.</P><A 
id=p1100 name=p1100></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1100)>Herrera stood up. "This tree?" he asked Paxton.</P><A 
id=p1101 name=p1101></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1101)>"Yes. See, it doesn't even look like the others. 
Different -texture—"</P><A id=p1102 name=p1102></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1102)>In a single synchronized movement, Herrera pulled a 
Mark II blaster from a side holster and fired three charges into the tree. The 
tree and all underbrush for ten yards around burst into flame and 
crumpled.</P><A id=p1103 name=p1103></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1103)>"All gone now," Herrera said.</P><A id=p1104 
name=p1104></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1104)>Paxton rubbed his jaw. "I heard it scream when you shot 
it."</P><A id=p1105 name=p1105></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1105)>"Sure. But it's dead now," Herrera said soothingly. "If 
anything else moves, you just tell me, I shoot it. Now we find some more little 
emeralds, huh?"</P><A id=p1106 name=p1106></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1106)>Paxton and Stellman lifted their packs and followed 
Herrera up the trail. Stellman said in a low, amused voice, "Direct sort of 
fellow, isn't he?"</P>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1107 name=p1107></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1107)>Slowly Drog returned to consciousness. The Mirash's 
flaming weapon had caught him in camouflage, almost completely unshielded. He 
still couldn't understand how it had happened. There had been no premonitory 
fear-scent, no snorting, no snarling, no warning whatsoever. The Mirash had 
attacked with blind suddenness, without waiting to see whether he was friend or 
foe.</P><A id=p1108 name=p1108></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1108)>At last Drog understood the nature of the beast he was 
up against.</P><A id=p1109 name=p1109></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1109)>He waited until the hoofbeats of the three bull Mirash 
had faded into the distance. Then, painfully, he tried to extrude a visual 
receptor. Nothing happened. He had a moment of utter panic. If his central 
nervous system was damaged, this was the end.</P><A id=p1110 name=p1110></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1110)>He tried again. This time, a piece of rock slid off 
him, and he was able to reconstruct.</P><A id=p1111 name=p1111></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1111)>Quickly he performed an internal scansion. He sighed 
with relief. It had been a close thing. Instinctively he had quondicated at the 
flash moment and it had saved his life.</P><A id=p1112 name=p1112></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1112)>He tried to think of another course of action, but the 
shock of that sudden, vicious, unpremeditated assault had driven all Hunting 
Lore out of his mind. He found that he had absolutely no desire to encounter the 
savage Mirash again.</P><A id=p1113 name=p1113></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1113)>Suppose he returned without the stupid hide? He could 
tell the Patrol Leader that the Mirash were all females, and therefore 
unhuntable. A Young Scouter's word was honored, so no one would question him, or 
even check up.</P><A id=p1114 name=p1114></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1114)>But that would never do. How could he even consider 
it?</P><A id=p1115 name=p1115></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1115)>Well, he told himself gloomily, he could resign from 
the Scouters, put an end to the whole ridiculous business; the campfires, the 
singing, the games, the comradeship&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</P><A id=p1116 
name=p1116></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1116)>This would never do, Drog decided, taking himself 
firmly in hand. He was acting as though the Mirash were antagonists capable of 
planning against him. But the Mirash were not even intelligent beings. No 
creature without tentacles had ever developed true intelligence. That was 
Etlib's Law, and it had never been disputed.</P><A id=p1117 name=p1117></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1117)>In a battle between intelligence and instinctive 
cunning, intelligence always won. It had to. All he had to do was figure out 
how.</P><A id=p1118 name=p1118></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1118)>Drog began to track the Mirash again, following their 
odor. What colonial weapon should he use? A small atomic bomb? No, that would 
more than likely ruin the hide.</P><A id=p1119 name=p1119></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1119)>He stopped suddenly and laughed. It was really very 
simple, when one applied oneself. Why should he come into direct and dangerous 
contact with the Mirash? The time had come to use his brain, his understanding 
of animal psychology, his knowledge of Lures and Snares.</P><A id=p1120 
name=p1120></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1120)>Instead of tracking the Mirash, he would go to their 
den.</P><A id=p1121 name=p1121></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1121)>And there he would set a trap.</P>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1122 name=p1122></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1122)>Their temporary camp was in a cave, and by the time 
they arrived there it was sunset. Every crag and pinnacle of rock threw a 
precise and sharp-edged shadow. The ship lay five miles below them on the valley 
floor, its metallic hide glistening red and silver. In their packs were a dozen 
emeralds, small, but of an excellent color.</P><A id=p1123 name=p1123></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1123)>At an hour like this, Paxton thought of a small Ohio 
town, a soda fountain, a girl with bright hair. Herrera smiled to himself, 
contemplating certain gaudy ways of spending a million dollars before settling 
down to the serious business of ranching. And Stellman was already phrasing his 
Ph.D. thesis on extraterrestrial mineral deposits.</P><A id=p1124 
name=p1124></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1124)>They were all in a pleasant, relaxed mood. Paxton had 
recovered completely from his earlier attack of nerves. Now he wished an alien 
monster <I>would</I> show up—a green one, by preference—-chasing a lovely, 
scantily clad woman.</P><A id=p1125 name=p1125></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1125)>"Home again," Stellman said as they approached the 
entrance of the cave. "Want beef stew tonight?" It was his turn to cook.</P><A 
id=p1126 name=p1126></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1126)>"With onions," Paxton said, starting into the cave. He 
jumped back abruptly. "What's that?"</P><A id=p1127 name=p1127></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1127)>A few feet from the mouth of the cave was a small roast 
beef, still steaming hot, four large diamonds, and a bottle of whiskey.</P><A 
id=p1128 name=p1128></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1128)>"That's odd," Stellman said. "And a trifle 
unnerving."</P><A id=p1129 name=p1129></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1129)>Paxton bent down to examine a diamond. Herrera pulled 
him back.</P><A id=p1130 name=p1130></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1130)>"Might be booby-trapped."</P><A id=p1131 
name=p1131></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1131)>"There aren't any wires," Paxton said.</P><A id=p1132 
name=p1132></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1132)>Herrera stared at the roast beef, the diamonds, the 
bottle of whiskey. He looked very unhappy.</P><A id=p1133 name=p1133></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1133)>"I don't trust this," he said.</P><A id=p1134 
name=p1134></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1134)>"Maybe there <I>are</I> natives here," Stellman said. 
"Very timid ones. This might be their goodwill offering."</P><A id=p1135 
name=p1135></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1135)>"Sure," Herrera said. "They sent to Terra for a bottle 
of Old Space Ranger just for us."</P><A id=p1136 name=p1136></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1136)>"What are we going to do?" Paxton asked.</P><A id=p1137 
name=p1137></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1137)>"Stand clear," Herrera said. "Move 'way back." He broke 
off a long branch from a nearby tree and poked gingerly at the diamonds.</P><A 
id=p1138 name=p1138></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1138)>"Nothing's happening," Paxton said.</P><A id=p1139 
name=p1139></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1139)>The long grass Herrera was standing on whipped tightly 
around his ankles. The ground beneath him surged, broke into a neat disk fifteen 
feet in diameter and, trailing root-ends, began to lift itself into the air. 
Herrera tried to jump free, but the grass held him like a thousand green 
tentacles.</P><A id=p1140 name=p1140></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1140)>"Hang on!" Paxton yelled idiotically, rushed forward 
and grabbed a corner of the rising disk of earth. It dipped steeply, stopped for 
a moment, and began to rise again. By then Herrera had his knife out, and was 
slashing the grass around his ankles. Stellman came unfrozen when he saw Paxton 
rising past his head.</P><A id=p1141 name=p1141></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1141)>Stellman seized him by the ankles, arresting the flight 
of the disk once more. Herrera wrenched one foot free and threw himself over the 
edge. The other ankle was held for a moment, then the tough grass parted under 
his weight. He dropped headfirst to the ground, at the last moment ducking his 
head and landing on his shoulders. Paxton let go of the disk and fell, landing 
on Stellman's stomach.</P><A id=p1142 name=p1142></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1142)>The disk of earth, with its cargo of roast beef,

<P onmouseover=PNo(1143)>The sun had set. Without speaking, the three men 
entered their cave, blasters drawn. They built a roaring fire at the mouth and 
moved back into the cave's interior.</P><A id=p1144 name=p1144></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1144)>"We'll guard in shifts tonight," Herrera said.</P><A

<P onmouseover=PNo(1145)>Paxton and Stellman nodded.</P><A id=p1146

<P onmouseover=PNo(1146)>Herrera said, "I think you're right, Paxton. We've 
stayed here long enough."</P><A id=p1147 name=p1147></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1147)>"Too long," Paxton said.</P><A id=p1148 name=p1148></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1148)>Herrera shrugged his shoulders. "As soon as it's light, 
we return to the ship and get out of here."</P><A id=p1149 name=p1149></A>

<P onmouseover=PNo(1150)>Drog was quite discouraged. With a sinking heart he had 
watched the premature springing of his trap, the struggle, and the escape of the 
Mirash. It had been such a splendid Mirash, too. The biggest of the three!</P><A 
id=p1151 name=p1151></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1151)>He knew now what he had done wrong. In his eagerness, 
he had overbaited his trap. Just the minerals would have been sufficient, for 
Mirash were notoriously mineral-tropic. But no, he had to improve on pioneer 
methods, he had to use food stimuli as well. No wonder they had reacted 
suspiciously, with their senses so overburdened.</P><A id=p1152 name=p1152></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1152)>Now they were enraged, alert, and decidedly 
dangerous.</P><A id=p1153 name=p1153></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1153)>And a thoroughly aroused Mirash was one of the most 
fearsome sights in the Galaxy.</P><A id=p1154 name=p1154></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1154)>Drog felt very much alone as Elbonai's twin moons rose 
in the western sky. He could see the Mirash campfire blazing in the mouth of 
their cave. And by direct perception he could see the Mirash crouched within, 
every sense alert, weapons ready.</P><A id=p1155 name=p1155></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1155)>Was a Mirash hide really worth all this trouble?</P><A 
id=p1156 name=p1156></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1156)>Drog decided that he would much rather be floating at 
the five-thousand-foot level, sculpturing cloud formations and dreaming. He 
wanted to sop up radiation instead of eating nasty old solid food. And what use 
was all this hunting and trapping, anyhow? Worthless skills that his people had 
outgrown.</P><A id=p1157 name=p1157></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1157)>For a moment he almost had himself convinced. And then, 
in a flash of pure perception, he understood what it was all about.</P><A 
id=p1158 name=p1158></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1158)>True, the Elbonaians had outgrown their competition, 
developed past all danger of competition. But the Universe was wide, and capable 
of many surprises. Who could foresee what would come, what new dangers the race 
might have to face? And how could they meet them if the hunting instinct was 
lost?</P><A id=p1159 name=p1159></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1159)>No, the old ways had to be preserved, to serve as 
patterns; as reminders that peaceable, intelligent life was an unstable entity 
in an unfriendly Universe.</P><A id=p1160 name=p1160></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1160)>He was going to get that Mirash hide, or die 
trying!</P><A id=p1161 name=p1161></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1161)>The most important thing was to get them out of that 
cave. Now his hunting knowledge had returned to him.</P><A id=p1162

<P onmouseover=PNo(1162)>Quickly, skillfully, he shaped a Mirash horn.</P>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1163 name=p1163></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1163)>"Did you hear that?" Paxton asked.</P><A id=p1164

<P onmouseover=PNo(1164)>"I thought I heard something," Stellman said, and they 
all listened intently.</P><A id=p1165 name=p1165></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1165)>The sound came again. It was a voice crying, "Oh, help, 
help me!"</P><A id=p1166 name=p1166></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1166)>"It's a girl!" Paxton jumped to his feet.</P><A

hold out much longer. Is there anyone who can help me?"</P><A id=p1169 
name=p1169></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1169)>Blood rushed to Paxton's face. In a flash he saw her, 
small, exquisite, standing beside her wrecked sports-spacer (what a foolhardy 
trip it had been!) with monsters, green and slimy, closing in on her. And then 
<I>he</I> arrived, a foul alien beast.</P><A id=p1170 name=p1170></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1170)>Paxton picked up a spare blaster. "I'm going out 
there," he said coolly.</P><A id=p1171 name=p1171></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1171)>"Sit down, you moron!" Herrera ordered.</P><A id=p1172

<P onmouseover=PNo(1173)>"That can't be a girl," Herrera said. "What would a 
girl be doing on this planet?"</P><A id=p1174 name=p1174></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1174)>"I'm going to find out," Paxton said, brandishing two 
blasters. "Maybe a spaceliner crashed, or she could have been out joyriding, 
and—"</P><A id=p1175 name=p1175></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1175)>"Siddown!" Herrera yelled.</P><A id=p1176

<P onmouseover=PNo(1176)>"He's right," Stellman tried to reason with Paxton. 
"Even if a girl <I>is</I> out there, which I doubt, there's nothing we can 
do."</P><A id=p1177 name=p1177></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1177)>"Oh, help, help, it's coming after me!" the girl's 
voice screamed.</P><A id=p1178 name=p1178></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1178)>"Get out of my way," Paxton said, his voice low and 
-dangerous.</P><A id=p1179 name=p1179></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1179)>"You're really going?" Herrera asked 
incredulously.</P><A id=p1180 name=p1180></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1180)>"Yes! Are you going to stop me?"</P><A id=p1181 
name=p1181></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1181)>"Go ahead." Herrera gestured at the entrance of the 
cave.</P><A id=p1182 name=p1182></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1182)>"We can't let him!" Stellman gasped.</P><A id=p1183 
name=p1183></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1183)>"Why not? His funeral," Herrera said lazily.</P><A 
id=p1184 name=p1184></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1184)>"Don't worry about me," Paxton said. "I'll be back in 
fifteen minutes—with her!" He turned on his heel and started toward the 
entrance. Herrera leaned forward and, with considerable precision, clubbed 
Paxton behind the ear with a stick of firewood. Stellman caught him as he 
fell.</P><A id=p1185 name=p1185></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1185)>They stretched Paxton out in the rear of the cave and 
returned to their vigil. The lady in distress moaned and pleaded for the next 
five hours. Much too long, as Paxton had to agree, even for a movie serial.</P>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1186 name=p1186></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1186)>A gloomy, rain-splattered daybreak found Drog still 
camped a hundred yards from the cave. He saw the Mirash emerge in a tight group, 
weapons ready, eyes watching warily for any movement.</P><A id=p1187 
name=p1187></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1187)>Why had the Mirash horn failed? The Scouter Manual said 
it was an infallible means of attracting the bull Mirash. But perhaps this 
wasn't mating season.</P><A id=p1188 name=p1188></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1188)>They were moving in the direction of a metallic ovoid 
which Drog recognized as a primitive spatial conveyance. It was crude, but once 
inside it the Mirash were safe from him.</P><A id=p1189 name=p1189></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1189)>He could simply trevest them, and that would end it. 
But it wouldn't be very humane. Above all, the ancient Elbonaians had been 
gentle and merciful, and a Young Scouter tried to be like them. Besides, 
trevestment wasn't a true pioneering method.</P><A id=p1190 name=p1190></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1190)>That left ilitrocy. It was the oldest trick in the

it.</P>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1192 name=p1192></A>

<P onmouseover=PNo(1193)>Herrera cursed angrily as it grew more dense. "Keep 
close together now. Of all the luck!"</P><A id=p1194 name=p1194></A>

<P onmouseover=PNo(1217)>"Why?"</P><A id=p1218 name=p1218></A>

<P onmouseover=PNo(1219)>Herrera yelled, "Get down, get down quick, give me room 
to shoot!" But it was too late. A sweet-sour odor was in the air. Stellman and 
Paxton smelled it and collapsed. Herrera ran forward blindly, trying to hold his 
breath. He stumbled and fell over a rock, tried to get back on his feet—</P><A

<P onmouseover=PNo(1220)>And everything went black.</P><A id=p1221

<P onmouseover=PNo(1221)>The fog lifted suddenly and Drog was standing alone,

the nearest Mirash.</P>
<DIV align=center>* * *</DIV><A id=p1222 name=p1222></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1222)>The spaceship hurtled toward Terra at a velocity which 
threatened momentarily to burn out the overdrive. Herrera, hunched over the 
controls, finally regained his self-control and cut the speed down to normal. 
His usual tan face was still ashen, and his hands shook on the 
instruments.</P><A id=p1223 name=p1223></A>

diamonds is the best of therapies, I understand."</P><A id=p1228 name=p1228></A>
<P onmouseover=PNo(1228)>Herrera grinned, and his face began to regain its 
normal color. "I feel like doing a little diamond-cutting myself, now that it's 
all turned out okay." Then his long face became serious. "But I ask you, 
Stellman, who could figure it? I still don't understand!"</P>
