<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft0"><b>Cordle To Onion To Carrot</b></span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">by Robert Sheckley</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Surely, you remember that bully who kicked sand on the 97-pound-weakling? Well,<br>that puny man's problem has never been solved, despite Charles Atlas's claims to<br>the contrary. A genuine bully <i>likes</i> to kick sand on people; for him, simply, there is<br>gut-deep satisfaction in a put-down. It wouldn't matter if you weighed 240<br>pounds—all of it rock-hard muscle and steely sinew—and were as wise as Solomon<br>or as witty as Voltaire; you'd still end up with the sand of an insult in your eyes, and<br>probably you wouldn't do anything about it. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">That was how Howard Cordle viewed the situation. He was a pleasant man who was<br>forever being pushed around by Fuller Brush men, fund solicitors, headwaiters, and<br>other imposing figures of authority. Cordle hated it. He suffered in silence the<br>countless numbers of manic-aggressives who shoved their way to the heads of<br>lines, took taxis he had hailed first and sneeringly steered away girls to whom he<br>was talking at parties. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">What made it worse was that these people seemed to welcome provocation, to go<br>looking for it, all for the sake of causing discomfort to others. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Cordle couldn't understand why this should be, until one midsummer's day, when he<br>was driving through the northern regions of Spain while stoned out of his mind, the<br>god Thoth-Hermes granted him original enlightenment by murmuring, &quot;Uh, look, I<br>groove with the problem, baby, but dig, we gotta put carrots in or it ain't no stew.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2"><i>&quot;Carrots?&quot;</i> said Cordle, struggling for illumination. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;I'm talking about those types who get you uptight,&quot; Thoth-Hermes explained.<br>&quot;They <i>gotta</i> act that way, baby, on account of they're carrots, and that's how<br>carrots are.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;If they are carrots,&quot; Cordle said, feeling his way, &quot;then I—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;You, of course, are a little pearly-white onion.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Yes! My God, yes!&quot; Cordle cried, dazzled by the blinding light of satori. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;And, naturally, you and all the other pearly-white onions think that carrots are just<br>bad news, merely some kind of misshapen orangey onion; whereas the carrots look<br>at you and rap about <i>freaky round white carrots, wow!</i> I mean, you're just too much<br>for each other, whereas, in actuality—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Yes, go on!&quot; cried Cordle. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;In actuality,&quot; Thoth-Hermes declared, <i>&quot;everything's got a place in The Stew!&quot;</i> </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Of course! I see, I see, I see!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;And <i>that</i> means that everybody who exists is necessary, and you <i>must</i> have long<br>hateful orange carrots if you're also going to have nice pleasant decent white<br>onions, or vice versa, because without all the ingredients, it isn't a Stew, which is to<br>say, life, it becomes, uh, let me see.…&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;A soup!&quot; cried ecstatic Cordle. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;You're coming in five by five,&quot; chanted Thoth-Hermes. &quot;Lay down the word,<br>deacon, and let the people know the divine formula.…&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;A <i>soup!&quot;</i> said Cordle. &quot;Yes, I see it now—creamy, pure-white onion soup is our<br>dream of heaven, whereas fiery orange carrot broth is our notion of hell. It fits, it all<br>fits together!&quot; </span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Om manipadme hum,&quot; intoned Thoth-Hermes. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;But where do the green peas go? What about the <i>meat,</i> for God's sake?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Don't pick at the metaphor,&quot; Thoth-Hermes advised him, &quot;it leaves a nasty scab.<br>Stick with the carrots and onions. And, here, let me offer you a drink—a house<br>specialty.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;But the spices, where do you put the <i>spices?&quot;</i> Cordle demanded, taking a long swig<br>of burgundy-colored liquid from a rusted canteen. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Baby, you're asking questions that can be revealed only to a thirteenth-degree<br>Mason with piles, wearing sandals. Sorry about that. Just remember that everything<br>goes into The Stew.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Into The Stew,&quot; Cordle repeated, smacking his lips. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;And, especially, stick with the carrots and onions; you were really grooving there.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Carrots and onions,&quot; Cordle repeated. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;That's your trip,&quot; Thoth-Hermes said. &quot;Hey, we've gotten to Corunna; you can let<br>me out anywhere around here.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Cordle pulled his rented car off the road. Thoth-Hermes took his knapsack from the<br>back seat and got out. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Thanks for the lift, baby.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;My pleasure. Thank <i>you</i> for the wine. What kind did you say it was?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3"><i>&quot;Vino de casa</i> mixed with a mere smidgen of old Dr. Hammerfinger's essence of<br>instant powdered Power-Pack brand acid. Brewed by gnurrs in the secret<br>laboratories of UCLA in preparation for the big all-Europe turn-on.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Whatever it was, it surely <i>was,&quot;</i> Cordle said deeply. &quot;Pure elixir to me. You could sell<br>neckties to antelopes with that stuff; you could change the world from an oblate<br>spheroid into a truncated trapezoid.… What did I say?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Never mind, it's all part of your trip. Maybe you better lie down for a while, huh?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Where gods command, mere mortals must obey,&quot; Cordle said iambically. He lay<br>down on the front seat of the car. Thoth-Hermes bent over him, his beard burnished<br>gold, his head wreathed in plane trees. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;You okay?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Never better in my life.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Want me to stand by?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Unnecessary. You have helped me beyond potentiality.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Glad to hear it, baby, you're making a fine sound. You really are okay? Well, then,<br>ta.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Thoth-Hermes marched off into the sunset. Cordle closed his eyes and solved<br>various problems that had perplexed the greatest philosophers of all ages. He was<br>mildly surprised at how simple complexity was. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">At last he went to sleep. He awoke some six hours later. He had forgotten most of<br>his brilliant insights, the lucid solutions. It was inconceivable: How can one misplace<br>the keys of the universe? But he had, and there seemed no hope of reclaiming<br>them. Paradise was lost for good. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">He did remember about the onions and carrots, though, and he remembered The</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Stew. It was not the sort of insight he might have chosen if he'd had any choice; but<br>this was what had come to him, and he did not reject it. Cordle knew, perhaps<br>instinctively, that in the insight game, you take whatever you can get. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:304"><span class="ft1">· · · · ·  </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The next day, he reached Santander in a driving rain. He decided to write amusing<br>letters to all his friends, perhaps even try his hand at a travel sketch. That required a<br>typewriter. The <i>conserje</i> at his hotel directed him to a store that rented typewriters.<br>He went there and found a clerk who spoke perfect English. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Do you rent typewriters by the day?&quot; Cordle asked. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Why not?&quot; the clerk replied. He had oily black hair and a thin aristocratic nose. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;How much for that one?&quot; Cordle asked, indicating a thirty-year-old Erika portable. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Seventy pesetas a day, which is to say, one dollar. Usually.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Isn't this usually?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Certainly not, since you are a foreigner in transit. For you, once hundred and eighty<br>pesetas a day.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;All right,&quot; Cordle said, reaching for his wallet. &quot;I'd like to have it for two days.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;I shall also require your passport and a deposit of fifty dollars.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Cordle attempted a mild joke. &quot;Hey, I just want to type on it, not marry it.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">The clerk shrugged. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Look, the <i>conserje</i> has my passport at the hotel. How about taking my driver's<br>license instead?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Certainly not. I must hold your passport, in case you decide to default.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;But why do you need my passport <i>and</i> the deposit?&quot; Cordle asked, feeling bullied<br>and ill at ease. &quot;I mean, look, the machine's not worth twenty dollars.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;You are an expert, perhaps, in the Spanish market value of used German<br>typewriters?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;No, but—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Then permit me, sir, to conduct my business as I see fit. I will also need to know<br>the use to which you plan to put the machine.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;The <i>use?&quot;</i> </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Of course, the use.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">It was one of these preposterous foreign situations that can happen to anyone. The<br>clerk's request was incomprehensible and his manner was insulting. Cordle was<br>about to give a curt little nod, turn on his heel and walk out. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Then he remembered about the onions and carrots. He saw The Stew. And<br>suddenly, it occurred to Cordle that he could be whatever vegetable he wanted to<br>be. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">He turned to the clerk. He smiled winningly. He said, &quot;You wish to know the use I will<br>make of the typewriter?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Exactly.&quot; </span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Well,&quot; Cordle said, &quot;quite frankly, I had planned to stuff it up my nose.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">The clerk gaped at him. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;It's quite a successful method of smuggling,&quot; Cordle went on. &quot;I was also planning<br>to give you a stolen passport and counterfeit pesetas. Once I got into Italy, I would<br>have sold the typewriter for ten thousand dollars. Milan is undergoing a typewriter<br>famine, you know; they're desperate, they'll buy anything.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Sir,&quot; the clerk said, &quot;you choose to be disagreeable.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Nasty is the word you were looking for. I've changed my mind about the<br>typewriter. But let me compliment you on your command of English.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;I have studied assiduously,&quot; the clerk admitted, with a hint of pride. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;That is evident. And, despite a certain weakness in the Rs, you succeed in sounding<br>like a Venetian gondolier with a cleft palate. My best wishes to your esteemed<br>family. I leave you now to pick your pimples in peace.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:304"><span class="ft1">· · · · ·  </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Reviewing the scene later, Cordle decided that he had performed quite well in his<br>maiden appearance as a carrot. True, his closing lines had been a little forced and<br>overintellectualized. But the undertone of viciousness had been convincing. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Most important was the simple resounding fact that he had done it. And now, in the<br>quiet of his hotel room, instead of churning his guts in a frenzy of self-loathing, he<br>had the tranquilizing knowledge of having put someone else in that position. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">He had done it! Just like that, he had transformed himself from onion into carrot! </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">But was his position ethically defensible? Presumably, the clerk could not help being<br>detestable; he was a product of his own genetic and social environment, a victim of<br>his conditioning; he was naturally rather than intentionally hateful— </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Cordle stopped himself. He saw that he was engaged in typical onionish thinking,<br>which was an inability to conceive of carrots except as an aberration from<br>oniondom. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">But now he knew that both onions <i>and</i> carrots had to exist; otherwise, there would<br>be no Stew. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">And he also knew that a man was free and could choose whatever vegetable he<br>wanted to be. He could even live as an amusing little green pea, or a gruff, forceful<br>clove of garlic (though perhaps that was scratching at the metaphor). In any event,<br>a man could take his pick between carrothood and oniondom. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">There is much to think about here, Cordle thought. But he never got around to<br>thinking about it. Instead, he went sightseeing, despite the rain, and then continued<br>his travels. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:304"><span class="ft1">· · · · ·  </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The next incident occurred in Nice, in a cozy little restaurant on the Avenue des<br>Diables Bleus, with red-checkered tablecloths and incomprehensible menus written in<br>longhand and purple ink. There were four waiters, one of whom looked like</span></DIV>

<!-- Page 5 -->
<a name="5"></a>

<STYLE type="text/css">
<!--
-->
</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Jean-Paul Belmondo, down to the cigarette drooping from his long lower lip. The<br>others looked like run-of-the-mill muggers. There were several Scandinavian<br>customers quietly eating a <i>cassoulet,</i> one old Frenchman in a beret and three<br>homely English girls. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Belmondo sauntered over. Cordle, who spoke a clear though idiomatic French,<br>asked for the ten-franc menu he had seen hanging in the window. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The waiter gave him the sort of look one reserves for pretentious beggars. &quot;Ah, that<br>is all finished for today,&quot; he said, and handed Cordle a 30-franc menu. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">In his previous incarnation, Cordle would have bit down on the bullet and ordered. Or<br>possibly he would have risen, trembling with outrage, and left the restaurant,<br>blundering into a chair on the way. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">But now— </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Perhaps you did not understand me,&quot; Cordle said. &quot;It is a matter of French law that<br>you must serve from all of the fixed-price menus that you show in the window.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2"><i>&quot;M'sieu</i> is a lawyer?&quot; the waiter inquired, his hands perched insolently on his hips. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;No. <i>M'sieu</i> is a troublemaker,&quot; Cordle said, giving what he considered to be fair<br>warning. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Then <i>m'sieu</i> must make what trouble he desires,&quot; the waiter said. His eyes were<br>slits. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Okay,&quot; Cordle said. And just then, fortuitously, an elderly couple came into the<br>restaurant. The man wore a double-breasted slate-blue suit with a half-inch white pin<br>stripe. The woman wore a flowered organdy dress. Cordle called to them, &quot;Excuse<br>me, are you folks English?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">A bit startled, the man inclined his head in the barest intimation of a nod. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Then I would advise you not to eat here. I am a health inspector for UNESCO. The<br>chef has apparently not washed his hands since D Day. We haven't made a definitive<br>test for typhoid yet, but we have our suspicions. As soon as my assistant arrives<br>with the litmus paper.…&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">A deathly hush had fallen over the restaurant. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;I suppose a boiled egg would be safe enough,&quot; Cordle said. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The elderly man probably didn't believe him. But it didn't matter, Cordle was<br>obviously trouble. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Come, Mildred,&quot; he said, and they hurried out. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;There goes sixty francs plus five percent tip,&quot; Cordle said, coolly. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Leave here at once!&quot; the waiter snarled. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;I like it here,&quot; Cordle said, folding his arms. &quot;I like the <i>ambiance,</i> the sense of<br>intimacy—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;You are not permitted to stay without eating.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;I shall eat. From the ten-franc menu.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The waiters looked at one another, nodded in unison and began to advance in a<br>threatening phalanx. Cordle called to the other diners, &quot;I ask you all to bear witness!<br>These men are going to attack me, four against one, contrary to French law and<br>universal human ethics, simply because I want to order from the ten-franc menu,<br>which they have falsely advertised.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">It was a long speech, but this was clearly the time for grandiloquence. Cordle</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">repeated it in English. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The English girls gasped. The old Frenchman went on eating his soup. The<br>Scandinavians nodded grimly and began to take off their jackets. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The waiters held another conference. The one who looked like Belmondo said, <br><i>&quot;M'sieu,</i> you are forcing us to call the police.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;That will save me the trouble,&quot; Cordle said, &quot;of calling them myself.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Surely, <i>m'sieu</i> does not want to spend his holiday in court?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;That is how <i>m'sieu</i> spends most of his holidays,&quot; Cordle said. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The waiters conferred again. Then Belmondo stalked over with the 30-franc menu.<br>&quot;The cost of the <i>prix fixe</i> will be ten francs, since evidently that is all <i>m'sieu</i> can<br>afford.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Cordle let that pass. &quot;Bring me onion soup, green salad and the <i>boeuf bourguignon.&quot;</i> </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The waiter went to put in the order. While he was waiting, Cordle sang &quot;Waltzing<br>Matilda&quot; in a moderately loud voice. He suspected it might speed up the service. He<br>got his food by the time he reached &quot;You'll never catch me alive, said he&quot; for the<br>second time. Cordle pulled the tureen of stew toward him and lifted a spoon. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">It was a breathless moment. Not one diner had left the restaurant. And Cordle was<br>prepared. He leaned forward, soupspoon in shoveling position, and sniffed delicately.<br>A hush fell over the room. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;It lacks a certain something,&quot; Cordle said aloud. Frowning, he poured the onion<br>soup into the <i>boeuf bourguignon.</i> He sniffed, shook his head and added a half loaf of<br>bread, in slices. He sniffed again and added the salad and the contents of a<br>saltcellar. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Cordle pursed his lips. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;it simply will not do.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">He overturned the entire contents of the tureen onto the table. It was an act<br>comparable, perhaps, to throwing gentian violet on the <i>Mona Lisa.</i> All of France and<br>most of western Switzerland went into a state of shock. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Unhurriedly, but keeping the frozen waiters under surveillance, Cordle rose and<br>dropped ten francs into the mess. He walked to the door, turned and said, &quot;My<br>compliments to the chef, who might better be employed as a cement mixer. And<br>this, <i>mon vieux,</i> is for you.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">He threw his crumpled linen napkin onto the floor. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">As the matador, after a fine series of passes, turns his back contemptuously on the<br>bull and strolls away, so went Cordle. For some unknown reason, the waiters did<br>not rush out after him, shoot him dead and hang his corpse from the nearest<br>lamppost. So Cordle walked for ten or fifteen blocks, taking rights and lefts at<br>random. He came to the Promenade des Anglais and sat down on a bench. He was<br>trembling and his shirt was drenched with perspiration. </span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Now he really knew why carrots acted that way. Dear God in heaven, what joy,<br>what delectable bliss! </span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">stayed that way until his second day in Rome. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">He was in his rented car. He and seven other drivers were lined up at a traffic light<br>on the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II. There were perhaps twenty cars behind them. All<br>of the drivers were revving their engines, hunched over their steering wheels with<br>slitted eyes, dreaming of Le Mans. All except Cordle, who was drinking in the<br>cyclopean architecture of downtown Rome. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The checkered flag came down! The drivers floored their accelerators, trying to spin<br>the wheels of their underpowered Fiats, wearing out their clutches and their nerves,<br>but doing so with éclat and <i>brio.</i> All except Cordle, who seemed to be the only man<br>in Rome who didn't have to win a race or keep an appointment. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Without undue haste or particular delay, Cordle depressed the clutch and engaged<br>the gear. Already he had lost nearly two seconds—unthinkable at Monza or Monte<br>Carlo. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">The driver behind him blew his horn frantically. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Cordle smiled to himself, a secret, ugly expression. He put the gearshift into neutral,<br>engaged the hand brake and stepped out of his car. He ambled over to the<br>hornblower, who had turned pasty white and was fumbling under his seat, hoping to<br>find a tire iron. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Yes?&quot; said Cordle, in French, &quot;is something wrong?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;No, no, nothing,&quot; the driver replied in French—his first mistake. &quot;I merely wanted<br>you to go, to move.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;But I was just doing that,&quot; Cordle pointed out. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Well, then! It is all right!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;No, it is not all right,&quot; Cordle told him. &quot;I think I deserve a better explanation of why<br>you blew your horn at me.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The hornblower—a Milanese businessman on holiday with his wife and four<br>children—rashly replied, &quot;My dear sir, you were slow, you were delaying us all.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3"><i>&quot;Slow?&quot;</i> said Cordle. &quot;You blew your horn two seconds after the light changed. Do<br>you call two seconds slow?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;It was much longer than that,&quot; the man riposted feebly. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Traffic was now backed up as far south as Naples. A crowd of ten thousand had<br>gathered. <i>Carabinieri</i> units in Viterbo and Genoa had been called into a state of<br>alert. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;That is untrue,&quot; Cordle said. &quot;I have witnesses.&quot; He gestured at the crowd, which<br>gestured back. &quot;I shall call my witnesses before the courts. You must know that you<br>broke the law by blowing your horn within the city limits of Rome in what was clearly<br>not an emergency.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The Milanese businessman looked at the crowd, now swollen to perhaps fifty<br>thousand. Dear God, he thought, if only the Goths would descend again and<br>exterminate these leering Romans! If only the ground would open up and swallow<br>this insane Frenchman! If only he, Giancarlo Morelli, had a dull spoon with which to<br>open up the veins of his wrist! </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Jets from the Sixth Fleet thundered overhead, hoping to avert the long-expected <br><i>coup d'état.</i> </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The Milanese businessman's own wife was shouting abuse at him: Tonight he would<br>cut out her faithless heart and mail it back to her mother. </span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">What was there to do? In Milan, he would have had this Frenchman's head on a<br>platter. But this was Rome, a southern city, an unpredictable and dangerous place.<br>And legalistically, he was possibly in the wrong, which left him at a further<br>disadvantage in the argument. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Very well,&quot; he said. &quot;The blowing of the horn was perhaps truly unnecessary,<br>despite the provocation.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;I insist on a genuine apology,&quot; insisted Cordle. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">There was a thundering sound to the east: Thousands of Soviet tanks were moving<br>into battle formation across the plains of Hungary, ready to resist the long-expected<br>NATO thrust into Transylvania. The water supply was cut off in Foggia, Brindisi, Bari.<br>The Swiss closed their frontiers and stood ready to dynamite the passes. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;All right, I apologize!&quot; the Milanese businessman screamed. &quot;I am sorry I provoked<br>you and ever sorrier that I was born! Again, I apologize! Now will you go away and<br>let me have a heart attack in peace?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;I accept your apology,&quot; Cordle said. &quot;No hard feelings, eh?&quot; He strolled back to his<br>car, humming &quot;Blow the Man Down,&quot; and drove away as millions cheered. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">War was once again averted by a hairbreadth. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Cordle drove to the Arch of Titus, parked his car and—to the sound of a thousand<br>trumpets—passed through it. He deserved this triumph as well as any Caesar. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">God, he gloated, I was <i>loathsome!</i> </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:304"><span class="ft1">· · · · ·  </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">In England, Cordle stepped on a young lady's toe just inside the Traitor's Gate of the<br>Tower of London. This should have served as an intimation of something. The young<br>lady was named Mavis. She came from Short Hills, New Jersey, and she had long<br>straight dark hair. She was slender, pretty, intelligent, energetic and she had a sense<br>of humor. She had minor faults, as well, but they play no part in this story. She let<br>Cordle buy her a cup of coffee. They were together constantly for the rest of the<br>week. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;I think I am infatuated,&quot; Cordle said to himself on the seventh day. He realized at<br>once that he had made a slight understatement. He was violently and hopelessly in<br>love. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">But what did Mavis feel? She seemed not unfond of him. It was even possible that<br>she might, conceivably, reciprocate. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">At that moment, Cordle had a flash of prescience. He realized that one week ago,<br>he had stepped on the toe of his future wife and mother of his two children, both of<br>whom would be born and brought up in a split-level house with inflatable furniture in<br>Summit, New Jersey, or possibly Millburn. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">This may sound unattractive and provincial when stated baldly; but it was desirable<br>to Cordle, who had no pretensions to cosmopolitanism. After all, not all of us can<br>live at Cap Ferrat. Strangely enough, not all of us even want to. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">That day, Cordle and Mavis went to the Marshall-Gordon Residence in Belgravia to<br>see the Byzantine miniatures. Mavis had a passion for Byzantine miniatures that<br>seemed harmless enough at the time. The collection was private, but Mavis had<br>secured invitations through a local Avis manager, who was trying very hard, indeed. </span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">They came to the Gordon Residence, an awesome Regency building in Huddlestone<br>Mews. They rang. A butler in full evening dress answered the door. They showed the<br>invitations. The butler's glance and lifted eyebrow showed that they were carrying<br>second-class invitations of the sort given to importunate art poseurs on 17-day<br>all-expense economy flights, rather than the engraved first-class invitations given to<br>Picasso, Jackie Onassis, Sugar Ray Robinson, Norman Mailer, Charles Goren, and<br>other movers and shakers of the world. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The butler said, &quot;Oh, yes.…&quot; Two words that spoke black volumes. His face twitched,<br>he looked like a man who has received an unexpected visit from Tamerlane and a<br>regiment of his Golden Horde. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;The miniatures,&quot; Cordle reminded him. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Yes, of course.… But I am afraid, sir, that no one is allowed into the Gordon<br>Residence without a coat and necktie.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">It was an oppressive August day. Cordle was wearing a sport shirt. He said, &quot;Did I<br>hear you correctly? Coat and necktie?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">The butler said, &quot;That is the rule, sir.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Mavis asked, &quot;Couldn't you make an exception this once?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The butler shook his head. &quot;We really must stick by the rules, miss. Otherwise.…&quot; He<br>left the fear of vulgarity unsaid, but it hung in the air like a chrome-plated fart. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Of course,&quot; Cordle said, pleasantly. &quot;Otherwise. So it's a coat and tie, is it? I think<br>we can arrange that.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Mavis put a hand on his arm and said, &quot;Howard, let's go. We can come back some<br>other time.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Nonsense, my dear. If I may borrow your coat.…&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">He lifted the white raincoat from her shoulders and put it on, ripping a seam. &quot;There<br>we go, mate!&quot; he said briskly to the butler. &quot;That should do it, <i>n'cest-ce pas?&quot;</i> </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;I think <i>not,&quot;</i> the butler said, in a voice bleak enough to wither artichokes. &quot;In any<br>event, there is the matter of the necktie.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Cordle had been waiting for that. He whipped out his sweaty handkerchief and<br>knotted it around his neck. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Suiting you?&quot; he leered, in an imitation of Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto, which only he<br>appreciated. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2"><i>&quot;Howard! Let's go!&quot;</i> </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Cordle waited, smiling steadily at the butler, who was sweating for the first time in<br>living memory. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;I'm afraid, sir, that that is not—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Not what?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Not precisely what was meant by coat and tie.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Are you trying to tell me,&quot; Cordle said in a loud, unpleasant voice, &quot;that you are an<br>arbiter of men's clothing as well as a door opener?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Of course not! But this impromptu attire—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;What has 'impromptu' got to do with it? Are people supposed to prepare three<br>days in advance just to pass your inspection?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;You are wearing a woman's waterproof and a soiled handkerchief,&quot; the butler</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">stated stiffly. &quot;I think there is no more to say.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">He began to close the door. Cordle said, &quot;You do that, sweetheart, and I'll have you<br>up for slander and defamation of character. Those are serious charges over here,<br>buddy, and I've got witnesses.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Aside from Mavis, Cordle had collected a small, diffident but interested crowd. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;This is becoming entirely too ridiculous,&quot; the butler said, temporizing, the door half<br>closed. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;You'll find a stretch at Wormwood Scrubs even more ridiculous,&quot; Cordle told him. &quot;I<br>intend to persecute—I mean prosecute.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2"><i>&quot;Howard!&quot;</i> cried Mavis. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">He shook off her hand and fixed the butler with a piercing glance. He said, &quot;I am<br>Mexican, though perhaps my excellent grasp of the English has deceived you. In my<br>country, a man would cut his own throat before letting such an insult pass<br>unavenged. A woman's coat, you say? <i>Hombre,</i> when I wear a coat, it becomes a<br><i>man's</i> coat. Or do you imply that I am a <i>maricón,</i> a—how do you say<br>it?—homosexual?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The crowd—becoming less modest—growled approval. Nobody except a lord loves a<br>butler. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;I meant no such implication,&quot; the butler said weakly. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Then it is a man's coat?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Just as you wish, sir.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Unsatisfactory! The innuendo still exists. I go now to find an officer of the law.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Wait, let's not be hasty,&quot; the butler said. His face was bloodless and his hands were<br>shaking. &quot;Your coat is a man's coat, sir.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;And what about my necktie?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">The butler made a final attempt at stopping Zapata and his blood-crazed peons. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Well, sir, a handkerchief is demonstrably—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;What I wear around my neck,&quot; Cordle said coldly, &quot;becomes what it is intended to<br>be. If I wore a piece of figured silk around my throat, would you call it ladies'<br>underwear? Linen is a suitable material for a tie, <i>verdad?</i> Function defines<br>terminology, don't you agree? If I ride to work on a cow, no one says that I am<br>mounted on a steak. Or do you detect a flaw in my argument?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;I'm afraid that I don't fully understand it.…&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Then how can you presume to stand in judgment over it?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">The crowd, which had been growing restless, now murmured approval. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Sir,&quot; cried the wretched butler, &quot;I beg of you.…&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3"><i>&quot;Otherwise,&quot;</i> Cordle said with satisfaction, &quot;I have a coat, a necktie, and an<br>invitation. Perhaps you would be good enough to show us the Byzantine<br>miniatures?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The butler opened wide the door to Pancho Villa and his tattered hordes. The last<br>bastion of civilization had been captured in less than an hour. Wolves howled along<br>the banks of the Thames, Morelos' barefoot army stabled its horses in the British<br>Museum, and Europe's long night had begun. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">Cordle and Mavis viewed the collection in silence. They didn't exchange a word until</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">they were alone and strolling through Regent's Park. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Look, Mavis,&quot; Cordle began. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;No, you look,&quot; she said. &quot;You were horrible! You were unbelievable! You were—I<br>can't find a word rotten enough for what you were! I never dreamed that you were<br>one of those sadistic bastards who get their kicks out of humiliating people!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;But, Mavis, you heard what he said to me, you heard the way—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;He was a stupid, bigoted old man,&quot; Mavis said. &quot;I thought you were not.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;But he said—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;It doesn't matter. The fact is, you were enjoying yourself!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Well, yes, maybe you're right,&quot; Cordle said. &quot;Look, I can explain.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">&quot;Not to me, you can't. Ever. Please stay away from me, Howard. Permanently. I<br>mean that.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">The future mother of his two children began to walk away, out of his life. Cordle<br>hurried after her. </span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;I'll call a cop, Howard, so help me, I will! Just leave me alone!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft1">&quot;Mavis, I love you!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">She must have heard him, but she kept on walking. She was a sweet and beautiful<br>girl and definitely, unchangeably, an onion. </span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">Cordle was never able to explain to Mavis about The Stew and about the necessity<br>for experiencing behavior before condemning it. Moments of mystical illumination are<br>seldom explicable. He <i>was</i> able to make her believe that he had undergone a brief<br>psychotic episode, unique and unprecedented and—with her—never to be repeated. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft3">They are married now, have one girl and one boy, live in a split-level house in<br>Plainfield, New Jersey, and are quite content. Cordle is visibly pushed around by<br>Fuller Brush men, fund solicitors, headwaiters and other imposing figures of<br>authority. But there is a difference. </span></DIV>
