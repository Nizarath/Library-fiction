      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">That 
        morning at the Crystal Sands Home for Assisted Living near Roseburg, Oregon, 
        was different. Mr. Anderson didn't know what it was, but he noticed it 
        at as he got out of bed, dressed, and put on his thick glasses.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        What was different? For one thing, Ed Simmons was walking up and down 
        the hallways, calling out, "Come on out! Everybody out!" </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        <img src="art/sheckley1.jpg" width="150" height="230" align="right">Simmons 
        was a burly black man, in charge of Sports and Physical Education at the 
        Home. He was invariably cheerful. But this morning he seemed to be bubbling 
        over with some unusual energy. "Everybody out!" he was calling. "This 
        is the big day!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        What day could that be, I wondered. All days were the same at the Rest 
        Home, where you came to die with dignity, out of sight of your friends 
        and family. Had Simmons acquired a new croquet set for us? It scarcely 
        seemed worth such enthusiasm. Was there apple pie with Miracle Whip for 
        lunch? But it was still too early for lunch. Had a state senator come 
        to call, to remind us that we were what America was all about? </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Come 
        on, Mr. Anderson," my nurse, Miss McGinnis, said. "Stop thinking! It's 
        time for doing!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Do what? What on Earth was the staff so excited about? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I decided to find out. Usually I lounge around in my bathrobe half the 
        morning, but today I came out of my room, with the help of my aluminum 
        walker. I got down the hall just fine, and then down the broad steps that 
        led to the main recreation area. My legs weren't so bad this morning. 
        Everyone else was there, too. Even Margie Boynton was there, and she had 
        seemed on the verge of death last night when her cancer kicked up.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        She peered at me with her big blue bloodshot eyes. "What's happening, 
        Mr. Anderson? What on earth is going on?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Don't 
        know, expect we'll find out soon."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        We went down the hall, past the cooking area, with its smell of turnips, 
        and out the big wooden doors and onto the porch. We were all there--the 
        men mostly in old, highly pressed suits of an unfashionable cut, their 
        black plastic spectacles perched on their noses, the women in their voluminous 
        dresses in pale blues, whites and yellows, wearing their bone-colored 
        orthopedic shoes, most of them with purses, some of them wheeling their 
        oxygen bottles, others clutching their drip stacks, with the needles still 
        in their arms. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="art/sheckley2.jpg" width="150" height="154" align="right">"This 
        is it!" Simmons was crying. "Oh, Lordie, the day has come! Praise the 
        Lord, it's here at last!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        is the fool talking about?" Mr. Smith asked me. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No 
        idea," I said. "He's probably drunk."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        We followed their cries and gestures, down the steps, down the paved sidewalk, 
        and walking faster than we usually do, limping along with our canes and 
        walkers, down to the end of the sidewalk and onto the lawn, and then across 
        the lawn toward the little group of maples at the end of the property. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        We got there, most of us out of breath, forcing ourselves to move on tired 
        legs and ailing bodies. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Margie peered at me with her big blue bloodshot eyes. "What's happening, 
        Mr. Anderson?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Don't 
        know, expect we'll find out soon."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This 
        is it!" Simmons was shouting. "It's the big day, the one you've been waiting 
        for!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        is the fool talking about?" Mr. Smith asked me. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No 
        idea. Doubt he knows."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        All of the staff were skipping around, filled with an energy we had never 
        seen before. I wondered if they had been granted a pay increase. The only 
        thing worse than the way the elderly are treated around here is the way 
        those who care for them are treated. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        <img src="art/sheckley3.jpg" width="150" height="176" align="right">Beyond 
        the clump of trees there had always been a high masonry wall that marked 
        the limits of the Rest Home property. There was no wall there now. The 
        meadowland, greener than I remember it and covered with bright little 
        flowers, ran on until it reached distant dim blue mountains. Where had 
        they come from? Was this what they had called us out for? To see this 
        extension of the Rest Home property? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        We stopped where the wall had been, uncertain if we should proceed.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Keep 
        on going!" Mr. Simmons called out. "The best is yet to come!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Hadn't 
        that been a line from some old poem? I hadn't known Mr. Simmons knew any 
        poetry. Only calisthenics. And wasn't that Nurse Quinlan reciting lines 
        from a Tennyson poem? "Here are cool mosses deep, and through the moss 
        the ivy creeps, and from the rocky cliff the poppy hangs in sleep."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It was then I became aware of the music. I don't know when it began. Maybe 
        when I got outdoors, or when I came out of my room, or even earlier, it 
        might have started in my sleep. You know how a song can just turn over 
        and over in your mind, and you're not even aware of it for a long time? 
        That's what this was like. But this was no simple song. This was a symphony 
        of voices, a male chorus and a female chorus, and they were singing or 
        chanting at each other, and sometimes both choruses sang together. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        And at the same time, they weren't voices at all. They were instruments, 
        and they were playing a great song of joy and praise. You had to smile 
        to hear that music. It made all of your fears and doubts seem foolish 
        indeed.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I became aware that the others were listening to something, too. The faces 
        of those old people were ecstatic and beautiful, and maybe my face was, 
        too. </font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I don't know when the first moment of doubt began. Maybe it was when we 
        noticed Mr. Simmons lying on the grass. His face was twisted and he was 
        crying. "It isn't fair," he was saying. "We should be allowed to go, too! 
        What'll they do without us?" One of the nurses was trying to comfort him, 
        but he appeared inconsolable. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        That told us something was not right. But was it not right with him, or 
        with the situation in general? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Or maybe my doubt began when the great chorus began to go sour, when we 
        began to hear false notes, disharmonies, when strange little rhythms began 
        to appear in the stately forward marching beat of the main theme. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Whatever it was, the foremost man--that was me--came to a sudden stop. 
        The others all stopped behind me.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What's 
        the matter, Mr. Anderson?" a woman asked me.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I didn't turn to face her. But I said, "This whole situation is screwy. 
        Someone's fooling around with us. It's another defeat. Another broken 
        promise."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Who 
        is doing it, Mr. Anderson?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's 
        got to be the government again, and all the helpful organizations. They've 
        decided to help us again. They've prepared this little outing for us. 
        Only they didn't get it quite right, did they? The song has gone bad. 
        Even the lighting is wrong.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The fine day had turned dark, with storm clouds rising, and a lurid yellow 
        band around the horizon.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"He's 
        right," the woman said, and others nodded. I must have been speaking in 
        a loud voice. One by one they began to turn away, to start walking back 
        to the Rest Home. Some of them were crying.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I realized then that I had said the wrong thing. I had killed hope. Even 
        if what I said was true, I should never have said it. What was there back 
        in the sanitarium but death and television? At least by going on we had 
        a chance.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Hey!" 
        shouted. "I was only kidding!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They 
        hesitated, not sure what to make of what I was saying.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You 
        folks going back to your Oreos and milk? I'm going on. Even if it's false, 
        this is the best thing that ever happened to me."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I marched toward the end of the meadow.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Glancing over my shoulder, I saw that all the old-timers were coming with 
        me. The Rest home staff were waving at us. We waved back, but we kept 
        on going.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I stepped off the Rest Home property. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I guess you think I'm going to tell you it was all a dream? Wrong. What 
        I'm going to tell you is that after I left the property, I found myself 
        in a small plain room with a table, a chair and a computer. On the computer 
        screen were the words: "Write what happened to you. Then exit to your 
        left." </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        So now I've told you what happened to me. And now I'm going to exit to 
        my left. If I ever get a chance to write you about what happens next, 
        rest assured you'll be the first to hear about it. </font></p>
