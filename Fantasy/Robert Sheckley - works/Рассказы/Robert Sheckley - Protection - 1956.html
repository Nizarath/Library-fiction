<DIV style="margin-left:327"><span class="ft0"><b>Protection</b></span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:277"><span class="ft1"><b>by Robert Sheckley</b></span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">There'll be an airplane crash in Burma next week, but it shouldn't affect me here in New York. And the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">feegs certainly can't harm me. Not with all my closet doors closed. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">No, the big problem is lesnerizing. I must not lesnerize. Absolutely not. As you can imagine, that hampers</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">me. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">And to top it all, I think I'm catching a really nasty cold. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">The whole thing started on the evening of November seventh. I was walking down Broadway on my way to</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">Baker's Cafeteria. On my lips was a faint smile, due to having passed a tough physics exam earlier in the day. In<br>my pocket, jingling faintly, were five coins, three keys, and a book of matches. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Just to complete the picture, let me add that the wind was from the northwest at five miles an hour, Venus</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">was in the ascendancy and the moon was decidedly gibbous. You can draw your own conclusions from this. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I reached the corner of 98th Street and began to cross. As I stepped off the curb, someone yelled at me,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">&quot;The truck! Watch the truck!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I jumped back, looking around wildly. There was nothing in sight. Then, a full second later, a truck cut</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">around the corner on two wheels, ran through the red light and roared up Broadway. Without the warning, I<br>would have been hit. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:369"><span class="ft2">· · · · · </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">You've heard stories like this, haven't you? About the strange voice that warned Aunt Minnie to stay out of the<br>elevator, which then crashed to the basement. Or maybe it told Uncle Joe not to sail on the <i>Titanic.</i> That's<br>where the story usually ends. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I wish mine ended there. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Thanks, friend,&quot; I said and looked around. There was no one there. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Can you still hear me?&quot; the voice asked. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Sure I can.&quot; I turned a complete circle and stared suspiciously at the closed apartment windows overhead.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">&quot;But where in the blue blazes are you?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Gronish,&quot; the voice answered. &quot;Is that the referent? Refraction index. Creature of insubstantiality. The</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">Shadow knows. Did I pick the right one?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;You're invisible?&quot; I hazarded. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;That's it!&quot; </span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;But <i>what</i> are you?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;A validusian derg.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;A what?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I am—open your larynx a little wider please. Let me see now. I am the Spirit of Christmas Past. The</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">Creature from the Black Lagoon. The Bride of Frankenstein. The—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Hold on,&quot; I said. &quot;What are you trying to tell me—that you're a ghost or a creature from another planet?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Same thing,&quot; the derg replied. &quot;Obviously.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">That made is all perfectly clear. Any fool could see that the voice belonged to someone from another</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">planet. He was invisible on Earth, but his superior senses had spotted an approaching danger and warned me of<br>it. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Just a plain, everyday supernormal incident. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I began to walk hurriedly down Broadway. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;What is the matter?&quot; the invisible derg asked. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Not a thing,&quot; I answered, &quot;except that I seem to be standing in the middle of the street talking to an</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">invisible alien from the farthest reaches of outer space. I suppose only I can hear you?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Well, naturally.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Great! You know where this sort of thing will land me?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;The concept you are sub-vocalizing is not entirely clear.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;The loony bin. Nut house. Bug factory. Psychotic ward. That's where they put people who talk to invisible</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">aliens. Thanks for the warning, buddy. Good night.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:369"><span class="ft2">· · · · · </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">Feeling lightheaded, I turned east, hoping my invisible friend would continue down Broadway. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Won't you talk with me?&quot; the derg asked. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I shook my head, a harmless gesture they can't pick you up for, and kept on walking. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;But you <i>must,&quot;</i> the derg said with a hint of desperation. &quot;A real sub-vocal contact is very rare and</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">astonishingly difficult. Sometimes I can get across a warning, just before a danger moment. But then the<br>connection fades.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">So there was the explanation for Aunt Minnie's premonition. But I still wasn't having any. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Conditions might not be right again for a hundred years!&quot; the derg mourned. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">What conditions? Five coins and three keys jingling together when Venus was ascendant? I suppose it's</span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">worthy of investigation—but not by me. You never can prove that supernormal stuff. There are enough people<br>knitting slipcovers for straitjackets without me swelling their ranks. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Just leave me alone,&quot; I said. A cop gave me a funny look for that one. I grinned boyishly and hurried on. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I appreciate your social situation,&quot; the derg urged, &quot;but this contact is in your own best interests. I want to</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">protect you from the myriad dangers of human existence.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I didn't answer him. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Well,&quot; the derg said, &quot;I can't force you. I'll just have to offer my services elsewhere. Goodbye, friend.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I nodded pleasantly. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;One last thing,&quot; he said. &quot;Stay off subways tomorrow between noon and one-fifteen P.M. Goodbye.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Huh? Why?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Someone will be killed at Columbus Circle, pushed in front of a train by shopping crowds. You, if you are</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">there. Goodbye.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Someone will be killed there tomorrow?&quot; I asked. &quot;You're sure?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Of course.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;It'll be in the newspapers?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I should imagine so.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;And you know all sorts of stuff like that?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I can perceive all dangers radiating toward you and extending into time. My one desire is to protect you</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">from them.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I had stopped. Two girls were giggling at me talking to myself. Now I began walking again. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Look,&quot; I whispered, &quot;can you wait until tomorrow evening?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;You will let me be your protector?&quot; the derg asked eagerly. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I'll tell you tomorrow,&quot; I said. &quot;After I read the late papers.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:369"><span class="ft2">· · · · · </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">The item was there, all right. I read it in my furnished room on 113th Street. Man pushed by the crowd, lost his<br>balance, fell in front of an oncoming train. This gave me a lot to think about while waiting for my invisible<br>protector to show up. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I didn't know what to do. His desire to protect me seemed genuine enough. But I didn't know if I wanted it.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">When, an hour later, the derg contacted me, I liked the whole idea even less, and told him so. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Don't you trust me?&quot; he asked. </span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I just want to lead a normal life.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;If you lead any life at all,&quot; he reminded me. &quot;That truck last night—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;That was a freak, a once-in-a-lifetime hazard.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;It only takes once in a lifetime to die,&quot; the derg said solemnly. &quot;There was the subway, too.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;That doesn't count. I hadn't planned on riding it today.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;But you had no reason <i>not</i> to ride it. That's the important thing. Just as you have no reason not to take a</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">shower in the next hour.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Why shouldn't I?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;A Miss Flynn,&quot; the derg said, &quot;who lives down the hall, has just completed her shower and has left a bar of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">melting pink soap on the pink tile in the bathroom on this floor. <i>You</i> would have slipped on it and suffered a<br>sprained wrist.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Not fatal, huh?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;No. Hardly in the same class with, let us say, a heavy flower-pot pushed from a rooftop by a certain</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">unstable old gentleman.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;When is that going to happen?&quot; I asked. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I thought you weren't interested.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I'm very interested. When? Where?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Will you let me continue to protect you?&quot; he asked. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Just tell me one thing,&quot; I said. &quot;What's in this for you?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Satisfaction!&quot; he said. &quot;For a validusian derg, the greatest thrill possible is to aid another creature evade</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">danger.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;But isn't there something else you want out of it? Some trifle like my soul, or rulership of Earth?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Nothing! To accept payment for Protecting would ruin the emotional experience. All I want out of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">life—all any derg wants—is to protect someone from the dangers he cannot see, but which we can see all too<br>well.&quot; The derg paused, then added softly, &quot;We don't even expect gratitude.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Well, that clinched it. How could I guess the consequences? How could I know that his aid would lead me</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">into a situation in which I must not lesnerize? </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;What about that flowerpot?&quot; I asked. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;It will be dropped on the corner of Tenth Street and McAdams Boulevard at eight-thirty tomorrow</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">morning.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Tenth and McAdams? Where's that?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;In Jersey City,&quot; he answered promptly. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;But I've never been to Jersey City in my life! Why warn me about that?&quot; </span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I don't know where you will or won't go,&quot; the derg said. &quot;I merely perceive dangers to you wherever they</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">may occur.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;What should I do now?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Anything you wish,&quot; he told me. &quot;Just lead your normal life.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Normal life. Hah! </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:369"><span class="ft2">· · · · · </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">It started out well enough. I attended classes at Columbia, did homework, saw movies, went on dates, played<br>table tennis and chess, all as before. At no time did I let on that I was under the direct protection of a validusian<br>derg. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Once or twice a day, the derg would come to me. He would say something like, &quot;Loose grating on West</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">End Avenue between 66th and 67th Streets. Don't walk on it.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">And of course I wouldn't. But someone else would. I often saw these items in the newspapers. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Once I got used to it, it gave me quite a feeling of security. An alien was scurrying around twenty-four</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">hours a day and all he wanted out of life was to protect me. A supernormal bodyguard! The thought gave me a<br>enormous amount of confidence. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">My social life, during this period, couldn't have been improved upon. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">But the derg soon became overzealous in my behalf. He began finding more and more dangers, most of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">which had no real bearing on my life in New York—things I should avoid in Mexico City, Toronto, Omaha,<br>Papeete. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I finally asked him if he was planning on reporting every potential danger on Earth. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;These are the few, the very few, that you are or may be affected by,&quot; he told me. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;In Mexico City? And Papeete? Why not confine yourself to the local picture? Greater New York, say.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Locale means nothing to me,&quot; the derg replied stubbornly. &quot;My perceptions are temporal, not spatial. I</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">must protect you from <i>everything!&quot;</i> </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">It was rather touching, in a way, and there was nothing I could do about it. I simply had to discard from his</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">reports the various dangers in Hoboken, Thailand, Kansas City, Angkor Wat (collapsing statue), Paris, and<br>Sarasota. Then I would reach the local stuff. I would ignore, for the most part, the dangers awaiting me in<br>Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, and Brooklyn, and concentrate on Manhattan. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">These were often worth waiting for, however. The derg saved me from some pretty nasty experiences—a</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">holdup on Cathedral Parkway, for example, a teen-age mugging, a fire. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:369"><span class="ft2">· · · · · </span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">But he kept stepping up the pace. It had started as a report or two a day. Within a month, he was warning me<br>five or six times a day. And at last his warnings, local, national, and international, flowed in a continual stream. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I was facing too many dangers, beyond all reasonable probability. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">On a typical day: </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Tainted food in Baker's Cafeteria. Don't eat there tonight.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Amsterdam Bus 312 has bad brakes. Don't ride it.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Mellen's Tailor Shop has a leaking gas line. Explosion due. Better have your clothes dry-cleaned</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">elsewhere.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Rabid mongrel on the prowl between Riverside Drive and Central Park West. Take a taxi.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Soon I was spending most of my time not doing things, and avoiding places. Danger seemed to be lurking</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">behind every lamp post, waiting for me. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I suspected the derg of padding his report. It seemed the only possible explanation. After all, I had lived this</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">long before meeting him, with no supernormal assistance whatsoever, and had gotten by nicely. Why should<br>the risks increase now? </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I asked him that one evening. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;All my reports are perfectly genuine,&quot; he said, obviously a little hurt. &quot;If you don't believe me, try turning</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">on the lights in your psychology class tomorrow.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Why?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Defective wiring.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I don't doubt your warnings,&quot; I assured him. &quot;I just know that life was never this dangerous before you came</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">along.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Of course it wasn't. Surely you know that if you accept protection, you must accept the drawbacks of</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">protection as well.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Drawbacks like what?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">The derg hesitated. &quot;Protection begets the need of further protection. That is a universal constant.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Come again?&quot; I asked in bewilderment. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Before you met me, you were like everyone else and you ran such risks as your situation offered. But with</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">my coming, your immediate environment has changed. And your position in it has changed, too.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Changed? Why?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Because it has <i>me</i> in it. To some extent now, you partake of my environment, just as I partake of yours.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">And, of course, it is well known that the avoidance of one danger opens the path to others.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Are you trying to tell me,&quot; I said, very slowly, &quot;that my risks have increased <i>because</i> of your help?&quot; </span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;It was unavoidable,&quot; he sighed. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:369"><span class="ft2">· · · · · </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">I could have cheerfully strangled the derg at that moment, if he hadn't been invisible and impalpable. I had the<br>angry feeling that I had been conned, taken by an extraterrestrial trickster. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;All right,&quot; I said, controlling myself. &quot;Thanks for everything. See you on Mars or wherever you hang out.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;You don't want any further protection?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;You guessed it. Don't slam the door on your way out.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;But what's wrong?&quot; The derg seemed genuinely puzzled. &quot;There are increased risks in your life, true, but</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">what of it? It is a glory and an honor to face danger and emerge victorious. The greater the peril, the greater the<br>joy of evading it.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">For the first time, I saw how alien this alien was. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Not for me,&quot; I said. &quot;Scram.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Your risks have increased,&quot; the derg argued, &quot;but my capacity for detection is more than ample to cope</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">with it. I am <i>happy</i> to cope with it. So it still represents a net gain in protection for you.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I shook my head. &quot;I know what happens next. My risks just keep on increasing, don't they?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Not at all. As far as accidents are concerned, you have reached the quantitative limit.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;What does that mean?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;It means there will be no further increase in the number of accidents you must avoid.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Good. Now will you please get the hell out of here?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;But I just explained—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Sure, no further increase, just more of the same. Look, if you leave me alone, my original environment</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">will return, won't it? And, with it, my original risks?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Eventually,&quot; the derg agreed. &quot;If you survive.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I'll take that chance.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">The derg was silent for a time. Finally he said, &quot;You can't afford to send me away. Tomorrow—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Don't tell me. I'll avoid the accidents on my own.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I wasn't thinking of accidents.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;What then?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I hardly know how to tell you.&quot; He sounded embarrassed. &quot;I said there would be no further quantitative</span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">change. But I didn't mention a <i>qualitative</i> change.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:369"><span class="ft2">· · · · · </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I shouted at him. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I'm trying to say,&quot; the derg said, &quot;that a gamper is after you.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;A what? What kind of gag is this?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;A gamper is a creature from <i>my</i> environment. I suppose he was attracted by your increased potentiality for</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">avoiding risk, due to my protection.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;To hell with the gamper and to hell with you.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;If he comes, try driving him off with mistletoe. Iron is often effective, if bonded to copper. Also—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I threw myself on the bed and buried my head under the pillow. The derg took the hint. In a moment, I could</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">sense that he was gone. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">What an idiot I had been! We denizens of Earth have a common vice: we take what we're offered, whether</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">we need it or not. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">You can get into a lot of trouble that way. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">But the derg was gone and the worst of my troubles were over. I'd sit tight for a while, give things a chance</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">to work themselves out. In a few weeks, perhaps, I'd.… </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">There seemed to be a humming in the air. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I sat upright on the bed. One corner of the room was curiously dark and I could feel a cold breeze on my</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">face. The hum grew louder—not really a hum, but laughter, low and monotonous. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">At that point, no one had to draw me a diagram. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Derg!&quot; I screamed. &quot;Get me out of this!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">He was there. &quot;Mistletoe! Just wave it at the gamper.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Where in blazes would I get mistletoe?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Iron and copper then!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I leaped to my desk, grabbed a copper paperweight and looked wildly for some iron to bond it to. The</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">paperweight was pulled out of my hand. I caught it before it fell. Then I saw my fountain pen and brought the<br>point against the paperweight. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">The darkness vanished. The cold disappeared. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I guess I passed out. </span></DIV>

<DIV style="margin-left:369"><span class="ft2">· · · · · </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">The derg said triumphantly, an hour later, &quot;You see? You need my protection.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I suppose I do,&quot; I answered dully. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;You will need some things,&quot; the derg said. &quot;Wolfsbane, amarinth, garlic, graveyard mold—&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;But the gamper is gone.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Yes. However, the grailers remain. And you need safeguards against the leeps, the feegs, and the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">melgerizer.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">So I wrote down his list of herbs, essences, and specifics. I didn't bother asking him about this link between</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">supernatural and supernormal. My comprehension was now full and complete. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Ghosts and spirits? Or extraterrestrials? All the same, he said, and I saw what he meant. They leave us</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">alone, for the most part. We are on different levels of perception, of existence, even. Until a human is foolish<br>enough to attract attention to himself. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Now I was in their game. Some wanted to kill me, some to protect me, but none care for <i>me,</i> not even the</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">derg. They were interested solely in my value to the game, if that's what it was. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">And the situation was my own fault. At the beginning, I had had the accumulated wisdom of the human race</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">at my disposal, that tremendous racial hatred of witches and ghosts, the irrational fear of alien life. For my<br>adventure has been played out a thousand times and the story is told again and again—how a man dabbles in<br>strange arts and calls to himself a spirit. By so doing, he attracts attention to himself—the worst thing of all. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">So I was welded inseparably to the derg and the derg to me. Until yesterday, that is. Now I am on my own</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">again. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">Things had been quiet for a few weeks. I had held off the feegs by the simple expedient of keeping my</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft4">closet doors closed. The leeps were more menacing, but the eye of a toad seemed to stop them. And the<br>melgerizer was dangerous only in the full of the Moon. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;You are in danger,&quot; the derg said yesterday. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Again?&quot; I asked, yawning. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;It is the thrang who pursues us.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Us?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Yes, myself as well as you, for even a derg must run risk and danger.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Is this thrang particularly dangerous?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Very.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Well, what do I do? Snakeskin over the door? A pentagon?&quot; </span></DIV>

</STYLE>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;None of those,&quot; the derg said. &quot;The thrang must be dealt with negatively, by the avoidance of certain</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">actions.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">By now, there were so many restrictions on me, I didn't think another would matter. &quot;What shouldn't I do?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;You must not lesnerize,&quot; the derg said. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Lesnerize?&quot; I frowned. &quot;What's that?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Surely you know. It is a simple, everyday human action.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;I probably know it under a different name. Explain.&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Very well. To lesnerize is to—&quot; He stopped abruptly. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;What?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;It is here! The thrang!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I backed up against a wall. I thought I could detect a faint stirring of dust, but that might have been no more</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">than overwrought nerves. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;Derg!&quot; I shouted. &quot;Where are you? What should I do?&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I heard a shriek and the unmistakable sound of jaws snapping. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">The derg cried, &quot;It has me!&quot; </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">&quot;What should I do?&quot; I cried again. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">There was a horrible noise of teeth grinding. Very faintly, I heard the derg say, <i>&quot;Don't lesnerize!&quot;</i> </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">And then there was silence. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">So I'm sitting tight now. There'll be an airplane crash in Burma next week, but it shouldn't affect me here in</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">New York. And the feegs certainly can't harm me. Not with all my closet doors closed. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">No, the problem is lesnerizing. I must <i>not</i> lesnerize. Absolutely not. If I can keep from lesnerizing,</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">everything will pass and the chase will move elsewhere. It must! All I have to do is wait them out. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">The trouble is, I don't have any idea what lesnerizing might be. A common human action, the derg had said.</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">Well, for the time, I'm avoiding as many actions as possible. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I've caught up on some back sleep and nothing happened, so that's not lesnerizing. I went out and bought</span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:67"><span class="ft2">food, paid for it, cooked it, ate it. That wasn't lesnerizing. I wrote this report. <i>That</i> wasn't lesnerizing. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I'll come out of this yet. </span></DIV>
<DIV style="margin-left:86"><span class="ft2">I'm going to catch a nap. I think I have a cold coming on. Now I have to sneez </span></DIV>
