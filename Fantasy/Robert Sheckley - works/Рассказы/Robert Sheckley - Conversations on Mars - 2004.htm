        ON MARS<br>
        </font></b> <font size="5">By Robert Sheckley</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><img src="art/sheckley1.jpg" width="450" height="313"></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        ship came down in a flurry of red dust, which the pilots saw through their 
        tinted windscreens. The added correction of their tinted sunglasses made 
        the dust appear green-gray. There was a moral to this, but it was not 
        immediately apparent.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        In the main cabin, the passengers sat in long rows, in state-of-the-art 
        chairs that permitted all postures. Each seat was equipped with a small 
        television monitor that could swing out on the release of a catch. These 
        monitors replaced windows, which were deemed superfluous. The fact that 
        everything that happened outside was not shown in its true colors was 
        considered unimportant. There was a moral to this, too.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The two men in BC-112 and BC-113 looked at each other. Piotr spoke. "Ivan 
        Makhailovich," he said, "we have landed on Mars."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"So 
        it would seem, Piotr Dembrosky," the other responded.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And 
        soon we will disembark," Piotr added.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Ivan shrugged. "Maybe, maybe not. It is not inconceivable that they will 
        start the engines again and fly us back to Earth."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Most 
        unlikely. This landing is the end-result of long and careful planning. 
        And now we are here, and can consider ourselves Martians."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        detect a note of triumph in your voice, Piotr. Do you really think it 
        is a great thing to come to Mars?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Piotr looked at him in amazement. "Is it not, then, a triumph for the 
        human race? And a rare expression of the indomitable Russian spirit?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"If 
        you say so, Piotr."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        do say so! Ivan, consider, our ancestors worked for this day. Now it is 
        here at last!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Ivan shrugged. He looked unwell, miserable in fact. There was a greenish 
        tinge to his fair skin. His lips were liverish beneath a large shaggy 
        moustache that gave him a resemblance to a young Freidrich Nietzsche. 
        His eyes were bloodshot.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Piotr resented Ivan for looking so bad. Ivan's appearance seemed a commentary 
        on the entire Mars enterprise, the great adventure that had taken them 
        far from their ancestral village near Omsk, out into the greater world 
        of the solar system, to be a part of mankind's expansion into the universe.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The spaceship came to a complete stop. People around them were unstrapping, 
        getting out of their seats, folding their complimentary in-space magazines 
        and putting them in their pockets. Some were wrestling luggage out of 
        the overhead compartments. Others were already in the isles, shuffling 
        toward the exits.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They 
        are leaving!' Piotr said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"So 
        they are."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Let 
        us join them?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You 
        always were a joiner, weren't you?" Ivan said. "Someone gets off a spaceship, 
        you want to get off, too."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What's 
        the harm in that?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Sheep 
        to the slaughter!' Ivan said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"There 
        is no slaughter here," Piotr said. "Merely an orderly procession going 
        out to the new land. Come, let us join them."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        am perfectly comfortable right here." Ivan said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"How 
        can you say that? You were complaining only last night that your back 
        ached!" Piotr said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        has that to do with leaving this perfectly comfortable ship? And besides, 
        how do we know this is Mars? Have you seen any signs or billboards? Maybe 
        the ships made an unscheduled stop at a satellite."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We 
        already stopped at a satellite. Don't you remember? We took on fuel, food."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The 
        satellite's version of Chicken Kiev is not what I would call food," Ivan 
        said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        didn't like it much, either," Piotr said. "What I want is some fish, but 
        there's no fresh fish on the satellites or on Mars. They have a water 
        shortage, you know."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"How 
        much water does it take to fill a tank with fish?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        And then the spaceship captain himself, Ilya Schmirensky, came out of 
        the pilot's compartment.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What's 
        this?" Schmirensky said. "Why haven't you men left the ship?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'm 
        waiting for him," Piotr said, pointing to Ivan.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'm 
        waiting for I don't know what," Ivan said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Listen, 
        boys, Schmirensky said, "you have to get out. I need to get this ship 
        into space again, back to Earth to pick up another load. I can't hold 
        things up because a couple of men are frightened of a new planet."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Who's 
        frightened?" Ivan said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It 
        must be you," the captain said. "It obviously isn't me. I have done what 
        I was hired to do, what I was trained to do. I have brought our ship to 
        the Red Planet."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You're 
        an executive, you have special privileges, that's why you have no fear. 
        And we were told Mars was red, but look, it's grayish-green." Ivan pointed 
        to the TV screen.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That's 
        a natural color distortion," the captain said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And 
        what other natural distortions are we likely to encounter?" Ivan demanded.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Just then a man appeared behind the captain. He had a camera held up to 
        his eye and was filming everything.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The 
        camera is rolling!" the captain said. "Get off, this is shameful."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"If 
        you don't want to see it," Ivan said, "let them edit the film."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Not 
        one inch of film will be omitted," the captain declared. "We will show 
        this disembarkation in its entirety, no matter how long it takes."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's 
        taking too long,' the cameraman said. "We're running out of film."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"He's 
        lying,' Ivan said. "It is a video camera, it's filled with an endless 
        supply of video tape."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Nothing 
        is endless," the cameraman said. "Not even video tape."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Do 
        you know what I think?" Ivan said. "I think we have never left Earth. 
        We have been circling some big desert for months and months-the Sahara, 
        perhaps. And now our masters have ordered us to land. We are to be sold 
        as indentured labor to the Arabs! That's what I think."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Absurd," 
        the captain said. "There's not an Arab within ten million miles of here."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You 
        look a little Arab yourself, Captain," Ivan said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        am Georgian."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Aha!' 
        cried Ivan.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Aha 
        what?'</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Never 
        mind," Ivan said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Excuse 
        me," the cameraman said to the captain. "This man is crazy, but not completely 
        crazy. It is common knowledge that a great mass of negative energy has 
        accumulated around Mars. A leading cosmonautical expert recently explained 
        that Astrogation was finding it increasingly difficult to find windows 
        of opportunity through the dense cover of information that occludes and 
        distorts so much of space. We could be anywhere."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        heard that too," a voice behind the cameraman said. He was a shock-haired 
        young man with a large camera bag slung over his shoulders. He was the 
        assistant cameraman..</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"My 
        name is Misha,' he said. "I have been listening to your discussion with 
        interest. It occurred to me that once upon a time oxymorons and unusual 
        juxtapositions charmed us. But we would have been amazed to see a man 
        with a parrot for an arm, like that fellow over there."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Misha gestured at the TV screen. It showed a tall man in dark clothing, 
        who seemed to be waiting for a bus. He was in no respect unusual except 
        that his left arm terminated in a parrot.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Startling, 
        you think," Misha went on. But there have been articles on this in several 
        magazines on Earth. CNN ran a special on it not too long ago. Psychic 
        psittacosis, I believe they called it. It first sprang up in Madagascar, 
        or maybe it was Dahomey. Africans are subject to this sort of thing. It 
        is an objectification of hysteria."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Sasha, the cameraman, said, "How can you know this, Misha? You have proven 
        to my satisfaction that there exists an impenetrable sphere of unknowingness. 
        But we are within that cloud, so how can you know about it?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Sasha said, "We know it because we are Russians, my friend. This sort 
        of talk is mother's milk to us. What we're dealing with here is the veritable 
        context of science fiction. Once this context was the possession of the 
        English-speaking races. Only they could think in science fiction. But 
        we Russians have always had certain advantages in the thinking and speculating 
        departments, and so now we have surpassed them."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"How 
        do you suppose the present state of affairs came about?" Piotr asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Physics 
        has shown that something is always born of nothing. Not just some of the 
        time, but always and exclusively. And what else could something be born 
        from if not nothing?</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"So 
        nothing is real?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"On 
        the contrary," Ivan said, suddenly joining the conversation, "everything 
        is real. But we are not equipped to react to it, because reality has entered 
        the sphere of the banal, which by definition is not worthy of consideration. 
        But now we are bound by some categorical imperative to examine even the 
        previously unnoticed banal."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Bravo," 
        Ivan," Piotr said. "It took a lot of courage to say that. About the man 
        with a parrot for an arm--did you notice he is smoking a cigarette with 
        his parrot?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"How 
        very Russian of him!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The captain now said, in a loud and annoyed voice, "You men!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes, 
        sir!" Piotr and Ivan replied almost simultaneously.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Enough 
        playing around. Have you received your assignment papers yet?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No, 
        sir," Ivan said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The captain took two papers out of his pocket and handed one to each man.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Take 
        these outside with you. Show them to the sergeant. He will assign you 
        to a place in the Defense Corps. Do not concern yourselves with questions 
        of real and unreal. Just follow orders."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes 
        sir," Piotr said. "Can you tell me what we are defending against?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Don't 
        ask. There will be a lecture on it as soon as you have been assigned quarters 
        and fed."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The men nodded and moved out into the greenish-gray land of Mars.</font></p>
