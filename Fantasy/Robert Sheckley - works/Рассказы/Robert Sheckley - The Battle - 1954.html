<DIV><span class="ft0"><b>THE BATTLE</b></span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft1">by</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft0"><b>Robert Sheckley</b></span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">Supreme General Fetterer barked “At ease!” as he hurried into the command room.  Obediently, his three generals<br>stood at ease.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">“We haven’t much time,” Fetterer said, glancing at his watch.  “We’ll go over the plan of battle again.”<br>He walked to the wall and unrolled a gigantic map of the Sahara Desert.<br>“According to our best theological information, Satan is going to present his forces at these co-ordinates.”  He</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">indicated the place with a blunt forefinger.  “In the front rank there will be the devils, demons, succubi, incubi, and the<br>rest of the ratings.  Bael will command the right flank, Buer the left.  His Satanic Majesty will hold the centre.”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">“Rather medieval,” General Dell murmured.<br>General Fetterer’s aide came in, his face shining and happy with the thought of the Coming.<br>“Sir,” he said, “the priest is outside again.”<br>“Stand to attention, soldier,” Fetterer said sternly.  “There’s still a battle to be fought and won.”<br>“Yes sir,” the aide said, and stood rigidly, some of the joy fading from his face.<br>“The priest, eh?”  Supreme General Fetterer rubbed his fingers together thoughtfully.  Ever since the Coming, since</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">the knowledge of the imminent Last Battle, the religious workers of the world had made a complete nuisance of<br>themselves.  They had stopped their bickering, which was commendable.  But now they were trying to run military<br>business.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">“Send him away,” Fetterer said.  “He know we’re planning Armageddon.”<br>“Yes sir,” the aide said.  He saluted sharply, wheeled, and marched out.<br>“To go on,” Supreme General Fetterer said.  “Behind Satan’s first line of defence will be the resurrected sinners,</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">and various elemental forces of evil.  The fallen angels will act as his bomber corps.  Dell’s robot interceptors will meet<br>them.”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">General Dell smiled grimly.<br>“Upon contact, MacFee’s automatic tank corps will proceed towards the centre of the line.  MacFee’s automatic</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">tank corps will proceed towards the centre,” Fetterer went on, “supported by General Ongin’s robot infantry.  Dell will<br>command the H bombing of the rear, which should be tightly massed.  I will thrust with the mechanised cavalry, here<br>and here.”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">The aide came back, and stood rigidly at attention.  “Sir,” he said, “the priest refuses to go.  He says he must speak</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">with you.”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">Supreme General Fetterer hesitated before saying no.  He remembered that this was the Last Battle, and that the</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">religious workers <i>were</i> connected with it.  He decided to give the man five minutes.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">“Show him in,” he said.<br>The priest wore a plain business suit, to show that he represented no particular religion.  His face was tired but</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">determined.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">“General,” he said, “I am a representative of all the religious workers of the world, the priests, rabbis, ministers,</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">mullahs, and all the rest.  We beg of you, General, to let us fight in the Lord’s battle.”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">Supreme General Fetterer drummed his fingers nervously against his side.  He wanted to stay on friendly terms with</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">these men.  Even he, the Supreme Commander, might need a good word, when all was said and done …</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">“You can understand my position,” Fetterer said unhappily.  “I’m a general.  I have a battle to fight.”<br>“But it’s the Last Battle,” the priest said.  “It should be the people’s battle.”<br>“It is,” Fetterer said.  “It’s being fought by their representatives, the military.”<br>The priest didn’t look at all convinced.<br>Fetterer said, “You wouldn’t want to lose this battle, would you?  Have Satan win?”<br>“Of course not,” the priest murmured.<br>“Then we can’t take any chances,” Fetterer said.  “All the governments agreed on that, didn’t they?  Oh, it would</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">be very nice to fight Armageddon with the mass of humanity.  Symbolic, you might say.  But could we be certain of<br>victory?”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">The priest tried to say something, but Fetterer was talking rapidly.<br>“How do we know the strength of Satan’s forces?  We simply <i>must</i> put forth our best foot, militarily speaking.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">And that means the automatic armies, the robot interceptors and tanks, the H bombs.”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">The priest looked very unhappy.  “But it isn’t <i>right</i>,” he said.  “Certainly you can find some place in your plan for</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft3"><i>people</i>?”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">Fetterer thought about it, but the request was impossible.  The plan of battle was fully developed, beautiful,</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">irresistible.  Any introduction of a gross human element would only throw it out of order.  No living flesh could stand<br>the noise of that mechanical attack, the energy potentials humming in the air, the all-enveloping fire power.  A human</span></DIV>

<DIV><span class="ft2">being who came within a hundred miles of the front would not live to see the enemy.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">“I’m afraid not,” Fetterer said.<br>“There are some,” the priest said sternly, “who feel that it was an error to put this in the hands of the military.”<br>“Sorry,” Fetterer said cheerfully.  “That’s defeatist talk.  If you don’t mind –”  He gestured at the door.  Wearily the</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">priest left.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">“These civilians,” Fetterer mused.  “Well gentlemen, are your troops ready?”<br>“We’re ready to fight for Him,” General MacFee said enthusiastically.  “I can vouch for every automatic in my</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">command.  Their metal is shining, all relays have been renewed, and the energy reservoirs are fully charged.  Sir,<br>they’re positively itching for battle!”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">General Ongin snapped fully out of his daze.  “The ground troops are ready, sir!”<br>“Air arm ready,” General Dell said.<br>“Excellent,” General Fetterer said.  “All other arrangements have been made.  Television facilities are available for</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">the total population of the world.  No one, rich or poor, will miss the spectacle of the Last Battle.”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">“And after the battle –” General Ongin began, and stopped.  He looked at Fetterer.<br>Fetterer frowned deeply.  He didn’t know what was supposed to happen after the Battle.  That part of it was,</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">presumably, in the hands of the religious agencies.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">“I suppose there’ll be a presentation or something,” he said vaguely.<br>“You mean we will meet – Him?” General Dell asked.<br>“Don’t really know,” Fetterer said.  “But I should think so.  After all – I mean, you know what I mean?”<br>“But what should we wear?” General MacFee asked, in a sudden panic.  “I mean, what <i>does</i> one wear?”<br>“What do the angels wear?” Fetterer asked Ongin.<br>“I don’t know,” Ongin said.<br>“Robes, do you think?” General Dell offered.<br>“No,” Fetterer said sternly.  “We will wear dress uniform, without decorations.”<br>The generals nodded.  It was fitting.<br>And then it was time.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">Gorgeous in their battle array, the legions of Hell advanced over the desert.  Hellish pipes skirled, hollow drums</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">pounded, and the great host moved forward.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">In a blinding cloud of sand, General MacFee’s automatic tanks hurled themselves against the satanic foe. </span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">Immediately, Dell’s automatic bombers screeched overhead, hurling their bombs on the massed horde of the damned. <br>Fetterer thrust valiantly with his automatic cavalry.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">Into this mêlée advanced Ongin’s automatic infantry, and metal did what metal could.<br>The hordes of the damned overflowed the front, ripping apart tanks and robots.  Automatic mechanisms died,</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">bravely defending a patch of sand.  Dell’s bombers were torn from the skies by the fallen angels, led by Marchocias,<br>his griffin’s wings beating the air into a tornado.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">The thin battered line of robots held, against gigantic presences that smashed and scattered them, and struck terror</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">into the hearts of television viewers in homes around the world.  Like men, like heroes the robots thought, trying to<br>force back the forces of evil.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">Astaroth shrieked a command, and Behemoth lumbered forward.  Bael, with a wedge of devils behind him, threw a</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">charge at General Fetterer’s crumbling left flank.  Metal screamed, electrons howled in agony at the impact.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">Supreme General Fetterer sweated and trembled, a thousand miles behind the firing line.  But steadily, nervelessly,</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">he guided the pushing of buttons and the throwing of levers.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">His superb corps didn’t disappoint him.  Mortally damaged robots swayed to their feet and fought.  Smashed,</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">trampled, destroyed by the howling fiends, the robots managed to hold their line.  Then the veteran Fifth Corps threw<br>in a counter-attack, and the enemy front was pierced.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">A thousand miles behind the firing line, the generals guided the mopping up operations.<br>“The battle is won,” Supreme General Fetterer whispered, turning away from the television screen.  “I congratulate</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">you, gentlemen.”</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">The generals smiled wearily.<br>They looked at each other, then broke into a spontaneous shout.  Armageddon was won, and the forces of Satan</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">had been vanquished.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft4">But something was happening on their screens.<br>“Is that – is that –” General MacFee began, and then couldn’t speak.<br>For The Presence was upon the battlefield, walking among the piles of twisted, shattered metal.<br>The generals were silent.<br>The Presence touched a twisted robot.<br>Upon the smoking desert, the robots began to move.  The twisted, scored, fused metals straightened.<br>The robots stood on their feet again.<br>“MacFee,” Supreme General Fetterer whispered.  “Try your controls.  Make the robots kneel or something.”<br>The general tried, but his controls were dead.<br>The bodies of the robots began to rise in the air.  Around them were the angels of the Lord, and the robot tanks</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">and soldiers and bombers floated upward, higher and higher.</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">“He’s saving them!” Ongin cried hysterically.  “He’s saving the robots!”</span></DIV>

<DIV><span class="ft4">“It’s a mistake!” Fetterer said.  “Quick.  Send a messenger to – no!  We will go in person!”<br>And quickly a ship was commanded, and quickly they sped to the field of battle.  But by then it was too late, for</span></DIV>
<DIV><span class="ft2">Armageddon was over, and the robots gone, and the Lord and his host departed.</span></DIV>
