<h1><span class="sp1">Death Wish</span></h1>

<h2>By NED LANG</h2>

<p class="hd1"><b><big>Illustrated by WEISS</big></b></p>

<div class="bk1"><p><big><b>Compared with a spaceship in distress, going
to hell in a handbasket is roomy and slow!</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> space freighter <i>Queen
Dierdre</i> was a great, squat,
pockmarked vessel of the
Earth-Mars run and she never
gave anyone a bit of trouble. That
should have been sufficient warning
to Mr. Watkins, her engineer.
Watkins was fond of saying
that there are two kinds of equipment&mdash;the
kind that fails bit by
bit, and the kind that fails all at
once.</p>

<p>Watkins was short and red-faced,
magnificently mustached,
and always a little out of breath.
With a cigar in his hand, over a
glass of beer, he talked most cynically
about his ship, in the immemorial
fashion of engineers.
But in reality, Watkins was foolishly
infatuated with <i>Dierdre</i>,
idealized her, humanized her, and
couldn't conceive of anything serious
ever happening.</p>

<p>On this particular run, <i>Dierdre</i>
soared away from Terra at the
proper speed; Mr. Watkins signaled
that fuel was being consumed
at the proper rate; and
Captain Somers cut the engines
at the proper moment indicated
by Mr. Rajcik, the navigator.</p>

<p>As soon as Point Able had
been reached and the engines
stopped, Somers frowned and
studied his complex control
board. He was a thin and meticulous
man, and he operated his
ship with mechanical perfection.
He was well liked in the front
offices of Mikkelsen Space Lines,
where Old Man Mikkelsen pointed
to Captain Somers' reports as
models of neatness and efficiency.
On Mars, he stayed at the Officers'
Club, eschewing the stews and
dives of Marsport. On Earth, he
lived in a little Vermont cottage
and enjoyed the quiet companionship
of two cats, a Japanese
houseboy, and a wife.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">His</span> instructions read true. And
yet he sensed something
wrong. Somers knew every creak,
rattle and groan that <i>Dierdre</i>
was capable of making. During
blastoff, he had heard something
<i>different</i>. In space, something different
had to be wrong.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rajcik," he said, turning
to his navigator, "would you
check the cargo? I believe something
may have shifted."</p>

<p>"You bet," Rajcik said cheerfully.
He was an almost offensively
handsome young man with
black wavy hair, blas&eacute; blue eyes
and a cleft chin. Despite his appearance,
Rajcik was thoroughly
qualified for his position. But he
was only one of fifty thousand
thoroughly qualified men who
lusted for a berth on one of the
fourteen spaceships in existence.
Only Stephen Rajcik had had the
foresight, appearance and fortitude
to court and wed Helga, Old
Man Mikkelsen's eldest daughter.</p>

<p>Rajcik went aft to the cargo
hold. <i>Dierdre</i> was carrying transistors
this time, and microfilm
books, platinum filaments, salamis,
and other items that could
not as yet be produced on Mars.
But the bulk of her space was
taken by the immense Fahrensen
Computer.</p>

<p>Rajcik checked the positioning
lines on the monster, examined
the stays and turnbuckles
that held it in place, and returned
to the cabin.</p>

<p>"All in order, Boss," he reported
to Captain Somers, with the
smile that only an employer's
son-in-law can both manage and
afford.</p>

<p>"Mr. Watkins, do you read
anything?"</p>

<p>Watkins was at his own instrument
panel. "Not a thing, sir. I'll
vouch for every bit of equipment
in <i>Dierdre</i>."</p>

<p>"Very well. How long before
we reach Point Baker?"</p>

<p>"Three minutes, Chief," Rajcik
said.</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>The spaceship hung in the
void, all sensation of speed lost
for lack of a reference point. Beyond
the portholes was darkness,
the true color of the Universe,
perforated by the brilliant lost
points of the stars.</p>

<p>Captain Somers turned away
from the disturbing reminder of
his extreme finitude and wondered
if he could land <i>Dierdre</i>
without shifting the computer. It
was by far the largest, heaviest
and most delicate piece of equipment
ever transported in space.</p>

<p>He worried about that machine.
Its value ran into the billions
of dollars, for Mars Colony
had ordered the best possible, a
machine whose utility would offset
the immense transportation
charge across space. As a result,
the Fahrensen Computer was perhaps
the most complex and advanced
machine ever built by
Man.</p>

<p>"Ten seconds to Point Baker,"
Rajcik announced.</p>

<p>"Very well." Somers readied
himself at the control board.</p>

<p>"Four&mdash;three&mdash;two&mdash;one&mdash;fire!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Somers</span> activated the engines.
Acceleration pressed the three
men back into their couches, and
more acceleration, and&mdash;shockingly&mdash;still
more acceleration.</p>

<p>"The fuel!" Watkins yelped,
watching his indicators spinning.</p>

<p>"The course!" Rajcik gasped,
fighting for breath.</p>

<p>Captain Somers cut the engine
switch. The engines continued
firing, pressing the men deeper
into their couches. The cabin
lights flickered, went out, came
on again.</p>

<p>And still the acceleration
mounted and <i>Dierdre's</i> engines
howled in agony, thrusting the
ship forward. Somers raised one
leaden hand and inched it toward
the emergency cut-off
switch. With a fantastic expenditure
of energy, he reached the
switch, depressed it.</p>

<p>The engines stopped with dramatic
suddenness, while tortured
metal creaked and groaned. The
lights flickered rapidly, as though
<i>Dierdre</i> were blinking in pain.
They steadied and then there was
silence.</p>

<p>Watkins hurried to the engine
room. He returned morosely.</p>

<p>"Of all the damn things," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"What was it?" Captain Somers
asked.</p>

<p>"Main firing circuit. It fused
on us." He shook his head. "Metal
fatigue, I'd say. It must have
been flawed for years."</p>

<p>"When was it last checked
out?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's a sealed unit. Supposed
to outlast the ship. Absolutely
foolproof, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless it's flawed."</p>

<p>"Don't blame it on me! Those
circuits are supposed to be X-rayed,
heat-treated, fluoroscoped&mdash;you
just can't trust machinery!"</p>

<p>At last Watkins believed that
engineering axiom.</p>

<p>"How are we on fuel?" Captain
Somers asked.</p>

<p>"Not enough left to push a
kiddy car down Main Street,"
Watkins said gloomily. "If I could
get my hands on that factory inspector ..."</p>

<p>Captain Somers turned to Rajcik,
who was seated at the navigator's
desk, hunched over his
charts. "How does this affect our
course?"</p>

<p>Rajcik finished the computation
he was working on and
gnawed thoughtfully at his pencil.</p>

<p>"It kills us. We're going to
cross the orbit of Mars before
Mars gets there."</p>

<p>"How long before?"</p>

<p>"Too long. Captain, we're flying
out of the Solar System like
the proverbial bat out of hell."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Rajcik</span> smiled, a courageous,
devil-may-care smile which
Watkins found singularly inappropriate.</p>

<p>"Damn it, man," he roared,
"don't just leave it there. We've
got a little fuel left. We can turn
her, can't we? You <i>are</i> a navigator,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I am," Rajcik said icily. "And
if I computed my courses the
way you maintain your engines,
we'd be plowing through Australia
now."</p>

<p>"Why, you little company
toady! At least I got my job legitimately,
not by marrying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough!" Captain Somers
cut in.</p>

<p>Watkins, his face a mottled red,
his mustache bristling, looked like
a walrus about to charge. And
Rajcik, eyes glittering, was waiting
hopefully.</p>

<p>"No more of this," Somers said.
"I give the orders here."</p>

<p>"Then give some!" Watkins
snapped. "Tell him to plot a return
curve. This is life or death!"</p>

<p>"All the more reason for remaining
cool. Mr. Rajcik, can
you plot such a course?"</p>

<p>"First thing I tried," Rajcik
said. "Not a chance, on the fuel
we have left. We can turn a degree
or two, but it won't help."</p>

<p>Watkins said, "Of course it will!
We'll curve back into the Solar
System!"</p>

<p>"Sure, but the best curve we
can make will take a few thousand
years for us to complete."</p>

<p>"Perhaps a landfall on some
other planet&mdash;Neptune, Uranus&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rajcik shook his head. "Even
if an outer planet were in the
right place at the right time, we'd
need fuel&mdash;a lot of fuel&mdash;to get
into a braking orbit. And if we
could, who'd come get us? No
ship has gone past Mars yet."</p>

<p>"At least we'd have a chance,"
Watkins said.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Rajcik agreed indifferently.
"But we can't swing it.
I'm afraid you'll have to kiss the
Solar System good-by."</p>

<p>Captain Somers wiped his forehead
and tried to think of a plan.
He found it difficult to concentrate.
There was too great a discrepancy
between his knowledge
of the situation and its appearance.
He knew&mdash;intellectually&mdash;that
his ship was traveling out of
the Solar System at a tremendous
rate of speed. But in appearance
they were stationary, hung in the
abyss, three men trapped in a
small, hot room, breathing the
smell of hot metal and perspiration.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Captain?"
Watkins asked.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Somers</span> frowned at the engineer.
Did the man expect him
to pull a solution out of the air?
How was he even supposed to
concentrate on the problem? He
had to slow the ship, turn it. But
his senses told him that the ship
was not moving. How, then, could
speed constitute a problem?</p>

<p>He couldn't help but feel that
the real problem was to get away
from these high-strung, squabbling
men, to escape from this
hot, smelly little room.</p>

<p>"Captain! You must have some
idea!"</p>

<p>Somers tried to shake his feeling
of unreality. The problem,
the real problem, he told himself,
was how to stop the ship.</p>

<p>He looked around the fixed cabin
and out the porthole at the
unmoving stars. <i>We are moving
very rapidly</i>, he thought, unconvinced.</p>

<p>Rajcik said disgustedly, "Our
noble captain can't face the situation."</p>

<p>"Of course I can," Somers objected,
feeling very light-headed
and unreal. "I can pilot any course
you lay down. That's my only
real responsibility. Plot us a
course to Mars!"</p>

<p>"Sure!" Rajcik said, laughing.
"I can! I will! Engineer, I'm going
to need plenty of fuel for this
course&mdash;about ten tons! See that
I get it!"</p>

<p>"Right you are," said Watkins.
"Captain, I'd like to put in a requisition
for ten tons of fuel."</p>

<p>"Requisition granted," Somers
said. "All right, gentlemen, responsibility
is inevitably circular.
Let's get a grip on ourselves. Mr.
Rajcik, suppose you radio Mars."</p>

<p>When contact had been established,
Somers took the microphone
and stated their situation.
The company official at the other
end seemed to have trouble
grasping it.</p>

<p>"But can't you turn the ship?"
he asked bewilderedly. "Any kind
of an orbit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. I've just explained that."</p>

<p>"Then what do you propose to
do, Captain?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I'm asking
you."</p>

<p>There was a babble of voices
from the loudspeaker, punctuated
by bursts of static. The lights
flickered and reception began to
fade. Rajcik, working frantically,
managed to re-establish the contact.</p>

<p>"Captain," the official on Mars
said, "we can't think of a thing.
If you could swing into any sort
of an orbit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't!"</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, you
have the right to try anything at
all. Anything, Captain!"</p>

<p>Somers groaned. "Listen, I can
think of just one thing. We could
bail out in spacesuits as near
Mars as possible. Link ourselves
together, take the portable transmitter.
It wouldn't give much of
a signal, but you'd know our approximate
position. Everything
would have to be figured pretty
closely&mdash;those suits just carry
twelve hours' air&mdash;but it's a
chance."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> was a confusion of
voices from the other end.
Then the official said, "I'm sorry,
Captain."</p>

<p>"What? I'm telling you it's our
one chance!"</p>

<p>"Captain, the only ship on Mars
now is the <i>Diana</i>. Her engines
are being overhauled."</p>

<p>"How long before she can be
spaceborne?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks, at least. And a
ship from Earth would take too
long. Captain, I wish we could
think of something. About the
only thing we can suggest&mdash;"</p>

<p>The reception suddenly failed
again.</p>

<p>Rajcik cursed frustratedly as
he worked over the radio. Watkins
gnawed at his mustache.
Somers glanced out a porthole
and looked hurriedly away, for
the stars, their destination, were
impossibly distant.</p>

<p>They heard static again, faintly
now.</p>

<p>"I can't get much more," Rajcik
said. "This damned reception....
What could they have been
suggesting?"</p>

<p>"Whatever it was," said Watkins,
"they didn't think it would
work."</p>

<p>"What the hell does that matter?"
Rajcik asked, annoyed. "It'd
give us something to do."</p>

<p>They heard the official's voice,
a whisper across space.</p>

<p>"Can you hear ... Suggest ..."</p>

<p>At full amplification, the voice
faded, then returned. "Can only
suggest ... most unlikely ... but
try ... calculator ... try ..."</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="363" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>The voice was gone. And then
even the static was gone.</p>

<p>"That does it," Rajcik said.
"The calculator? Did he mean the
Fahrensen Computer in our
hold?"</p>

<p>"I see what he meant," said
Captain Somers. "The Fahrensen
is a very advanced job. No one
knows the limits of its potential.
He suggests we present our problem
to it."</p>

<p>"That's ridiculous," Watkins
snorted. "This problem has no solution."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to," Somers
agreed. "But the big computers
have solved other apparently impossible
problems. We can't lose
anything by trying."</p>

<p>"No," said Rajcik, "as long as
we don't pin any hopes on it."</p>

<p>"That's right. We don't dare
hope. Mr. Watkins, I believe this
is your department."</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use?" Watkins
asked. "You say don't hope&mdash;but
both of you are hoping anyhow!
You think the big electronic god
is going to save your lives. Well,
it's not!"</p>

<p>"We have to try," Somers told
him.</p>

<p>"We don't! I wouldn't give it
the satisfaction of turning us
down!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> stared at him in vacant
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Now you're implying that machines
think," said Rajcik.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," Watkins said.
"Because they do! No, I'm not
out of my head. Any engineer will
tell you that a complex machine
has a personality all its own. Do
you know what that personality
is like? Cold, withdrawn, uncaring,
unfeeling. A machine's only
purpose is to frustrate desire and
produce two problems for every
one it solves. And do you know
why a machine feels this way?"</p>

<p>"You're hysterical," Somers
told him.</p>

<p>"I am not. A machine feels
this way because it <i>knows</i> it is
an unnatural creation in nature's
domain. Therefore it wishes to
reach entropy and cease&mdash;a mechanical
death wish."</p>

<p>"I've never heard such gibberish
in my life," Somers said. "Are
you going to hook up that computer?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I'm a human. I
keep trying. I just wanted you to
understand <i>fully</i> that there is no
hope." He went to the cargo hold.</p>

<p>After he had gone, Rajcik
grinned and shook his head. "We'd
better watch him."</p>

<p>"He'll be all right," Somers
said.</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe not." Rajcik
pursed his lips thoughtfully. "He's
blaming the situation on a machine
personality now, trying to
absolve himself of guilt. And it
<i>is</i> his fault that we're in this spot.
An engineer is responsible for all
equipment."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you can put
the blame on him so dogmatically,"
Somers replied.</p>

<p>"Sure I can," Rajcik said. "I
personally don't care, though.
This is as good a way to die as
any other and better than most."</p>

<p>Captain Somers wiped perspiration
from his face. Again the
notion came to him that the problem&mdash;the
<i>real</i> problem&mdash;was
to find a way out of this hot,
smelly, motionless little box.</p>

<p>Rajcik said, "Death in space
is an appealing idea, in certain
ways. Imagine an entire spaceship
for your tomb! And you have
a variety of ways of actually dying.
Thirst and starvation I rule
out as unimaginative. But there
are possibilities in heat, cold, implosion,
explosion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is pretty morbid," Somers
said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I'm a</span> pretty morbid fellow,"
Rajcik said carelessly. "But
at least I'm not blaming inanimate
objects, the way Watkins
is. Or permitting myself the luxury
of shock, like you." He studied
Somers' face. "This is your
first real emergency, isn't it, Captain?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Somers answered
vaguely.</p>

<p>"And you're responding to it
like a stunned ox," Rajcik said.
"Wake up, Captain! If you can't
live with joy, at least try to extract
some pleasure from your
dying."</p>

<p>"Shut up," Somers said, with
no heat. "Why don't you read a
book or something?"</p>

<p>"I've read all the books on
board. I have nothing to distract
me except an analysis of your
character."</p>

<p>Watkins returned to the cabin.
"Well, I've activated your big
electronic god. Would anyone
care to make a burned offering
in front of it?"</p>

<p>"Have you given it the problem?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I decided to confer
with the high priest. What shall
I request of the demon, sir?"</p>

<p>"Give it all the data you can,"
Somers said. "Fuel, oxygen, water,
food&mdash;that sort of thing.
Then tell it we want to return to
Earth. Alive," he added.</p>

<p>"It'll love that," Watkins said.
"It'll get such pleasure out of rejecting
our problem as unsolvable.
Or better yet&mdash;insufficient
data. In that way, it can hint
that a solution is possible, but just
outside our reach. It can keep us
hoping."</p>

<p>Somers and Rajcik followed
him to the cargo hold. The computer,
activated now, hummed
softly. Lights flashed swiftly over
its panels, blue and white and
red.</p>

<p>Watkins punched buttons and
turned dials for fifteen minutes,
then moved back.</p>

<p>"Watch for the red light on
top," he said. "That means the
problem is rejected."</p>

<p>"Don't say it," Rajcik warned
quickly.</p>

<p>Watkins laughed. "Superstitious
little fellow, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"But not incompetent," Rajcik
said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Can't you two quit it?" Somers
demanded, and both men
turned startedly to face him.</p>

<p>"Behold!" Rajcik said. "The
sleeper has awakened."</p>

<p>"After a fashion," said Watkins,
snickering.</p>

<p>Somers suddenly felt that if
death or rescue did not come
quickly, they would kill each
other, or drive each other crazy.</p>

<p>"Look!" Rajcik said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;light</span> on the computer's
panel was flashing green.</p>

<p>"Must be a mistake," said Watkins.
"Green means the problem
is solvable within the conditions
set down."</p>

<p>"Solvable!" Rajcik said.</p>

<p>"But it's impossible," Watkins
argued. "It's fooling us, leading
us on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be superstitious," Rajcik
mocked. "How soon do we get
the solution?"</p>

<p>"It's coming now." Watkins
pointed to a paper tape inching
out of a slot in the machine's
face. "But there must be something
wrong!"</p>

<p>They watched as, millimeter
by millimeter, the tape crept out.
The computer hummed, its lights
flashing green. Then the hum
stopped. The green lights blazed
once more and faded.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Rajcik
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"It's finished," Watkins said.</p>

<p>"Pick it up! Read it!"</p>

<p>"You read it. You won't get <i>me</i>
to play its game."</p>

<p>Rajcik laughed nervously and
rubbed his hands together, but
didn't move. Both men turned
to Somers.</p>

<p>"Captain, it's your responsibility."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Captain!"</p>

<p>Somers looked with loathing at
his engineer and navigator. <i>His</i>
responsibility, everything was <i>his</i>
responsibility. Would they never
leave him alone?</p>

<p>He went up to the machine,
pulled the tape free, read it with
slow deliberation.</p>

<p>"What does it say, sir?" Rajcik
asked.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;possible?" Watkins
urged.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Somers said. "It's
possible." He laughed and looked
around at the hot, smelly, low-ceilinged
little room with its
locked doors and windows.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Rajcik shouted.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Somers</span> said, "You figured a
few thousand years to return
to the Solar System, Rajcik?
Well, the computer agrees with
you. Twenty-three hundred years,
to be precise. Therefore, it has
given us a suitable longevity
serum."</p>

<p>"Twenty-three hundred years,"
Rajcik mumbled. "I suppose we
hibernate or something of the
sort."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Somers said calmly.
"As a matter of fact, this serum
does away quite nicely with
the need for sleep. We stay awake
and watch each other."</p>

<p>The three men looked at one
another and at the sickeningly
familiar room smelling of metal
and perspiration, its sealed doors
and windows that stared at an
unchanging spectacle of stars.</p>

<p>Watkins said, "Yes, that's the
sort of thing it would do."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
