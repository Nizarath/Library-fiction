      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        have done a lot of things in this lifetime. But the strangest of them 
        is what I am doing now. I am going to be to be your reporter on one of 
        the great current mysteries perplexing mankind. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        You all know how fields all over the world are turning up, apparently 
        overnight, to have patterns cut into them; sometimes very complicated 
        patterns that have been compared to Julia sets, and to even stranger mathematical 
        notions. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Always the questions: are these peculiar and painstaking patterns in fields 
        the work of hoaxers, human beings who, perhaps out of love of inflicting 
        mystification on others have been doing this secretly? Or are they the 
        work of extraterrestrial intelligences, seeking perhaps to tell us something? 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The crop mystery seems to have started in England, but it swiftly began 
        to happen worldwide. The conjectures are endless. People have set up with 
        cameras and sound recording equipment, trying to capture what is happening. 
        The results haven't been convincing. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I decided to look into it myself, and come to my own conclusions. I expected 
        to be believed no more than the others who had looked into the mystery. 
        But at least I would be able to satisfy my own curiosity. I decided to 
        set out my findings in the form of a story, a fictional story, and let 
        the reader make of it what he wished. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I went to Otis, Iowa, for the purpose of witnessing what was happening 
        in a field of corn. The field in question, owned by Mr. Salton Ames, had 
        never been disturbed by such a manifestation, though other farms in the 
        area had. I figured Ames was due.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Farmer Ames put me up at Bed and Breakfast rates. He gave me a comfortable 
        second floor room. My bed had a gingham bedspread, a rocking chair in 
        one corner, a small closet, a bed and a chair. Although this farm was 
        not far from Des Moines, its look and atmosphere put it close to the English 
        Glastonbury, with its ancient, mystical associations. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The English breakfast they served me was pretty good. That first day I 
        wandered around the land, and selected my first site for the coming night. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        That night, around midnight, I left the house and walked slowly down the 
        lane to the cornfields. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It was a dark and misty night, with a hint of rain in it. There was a 
        thin new moon, hanging in the air like a symbol of Islam. It was all in 
        all a spooky sort of a night. When I passed the barns nearby, I could 
        hear the soft movement of cows. Mr. Ames' collie came running up, sniffed 
        me, and went back to his kennel. We had met earlier. Apparently I was 
        OK in his view.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I went down the lane, and came out on one side of the field. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I stood very still for a while and listened. For a while I could hear 
        nothing but the soft voice of the wind. Then, after a while, I heard someone 
        or something moving around. I heard the corn rustling. I knew I was going 
        to find something. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Very quietly I entered the field, walking down one of the rows toward 
        the middle. For a while I could see nothing but corn on all sides of me. 
        And then, suddenly, I saw someone moving through the rows of corn. Careless 
        of my own safety, I hurried to catch up with him. In a rush I came on 
        him, coming up behind him.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        are you doing?" I asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He straightened and turned. He was very tall and skinny, and he was wearing 
        what looked like shiny nylon clothing. His face had the usual number of 
        noses, eyes and mouth, but it wasn't a human face.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        am bending down these stalks," he said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I watched. He walked slowly forward down the row, waving his hand at the 
        corn, his fingers set in a particular way. The corn bent. His hand gestures 
        cut a wide swath through the field. He didn't actually touch the corn.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The first question had been easy. The second one required some thought. 
        Finally I asked, "What are you doing this for?" </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        was assigned to it."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He continued moving. I had a feeling this field was almost complete. I 
        was sure he would vanish on me suddenly, leaving me with a story, but 
        not the story I had come for. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Hey, 
        look," I said, "I'd like to get some answers to this thing. Why are you 
        or your people doing this? Why do you keep your activities secret? And 
        what makes this time different from other times?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He straightened and looked at me. "Why not ask, instead, why I should 
        answer any of your questions? Why not ask why I have allowed you to find 
        me? Why not ask what I want you to know rather than insisting on what 
        you want to know?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'd 
        like to know that very much," I said. "Why are you talking to me?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Every 
        once in a while," he said, "we decide it's time for us to talk to someone 
        on the planet where we're doing this sort of thing. We tell some simple 
        home truths to someone, in the sure knowledge that they won't be believed 
        when they tell it to others of their kind. But at least some things will 
        have been stated. If no one else, at least the person we talk to will 
        know. Something. Not that he can be certain of his knowledge. It doesn't 
        work that way. Deceit and truth are thin alternating layers. Furthermore, 
        the purpose of things is never simple, plain, obvious, and unequivocal. 
        That's not how it works. A while back I talked with one of your fellow 
        humans. His name was Heraclitus. He said, 'You could not step twice into 
        the same river; for other waters are ever flowing on to you.' Don't take 
        intentions for truth."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"But 
        why are you doing this?" I asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Maybe 
        this whole thing was for the purpose of supplying you with a story. Maybe 
        the reason for that story is no business of yours. Your purpose is to 
        write the story. And keep some food in your stomach."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They'll 
        never believe me. How can I expect anyone to believe that I met an alien 
        who quoted Heraclitus?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Whether 
        people believe you or not is not your concern. Truth is not your necessity."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Then 
        what is?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Your 
        concern is trying to find out what is your concern. Your job is not even 
        to find it, it is to keep on searching. It is not even that. It is to 
        keep on, to continue."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Until 
        I'm dead?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Who 
        ever said that death is the end of searching?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He moved on in the field. I followed.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He said, "The great process can do anything. It is not bound by rules 
        of reason. It is not tied to human ideas of how things ought to be. I 
        appear before you in this form. But who is to say this is my true form, 
        or that what I do is my true work?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I had no answer for that. After a while he said, "No truth holds for all 
        circumstances. Nothing explains the peculiarity of life, its apparent 
        determination not to be bound by human reason. The world is not only stranger 
        than you think it is, it is even stranger than you can imagine." </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I looked up Heraclitus when I got home. He said a number of good things. 
        Among them, "Most men do not understand such things as they are wont to 
        meet with; nor by learning do they come to know them, though they think 
        they do."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        And he said, "The Lord at Delphi neither speaks nor conceals, but gives 
        a sign."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He made other good utterances. Check them out for yourself. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        As for me, I have done what it was given me to do. I have written this 
        story, the truth of which I neither affirm nor deny.</font></p>
