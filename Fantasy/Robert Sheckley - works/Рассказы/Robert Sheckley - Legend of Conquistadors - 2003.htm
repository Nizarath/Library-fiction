  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>EARTH CB122XA
  IS ONE OF the alternate Earths spilling out of the matrix of quantum
  mechanical points of possibility that make up this part of the multiverse.
  They do things differently here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Earth
  CB122XA, or &quot;Earth,&quot; as the locals called it, was a quiet place. A
  single king ruled the entire planet. It had its cyclones, floods, forest
  fires, and its plagues and epidemics, just like most of the other Earths. But
  these came in moderation, especially when compared with elsewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>And, just as
  their people and planets and conditions of Earth came out of the cosmic foam,
  so did their gods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>This Earth
  had its own god, generated out of the endless quantum-mechanical
  possibilities. The locals called him &quot;God.&quot; He didn't involve
  himself in the day-to-day workings of the planet or its people. He preferred
  not to work miracles, considering them a cheap effect. This god liked to see
  his people work out things for themselves. But sometimes, when an important
  point was at issue, or when the life of the entire planet hung in the
  balance, he had been known to give a hint or two.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>This Earth,
  like all the others, was prone to accidents. Accidents often have
  forewarnings, but this one had none, unless you count the two spaceships that
  appeared seemingly from out of nowhere, circled the planet as though they
  were doing a survey, and then vanished again into space. This Earth, although
  it was a fairly advanced technological civilization, had no spaceships to
  send up to find out what the strangers wanted. There was some speculation as
  to why they had not responded to Earth's signals, but not much, because only
  a few people had seen them, and their accounts were not generally believed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>All too soon,
  the ships were back, and they led a fleet of spaceships into the skies of
  Earth. These ships were large and fully armed, and the people of Earth did
  not try to oppose them, but waited to see what they would do. To wait was
  also the decision of Drax, the king of Earth at that time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The
  spaceships took up position above Earth's capital city, which was a place of
  architectural merit with many green spaces. At last a single huge ship came
  down and landed on the lawn of the king's palace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Drax said to
  his court officials, &quot;I guess I'd better see what they want.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>He walked out
  alone to the ship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>After a while
  a port in the spaceship opened. A group of men marched out. They were tall,
  broad, ferocious-looking men, wearing battle armor. After them came a single
  man, larger than the others, dressed in golden armor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>He was taller
  than his guards by half a head, and proportionately broader. He carried his
  massive golden armor lightly. He wore metal belts from which hung an
  assortment of weapons, each more terrifying-looking than the one before. In
  one hand he carried a mace with a massy head, around which were mounted
  razor-sharp blades.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>King Drax
  walked up to him and bowed. The golden warrior inclined his head slightly.
  They sized one another up for a moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>At last the
  alien leader spoke. &quot;I am Eduardo. I am the king of this
  several-million-man army that I have brought to your planet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;And I
  am Drax,&quot; Drax said. &quot;I am the king of this planet we call Earth. I
  welcome you. I am amazed to hear you speak our language.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Universal
  translating machinery is one of the few things we have retained from our
  planet's old science. It enables us to give orders to our subject people
  without having to sully our mouths with their debased languages.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;It's
  obviously a useful accomplishment,&quot; Drax said. &quot;Have you many
  subject people?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Every
  race we have encountered is now subject to us. Except for the few who
  preferred to die to the last man.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Our god
  would not approve of that,&quot; said Drax. &quot;He is not in favor of war.
  He advises us to go on living by any means possible, and at any price.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;He
  sounds like a wise god. Let's get down to business. How do you feel about
  fighting me here and now in single combat for the whole works?&quot; His
  gesture seemed to encompass the entire Earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Drax looked
  at the armed man more than twice his size and smiled. &quot;I'd rather
  not,&quot; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Eduardo
  nodded as if he had anticipated that answer. &quot;Then what about if my army
  fights yours?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;We
  haven't fought a war in over a thousand years,&quot; said Drax. &quot;I don't
  think we'd make a very good showing. Have you another alternative?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Eduardo
  looked him up and down and said, &quot;If you think being unarmed and
  insignificant is going to keep me from killing you, you are mistaken.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Why
  should there be any killing at all?&quot; asked Drax.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;It's
  usual,&quot; Eduardo said, &quot;when one king wants to take over the
  territory of another king.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Do you
  really want to be king of this planet so badly that you'd kill for it? Don't
  bother. The planet's yours.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;This is
  anticlimactic,&quot; said Eduardo. &quot;We're accustomed to at least token
  resistance.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;You
  won't find it here,&quot; Drax said. &quot;You're going to rule this planet
  no matter what I say or do. So take it, it's yours.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;All
  right,&quot; Eduardo said. He had seen total capitulation before. &quot;The
  first thing I'll need is a palace. I have to change my armor, issue some
  orders, put up my guard, and get some lunch.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;My
  palace is yours,&quot; Drax said. &quot;I'll move into a hotel in town.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;You're
  pretty cool about all this,&quot; Eduardo said. &quot;I've got a notion to
  kill you right here and now, and rid myself of your deviousness.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;You'll
  do as you wish,&quot; Drax said. &quot;But I assure you, I'm not devious. My
  god tells me the new king must be served. I obey. I would be useful to you in
  getting your orders transmitted to my people and obeyed properly.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;My dear
  fellow, why should I trust you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Because
  I will always be under your eyes and in your hands. If I displease you, you
  can kill me out of hand at any moment.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;That's
  true,&quot; Eduardo said. &quot;Okay. I'll need to go to my palace and get
  out a few orders.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;My
  palace is your palace,&quot; Drax said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>King Eduardo
  had a lot of work to do. He got all his soldiers places to live. This took
  several days. After those chores were done, Eduardo called for Drax and said,
  &quot;Okay, now what?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Your
  majesty has been working very hard,&quot; Drax said. &quot;Might it not be
  time for a little entertainment?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;You
  know, Drax, I've never met anyone like you. Other kings, when I come to take
  over their planet, fight me to their last man. That's noble. I applaud noble
  men like that. But what do you do? You turn over everything to me without a
  fight. Why are you doing this, Drax?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;This is
  what my god has instructed me to do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Must be
  quite a god, to advise you to give in without a struggle, and to hand over
  what you are asked for.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Our god
  has served us well,&quot; Drax said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Well, I
  think it's time we got some girls in here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;As you
  wish,&quot; Drax said. &quot;They'll start arriving by tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;I'll
  want all the finest looking women in the kingdom.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;You'll
  get them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;And let
  your wife be among them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>After a short
  silence, Drax said, &quot;It shall be as you say.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Eduardo
  sneered at him. &quot;You really are a weak son of a bitch!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;What
  would you do if I said you couldn't have her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Kill
  you and take her anyway.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Take
  her anyway, but don't kill me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;So you
  can live to fight another day?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;So I
  can live.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;And I
  believe you have two nubile daughters, too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;That is
  correct.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;I'll
  have them, too. They'll be serving girls at our feasts.&quot; Drax turned
  pale, but he nodded. &quot;Yours is the power to take what you want.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>AND SO THE
  FEASTS and the merrymaking began among the invaders. Eduardo's troops were
  quartered in every city of any size on the planet. Eduardo decreed month-long
  celebrations, and the most beautiful women were forced to attend. The
  invaders were in a very good mood. They considered this a time of national
  degradation for Drax's people, and this pleased them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Eduardo's
  next decision was to consider the people of Earth a population of
  untouchables -- except that they were very touchable by the overclass. The
  Earth people were ordered to refer to themselves as The Underclass. The
  invaders thought that was very funny, and ignoble in the extreme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Eduardo was
  amazed that Drax could bring himself to accept this. He asked him, &quot;How
  can you bear such an insult?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;My god
  told me it's my job to bear insults. &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The king and
  his people quickly got used to bowing and scraping before Eduardo and his
  warriors. It was a big change but they handled it with little difficulty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The invaders
  tasted the pleasures of the Earth and found them good. They quickly
  accustomed themselves to the soft and delicious foods that the underclass
  prepared so well. They grew used to exquisite women, which the Earth had so
  bounteously. And to the exquisite boys, for those whose tastes ran that way.
  They grew to love the great wines of Earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>And then they
  learned about the great drugs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>This Earth
  was exceptionally well-stocked with drugs. And they were all stored in the
  temples that abounded on every continent, and proliferated in every city.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>In the
  culture of Earth, drugs were used only as gifts to the gods. Consequently
  great quantities of them had piled up in the temple storerooms, neatly
  labeled, wrapped, or bagged or barreled. Ready to go. There was ancient
  hashish that had mellowed and intensified for months, for years. There were
  potent psychedelic mushrooms. There were all of the subtle preparations of
  the opium poppy. There were marijuanas so potent that the mere nimbus of
  their scent was enough to intoxicate a man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Eduardo was
  in a high good old spirit when he asked Drax to visit him again, this time in
  his private chamber, which once had been Drax's private chamber. There was
  the carved green jade vase, the antique red turkey rug, and the yellow damask
  couch on which Drax and his wife had reclined in happier days. But it was too
  painful to think about. Drax put it out of his mind, remembering one of his
  god's more resonant sayings: &quot;How easy it is for bad memories to come
  upon a person unawares. To forget such memories is difficult, but one who is
  assiduous toward his own salvation will acquire the knack, if for no other
  reason than to maintain his present happiness.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Eduardo
  appeared in good spirits; his sallow cheeks were flushed, and a hectic light
  was burning in his dark eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;So,
  leader of the underclass,&quot; Eduardo called out, &quot;you see me in an
  elevated mood. Life is good, my dear ex-king.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;I
  agree, and my god agrees, too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;I think
  I know what you're trying to do, you sly dog. You expect me and my men to
  besot ourselves with your drugs, then you will rise up in rebellion against
  us, and cut all our throats.&quot; Here Eduardo laughed very loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;We
  considered it, of course,&quot; Drax said. &quot;But rejected the idea
  immediately. It would never have worked. There are millions of you invaders
  on our planet. If we killed you all, we would pollute our Earth with your
  bodies. Our god would never have stood for it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;So what
  would he have done, this god of yours?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;If we
  polluted his Earth? He would have slain us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;So how
  come he doesn't kill us invaders, who conquered his people and robbed his
  temples?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;I am
  not privy to my god's thoughts, much less his decisions. But since he is a
  thorough sort of deity, he doubtless has plans for you invaders.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;And
  what would they be?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;I
  haven't the slightest idea.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>It was a
  short interview, and apparently unsatisfactory to Eduardo, who waved Drax
  away. The conqueror remained sitting, his chin upon his hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>A few weeks
  later, Eduardo again called for Drax. &quot;I know your plan! It is the
  drugs, isn't it? You thought we would become stupid and careless with them.
  But such is not the case. I am smarter than ever, and my men are doing
  fine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;I had
  no such thought,&quot; Drax said. &quot;I have always believed the supposed
  drawbacks of drugs are greatly exaggerated.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;But you
  do not use them yourself?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Our god
  forbids them to us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;And
  when did that begin?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;The
  taboo began the day your ships appeared in our sky.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Interesting
  .... Well, just as well. The stuff's too good for the underclass.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Drax bowed
  his head in the servile manner he was growing accustomed to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;But the
  reason I asked to see you, my men have been reporting that their local
  temples are almost empty of drugs.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Not
  even the greatest pile is inexhaustible.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;We want
  you and your people to give us more.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;There
  is no more.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;Then
  have your people get out there and grow some.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;We
  tried that, to no avail. No narcotic plant has grown on our planet since your
  arrival.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;And you
  attribute this to your god?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;I
  suspect it's his way of doing things.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;People
  like me and my men are not going to be conquered by a lack of
  narcotics!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Drax cringed
  and nodded. Eduardo remained sitting on the couch, his eyes fixed on
  nothingness. Drax noticed that Eduardo's hands were trembling slightly.
  Seeing that it was an opportune moment, Drax retired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Nothing
  changed, life went on, but suddenly, everything changed. Earth historians
  have theorized that the conquerors had been buoyed up by their own exploits,
  and by the drugs that made them feel good, better, best. Suddenly all that
  was no more, and now there was an almost palpable gloom hanging over the
  invaders. The Earth and its peoples lived on quietly under their
  overlordship. Grain, vegetables, animals, fish, all flourished. All plants
  grew, except for the narcotic-producing ones. Life was quiet, and very tame.
  There were no new lands to conquer. Not on this planet at any rate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>And so, very
  suddenly, in one of those vagaries that are the bewilderment of learned men
  everywhere, the marauders voted en masse to pack up and move on to the next
  world, fresh glory, more conquests, and the next drug. And Eduardo, who was
  as good a politician as he was a warrior, had no choice but to follow the
  people's whim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Drax was
  there when Eduardo walked to his spaceship, the last to take to the skies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>At the
  gangplank, Drax said, &quot;Pleasant voyage, king, and great deeds ahead of
  you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Eduardo
  looked sour. He said to Drax, &quot;I don't know what you or your god did,
  but you tricked us. I'm sure of it. I still don't know why all my men want to
  leave this place. It's something you did. I really ought to kill you before I
  go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>But Drax had
  an answer. He said, &quot;If you did that, who would see to raising your
  statue, building your temple, and clearing the sacred grounds? Who else but I
  would prepare things so my people could worship you as a god?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;I
  hadn't thought of that,&quot; Eduardo said. He looked a little more cheerful.
  &quot;I am a god. I fought your god and won. Put that on the statue!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>&quot;The one
  who wins is the one who sets the rules. Our god says, 'He who laughs last
  laughs best.' Have a nice new conquest, Eduardo. But remember, while you were
  here on Earth, you merely occupied territory for a while. That's not the same
  as winning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
