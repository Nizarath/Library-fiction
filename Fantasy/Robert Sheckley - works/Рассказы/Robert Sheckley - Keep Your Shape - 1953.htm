the Pilot slowed the ship almost to a stand­still, and peered anxiously at the
green planet below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Even without instruments, there
was no mistaking it. Third from its sun, it was the only planet in this system
capable of sustaining life. Peacefully it swam beneath its gauze of clouds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It looked very innocent. And yet,
twenty previous Grom expeditions had set out to prepare this planet for
invasion—and vanished utterly, without a word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid hesitated only a moment,
before starting irrevocably down. There was no point in hovering and worrying.
He and his two crewmen were as ready now as they would ever be. Their com­pact
Displacers were stored in body pouches, inactive but ready.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid wanted to say something to his
crew, but wasn't sure how to put it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The crew waited. Ilg the Ra­dioman
had sent the final mes­sage to the Grom planet. Ger the Detector read sixteen
dials at once, and reported, &quot;No sign of alien activity.&quot; His body
sur­faces flowed carelessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>N</span></b>OTICING
the flow, Pid knew what to say to his crew. Ever since they had left Grom,
shape-discipline had been disgustingly lax. The Invasion Chief had warned him;
but still, he had to do something about it. It was his duty, since lower castes
such as Radiomen and Detectors were notoriously prone to Shapeless­ness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A lot of hopes are resting
on this expedition,&quot; he began slowly. &quot;We're a long way from home
now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ger the Detector nodded. Ilg the
Radioman flowed out of his prescribed shape and molded himself comfortably to a
wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;However,&quot; Pid said
sternly, &quot;distance is no excuse for promiscuous Shapelessness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ilg flowed hastily back into
proper Radioman's shape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Exotic forms will undoubt­edly
be called for,&quot; Pid went on. &quot;And for that we have a special
dispensation. But remember—any shape not assumed strictly in the line of duty
is a foul, lawless device of The Shapeless One!&quot; Ger's body surfaces abruptly
stopped flowing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's all,&quot; Pid said,
and flowed into his controls. The ship started down, so smoothly co­ordinated
that Pid felt a glow of pride.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They were good workers, he
decided. He just couldn't expect them to be as shape-conscious as a high-caste
Pilot. Even the Invasion Chief had told him that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Pid,&quot; the Invasion
Chief had said at their last interview, &quot;we need this planet
desperately.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Pid had
said, stand­ing at full attention, never quivering from Optimum Pilot's Shape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;One of you,&quot; the Chief
said heavily, &quot;must get, through and set up a Displacer near an atomic
power source. The army will be standing by at this end, ready to step
through.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We'll do it, sir,&quot; Pid
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;This expedition has to suc­ceed,&quot;
the Chief said, and his features blurred momentarily from sheer fatigue.
&quot;In strictest confidence, there's considerable unrest on Grom. The Miner
caste is on strike, for instance. They want a new digging shape. Say the old
one is inefficient.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid looked properly indignant. The
Mining Shape had been set down by the Ancients fifty thou­sand years ago,
together with the rest of the basic shapes. And now these upstarts wanted to
change it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's not all,&quot; the
Chief told him. We've uncovered a new Cult of Shapelessness. Picked up almost
eight thousand Grom, and I don't know how many more we missed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid knew that Shapelessness was a
lure of The Shapeless One, the greatest evil that the Grom mind could conceive
of. But why, he wondered, did so many Grom fall for His lures?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>T</span></b>HE
Chief guessed his question. &quot;Pid,&quot; he said, &quot;I sup­pose it's
difficult for you to understand. Do you enjoy Pilot­ing?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Pid said
simply. Enjoy Piloting! It was his entire life! Without a ship, he was noth­ing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not all Grom feel that
way,&quot; the Chief said. &quot;I don't under­stand it either. All my
ancestors have been Invasion Chiefs, back to the beginning of time. So of
Course I want to be an Invasion Chief. It's only natural, as well as lawful.
But the lower castes don't feel that way.&quot; The Chief shook his body sadly.
&quot;I've told you this for a reason. We Grom need more room. This unrest is
caused purely by crowding. All our psychologists say so. An­other planet to
expand into will cure everything. So we're count­ing on you, Pid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Pid said,
with a glow of pride.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Chief rose to end the in­terview.
Then he changed his mind and sat down again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You'll have to watch your
crew,&quot; he said. &quot;They're loyal, no doubt, but low-caste. And you know
the lower castes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid did indeed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ger, your Detector, is sus­pected
of harboring Alterationist tendencies. He was once fined for assuming a
quasi-Hunter shape. Ilg has never had any definite charge brought against him.
But I hear that he remains immobile for suspiciously long periods of time.
Possibly, he fancies him­self a Thinker.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But, sir,&quot; Pid
protested. &quot;If they are even slightly tainted with Alterationism or
Shapeless­ness, why send them on this expedition?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Chief hesitated before an­swering.
&quot;There are plenty of Grom I could trust,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;But
those two have cer­tain qualifies of resourcefulness and imagination that will
be needed on this expedition.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I really don't understand
why those qualities are usually linked with Shapelessness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Pid said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Just watch them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Pid said
again, and saluted, realizing that the interview was at an end. In his body pouch
he felt the dormant Displacer, ready to transform the enemy's power source into
a bridge across space for the Grom hordes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good luck,&quot; the chief
said. &quot;I'm sure you'll need it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>T</span></b>HE
ship dropped silently toward the surface of the enemy planet. Ger the Detector
analyzed the clouds below, and fed data into the Camouflage Unit. The Unit went
to work. Soon the ship looked, to all outward appear­ances, like a cirrus
formation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid allowed the ship to drift
slowly toward the surface of the mystery planet. He was in Op­timum Pilot's
Shape now, the most efficient of the four shapes alloted to the Pilot caste.
Blind, deaf and dumb, an extension of his controls, all his attention was
directed toward matching the ve­locities of the high-flying clouds, staying
among them, becoming a part of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ger remained rigidly in one of the
two shapes alloted to Detectors. He fed data into the Cam­ouflage Unit, and the
descending ship slowly altered into an alto­cumulus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There was no sign of activity from
the enemy planet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ilg located an atomic power
source, and fed the data to Pid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Pilot altered course. He had
reached the lowest level of clouds, barely a mile above the surface of the
planet. Now his ship looked like a fat, fleecy cum­ulus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>And still there was no sign of
alarm. The unknown fate that had overtaken twenty previous expeditions 'still
had not showed itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dusk crept across the face of the
planet as Pid maneuvered near the atomic power installa­tion. He avoided the
surrounding homes and hovered over a clump of woods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Darkness fell, and the green
planet's lone moon was veiled in clouds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>One cloud floated lower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>And landed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Quick, everyone out!&quot;
Pid shouted, detaching himself from the ship's controls. He assumed the Pilot's
Shape best suited for running, and faced out the hatch. Ger and Ilg hurried
after him. They stopped fifty yards from the ship, and waited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Inside the ship a little-used
circuit closed. There was a silent shudder, and the ship began to melt. Plastic
dissolved, metal crumpled. Soon the ship was a great pile of junk, and still
the process went on. Big fragments broke into smaller fragments, and split, and
split again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid felt suddenly helpless, watching
his ship scuttle itself. He was a Pilot, of the Pilot caste. His father had
been a Pilot, and his father before him, stretching back to the hazy past when
the Grom had first constructed ships. He had spent his entire child­hood around
ships, his entire manhood flying them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Now, shipless, he was naked in an
alien world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>I</span></b>N
a few minutes there was only  a mound of dust to show where the ship had been.
The night wind scattered it through the forest. And then there was nothing at
all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They waited. Nothing hap­pened.
The wind sighed and the trees creaked. Squirrels chirped, and birds stirred in
their nests. An acorn fell to the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid heaved a sigh of relief and
sat down. The twenty-first Grom expedition had landed safely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There was nothing to be done until
morning, so Pid began to make plans. They had landed as close to the atomic
power installation as they dared. Now they would have to get closer. Some­how,
one of them had to get very near the reactor room, in order to activate the
Displacer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Difficult. But Pid felt certain of
success. After all, the Grom were strong on ingenuity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Strong on ingenuity, he thought
bitterly, but terribly short of radioactives. That was another reason why this
expedition was so important. There was little radioactive fuel left, on any of
the Grom worlds. Ages ago, the Grom had spent their store of radioactives in
spreading through­out their neighboring worlds, oc­cupying the ones that they
could live on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Now, colonization barely kept up
with the mounting birthrate. New worlds were constantly needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>This particular world, discov­ered
in a scouting expedition, was needed. It suited the Grom perfectly. But it was
too far away. They didn't have enough fuel to mount a conquering space fleet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Luckily, there was another way. A
better way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Over the centuries, the Grom scientists
had developed the Displacer. A triumph of Identity Engineering, the Displacer
allowed mass to be moved instan­taneously between any two linked points.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>One end was set up at Grom's sole
atomic energy plant. The other end had to be placed in promixity to another
atomic pow­er source, and activated. Divert­ed power then flowed through both
ends, was modified, and modified again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Then, through the miracle of
Identity Engineering, the Grom could step through from planet to planet; or
pour through in a great, overwhelming wave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It was quite simple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>But twenty expeditions had failed
to set up the Earth-end Displacer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>What had happened to them was not
known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>For no Grom ship had ever re­turned
to tell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>B</span></b>EFORE
dawn they crept  through the woods, taking on the coloration of the plants
around them. Their Displacers pulsed feebly, sensing the near­ness of atomic
energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A tiny, four-legged creature
darted in front of them. Instantly, Ger grew four legs and a long, streamlined
body and gave chase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ger! Come back here!&quot;
Pid howled at the Detector, throw­ing caution to the winds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ger overtook the animal and
knocked it down. He tried to bite it, but he had neglected to grow teeth. The
animal jumped free, and vanished into the under­brush. Ger thrust out a set of
teeth and bunched his muscles for another leap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ger!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Reluctantly, the Detector turn­ed
away. He loped silently back to Pid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I was hungry,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You were not,&quot; Pid said
stern­ly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Was,&quot; Ger mumbled,
writh­ing with embarrassment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid remembered what the Chief had
told him. Ger certainly did have Hunter tendencies. He would have to watch him
more closely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We'll have no more of
that,&quot; Pid said. &quot;Remember—the lure of Exotic Shapes is not sanc­tioned.
Be content with the shape you were born to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ger nodded, and melted back into
the underbrush. They moved on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At the extreme edge of the woods
they could observe the atomic energy installation. Pid disguised himself as a
clump of shrubbery, and Ger formed him­self into an old log. Ilg, after a
moment's thought, became a young oak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The installation was in the form
of a long, low building, surrounded by a metal fence. There was a gate, and
guards in front of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The first job, Pid thought, was to
get past that gate. He began to consider ways and means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>From the fragmentary reports of
the survey parties, Pid knew that, in some ways, this race of Men were like the
Grom. They had pets, as the Grom did, and homes and children, and a cul­ture.
The inhabitants were skilled mechanically, as were the Grom. But there were
terrific differences, also. The Men were of fixed and immutable form, like
stones or trees. And to compen­sate, their planet boasted a fan­tastic array of
species, types and kinds. This was completely un­like Grom, which had only
eight distinct forms of animal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>And evidently, the Men were
skilled at detecting invaders, Pid thought. He wished he knew how the other
expeditions had failed. It would make his job much easier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>A</span></b>
MAN lurched past them on  two incredibly stiff legs. Rigidity was evident in
his every move. Without looking, he hur­ried past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I know,&quot; Ger said,
after the creature had moved away. &quot;I'll disguise myself as a Man, walk
through the gate to the reactor room, and activate my Dis­placer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You can't speak their lan­guage,&quot;
Pid pointed out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I won't speak at all. I'll
ignore them. Look.&quot; Quickly Ger shaped himself into a Man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's not bad,&quot; Pid
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ger tried a few practice steps,
copying the bumpy walk of the Man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But I'm afraid it won't
work,&quot; Pid said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's perfectly
logical,&quot; Ger pointed out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I know. Therefore the other expeditions
must have tried it. And none of them came back.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There was no arguing that. Ger
flowed back into the shape of a log. &quot;What, then?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Let me think,&quot; Pid
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Another creature lurched past, on
four legs instead of two. Pid recognized it as a Dog, a pet of Man. He watched
it carefully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Dog ambled to the gate, head
down, in no particular hurry. It walked through, un­challenged, and lay down in
the grass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;H'm,&quot; Pid said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They watched. One of the Men
walked past, and touched the Dog on the head. The Dog stuck out its tongue and
rolled over on its side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I can do that,&quot; Ger
said ex­citedly. He started to flow into the shape of a Dog.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, wait,&quot; Pid said.
&quot;We'll spend the rest of the day think­ing it over. This is too important
to rush into.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ger subsided sulkily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Come on, let's move
back,&quot; Pid said. He and Ger started into the woods. Then he remembered
Ilg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ilg?&quot;, he called
softly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ilg!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What? Oh, yes,&quot; an oak
tree said, and melted into a bush. &quot;Sorry. What were you saying?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We're moving back,&quot; Pid
said. &quot;Were you, by any chance, Thinking?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Ilg assured
him. &quot;Just resting.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid let it go at that. There was
too much else to worry about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>T</span></b>HEY
discussed it for the rest of the day, hidden in the deep­est part of the woods.
The only alternatives seemed to be Man or Dog. A Tree couldn't walk past the
gates, since that was not in the nature of trees. Nor could anything else, and
escape notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Going as a Man seemed too risky.
They decided that Ger would sally out in the morning as a Dog.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now get some sleep,&quot;
Pid said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Obediently his two crewmen
flattened out, going immediately Shapeless. But Pid had a more difficult time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Everything looked too easy. Why
wasn't the atomic installa­tion better guarded? Certainly the Men must have
learned some­thing from the expeditions they had captured in the past. Or had
they, killed them without asking any questions?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>You couldn't tell what an alien
would do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Was that open gate a trap?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Wearily he flowed into a com­fortable
position on the lumpy ground. Then he pulled himself together hastily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He had gone Shapeless!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Comfort was not in the line of
duty, he reminded himself, and firmly took a Pilot's Shape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>But a Pilot's Shape wasn't
constructed for sleeping on damp, bumpy ground. Pid spent a rest­less night,
thinking of ships, and wishing he were flying one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He awoke in the morning tired and
ill-tempered. He nudged Ger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Let's get this over
with,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ger flowed gaily to his feet.
&quot;Come on, Ilg,&quot; Pid said angrily, looking around. &quot;Wake
up.&quot; There was no reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ilg!&quot; he called.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Still there was no reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Help me look for him,&quot;
Pid said to Ger. &quot;He must be around here somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Together they tested every bush,
tree, log and shrub in the vicinity. But none of them was Ilg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid began to feel a cold panic run
through him. What could have happened to the Radioman?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps he decided to go
through the gate on his own,&quot; Ilg suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid considered the possibility. It
seemed unlikely. Ilg had never shown much initiative. He had always been
content to follow orders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They waited, But midday came, and
there was still no sign of Ilg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We can't wait any
longer,&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid said, and they started through
the woods. Pid wondered if Ilg had tried to get through the gates on his own. Those
quiet types often concealed a foolhardy streak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>But there was nothing to show that
Ilg had been successful. He would have to assume that the Radioman was dead, or
captured by the Men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>That left two of them to ac­tivate
a Displacer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>And he still didn't know what had
happened to the other expeditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>A</span></b>T
the edge of the woods, Ger  turned himself into a fac­simile of a Dog. Pid
inspected him carefully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A little less tail,&quot; he
said. Ger shortened his tail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;More ears.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ger lengthened his ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now even them up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They became even.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid inspected the finished prod­uct.
As far as he could tell, Ger was perfect, from the tip of his tail to his wet,
black nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good luck,&quot; Pid said.
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Cautiously Ger moved out of the woods, walking in the
lurching style of Dogs and Men. At the gate the guard called to him. Pid held
his breath. Ger walked past the Man, ignoring him. The Man started to walk
over. Ger broke into a run.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid shaped a pair of strong legs
for himself, ready to dash if Ger was caught.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>But the guard turned back to his
gate. Ger stopped running immediately, and strolled quietly toward the main
door of the building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid dissolved his legs with a sigh
of relief ... and then tensed again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The main door was closed! Pid
hoped the Radioman wouldn't try to open it. That was not in the nature of Dogs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>As he watched, another Dog came
running toward Ger. Ger backed away from him. The Dog approached and sniffed.
Ger sniffed back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Then both of them ran around the
building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>That was clever, Pid thought.
There was bound to be a door in the rear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He glanced up at the afternoon
sun. As soon as the Displacer was activated, the Grom armies would begin to
pour through. By the time the Men recovered from the shock, a million or more
Grom troops would be here, weapons and all. With more fol­lowing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The day passed slowly, and nothing
happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Nervously Pid watched the front of
the plant. It shouldn't be taking so long, if Ger were suc­cessful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Late into the night he waited. Men
walked in and out of the installation, and Dogs barked around the gates. But
Ger did not appear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ger had failed. Ilg was gone. Only
he was left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>And still he didn't know what had
happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>B</span></b>Y
morning, Pid was in com­plete despair. He knew that the twenty-first Grom
expedition to this planet was near the point of complete failure. Now it was
all up to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He saw that workers were ar­riving
in great number, rushing through the gates. He decided to take advantage of the
apparent confusion, and started to shape himself into a Man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A Dog walked past the woods where
he was hiding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hello,&quot; the Dog said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It was Ger!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What happened?&quot; Pid
asked, with a sigh of relief. &quot;Why were you so long? Couldn't you get
in?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't know,” Ger said, wag­ging
his tail. &quot;I didn't try.&quot; Pid was speechless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I went hunting,&quot; Ger
said complacently. &quot;This form is ideal for Hunting, you know. I went out
the rear gate with another Dog.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But the expedition — your
duty —&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I changed my mind,&quot; Ger
told him. &quot;You know, Pilot, I never wanted to be a Detector.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But you were born a Detec­tor!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's true,&quot; Ger said.
&quot;But it doesn't help. I always wanted to be a Hunter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid shook his entire body in
annoyance. &quot;You can't,&quot; he said, very slowly, as one would explain to
a Gromling. &quot;The Hunter shape is forbidden to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not here it isn't,&quot; Ger
said, still wagging his tail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Let's have no more of
this,&quot; Pid said angrily. &quot;Get into that installation and set up your
Dis­placer. I'll try to overlook this heresy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No,&quot; Ger said. &quot;I
don't want the Grom here. They'd ruin it for the rest of us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;He's right,&quot; a nearby
oak tree said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;lig!&quot; Pid gasped.
&quot;Where are you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>B</span></b>RANCHES
stirred. &quot;I'm right here,&quot; Ilg said. &quot;I've been Thinking.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But—your caste—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Pilot,&quot; Ger said sadly,
&quot;why don't you wake up? Most of the people on Grom are miserable. Only
custom makes us take the caste-shape of our ancestors.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Pilot,&quot; Ilg said,
&quot;all Grom are born Shapeless!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And being born Shapeless,
all Grom should have Freedom of Shape,&quot; Ger said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Exactly,&quot; Jig said.
&quot;But he'll never understand. Now excuse me. I want to Think.&quot; And the
oak tree was silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid laughed humorlessly. &quot;The
Men will kill you off,&quot; he said. &quot;Just as they killed off all the
other expeditions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No one from Groin has been
killed,&quot; Ger told him. &quot;The other expeditions are right here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Alive?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Certainly. The Men don't
even know we exist. That Dog I was Hunting with is a Grom from the twelfth
expedition. There are hundreds of us here, Pilot. We like it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid tried to absorb it all. He had
always known that the lower castes were lax in caste-conscious­ness. But this
was preposterous!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>This planet's secret menace was
—freedom!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Join us, Pilot,&quot; Ger
said. &quot;We've got a paradise here. Do you know how many species there are
on this planet? An uncount­able number! There's a shape to suit every
need!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid ignored them. Traitors!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He'd do the job all by himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>So Men were unaware of the presence
of the Grom. Getting near the reactor might not be so difficult after all. The
others had failed in their duty because they were of the lower castes, weak and
irresponsible. Even the Pilots among them must have been secretly sympathetic
to the Cult of Shapelessness the Chief had mentioned, or the alien planet could
never have swayed them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>What shape to assume for his
attempt?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid considered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A Dog might be best. Evidently
Dogs could wander pretty much where they wished. If something went wrong, Pid could
change his shape to meet the occasion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The Supreme Council will
take care of all of you,&quot; he snarled, and shaped himself into a small
brown Dog. &quot;I'm going to set up the Displacer myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He studied himself for a mo­ment,
bared his teeth at Ger, and loped toward the gate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>H</span></b>E
loped for about ten feet and  stopped in utter horror. The smells rushed at him
from all directions. Smells in a pro­fusion and variety he had never dreamed
existed. Smells that were harsh, sweet, sharp, heavy, mysterious, overpowering.
Smells that terrified. Alien and repulsive and inescapable, the odors of Earth
struck him like a blow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He curled his lips and held his
breath. He ran on for a few steps, and had to breathe again. He al­most choked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He tried to remold his
Dog-nostrils to be less sensitive. It didn't work. It wouldn't, so long as he
kept the Dog-shape. An attempt to modify his metabolism didn't work either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>All this in the space of two or
three seconds. He was rooted in his tracks, fighting the smells, wondering what
to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Then the noises hit him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They were a constant and stag­gering
roar, through which every tiniest whisper of sound stood out clearly and
distinct. Sounds upon sounds—more noise than he had ever heard before at one
time in his life. The woods behind him had suddenly become a mad­house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Utterly confused, he lost con­trol
and became Shapeless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He half-ran, half-flowed into a
nearby bush. There he re-Shaped, obliterating the offending Dog ears and
nostrils with vicious strokes of his thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Dog-shape was out. Abso­lutely.
Such appalling sharpness of senses might be fine for a Hunter such as Ger—he
prob­ably gloried in them. But an­other moment of such impressions would have
driven Pid the Pilot mad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>What now? He lay in the bush and
thought about it, while gradually his mind threw off the last effects of the
dizzying sensory assault.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He looked at the gate. The Men
standing there evidently hadn't noticed his fiasco. They were looking in
another direction. . . . a Man?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Well, it was worth a try.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>S</span></b>TUDYING
the Men at the  gate, Pid carefully shaped himself into a facsimile—a syn­thesis,
actually, embodying one characteristic of that, another of this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He emerged from the side of the
bush opposite the gate, on his hands and knees. He sniffed the air, noting that
the smells the Man-nostrils picked up weren't unpleasant at all. In fact, some
of them were decidedly otherwise. It had just been the acuity of the
Dog-nostrils, the number of smells they had de­tected and the near-brilliance
with which they had done so, that had shocked him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Also, the sounds weren't half so
devastating. Only relatively close sounds stood out. All else was an undetailed
whispering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Evidently, Pid thought, it had
been a long time since Men had been Hunters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He tested his legs, standing up
and taking a few clumsy steps. Thud of foot on ground. Drag the other leg
forward in a heavy arc. Thud. Rocking from side to side, he marched back and
forth behind the bush. His arms flapped as he sought balance. His head wobbled
on its neck, until he remembered to hold it up. Head up, eyes down, he missed
seeing a small rock. His heel turned on it. He sat down, hard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The ankle hurt. Pid curled his
Man-lips and crawled back into the bush.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Man-shape was too un­speakably
clumsy. It was offen­sive to plod one step at a time. Body held rigidly
upright. Arms wobbling. There had been a de­luge of sense-impressions in the
Dog-shape; there was dull, stiff, half-alive inadequacy to the Man-shape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Besides, it was dangerous, now that
Pid thought it over, as well as distasteful. He couldn't con­trol it properly.
It wouldn't look right. Someone might question him. There was too much about
Men he didn't—couldn't—know. The planting of the Displacer was too important a
thing for him to fumble again. Only luck had kept him from being seen during
the sensory onslaught.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Displacer in his body pouch
pulsed and tugged, urging him to be on his way toward the distant reactor room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Grimly, Pid let out the last
breath he had taken with his Man-lungs, and dissolved the lungs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>What shape to take?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Again he studied the gate, the Men
standing beside it, the build­ing beyond in which was the all-important
reactor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A small shape was needed. A fast
one. An unobtrusive one. He lay and thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The bush rustled above him. A
small brown shape had flut­tered down to light on a twig. It hopped to another
twig, twitter­ing. Then it fluttered off in a flash, and was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>That, Pid thought, was it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>A</span></b>
SPARROW that was not a Sparrow rose from the bush a few moments later. An ob­server
would have seen it circle the bush, diving, hedgehopping, even looping, as if
practicing all manuevers possible to Sparrows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid tensed his shoulder mus­cles,
inclined his wings. He slipped off to the right, ap­proached the bush at what
seemed breakneck speed, though he knew this was only because of his small size.
At the last second he lifted his tail. Not quite quickly enough. He swooped up
and over the top of the bush, but his legs brushed the top leaves, his beak
went down, and he stumbled in air for a few feet back-forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He blinked beady eyes as if at a
challenge. Back toward the bush at a fine clip, again up and over. This time
cleanly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He chose a tree. Zoomed into its
network of branches, wove a web of flight, working his way around and around
the trunk, over and under branches that flashed be­fore him, through crotches
with no more than a feather's-breath to spare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At last he rested on a low branch,
and found himself chirp­ing in delight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The tree extruded a feeler from
the branch he sat on, and touched his wings and tail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Interesting,&quot; said the
tree. &quot;I'll have to try that shape some time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Ilg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Traitor,&quot; hissed Pid,
growing a mouth in his chest to hiss it, and then he did something that caused
Ilg to exclaim in out­rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid flew out of the woods. Over
the underbrush and across the open space toward the gate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>This body would do the trick!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>This body would do anything!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He rose, in a matter of a few
Sparrow heartbeats, to an alti­tude of a hundred feet. From here the gate, the
Men, the build­ing were small, sharp shapes against a green-brown mat. Pid
found that he could see not only with unaccustomed clarity, but with a range of
vision that aston­ished him. To right and to left he could see far into the
hazy blue of the sky, and the higher he rose the farther he could see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He rose higher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Displacer pulsed, remind­ing
him of the job he had to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>H</span></b>E
stiffened his wings and glided, regretfully putting aside his desires to
experiment with this wonderful shape, at least for the present. After he
planted the Displacer, he would go off by himself for a while and do it just a
little more—somewhere where Ilg and Ger would not see him—before the Grom Army
arrived and the invasion began.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He felt a tiny twinge of guilt, as
he circled. It was Evil to want to keep this alien flying shape any longer than
was absolutely necessary to the performance, of his duty. It was a device of
the Shapeless One</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>But what had Ilg said? All Grom
are born Shapeless. It was true. Grom children were amor­phous, until old
enough to be in­structed in the caste-shape of their ancestors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Maybe it wasn't too great a sin to
alter your Shape, then—just once in a long while. After all, one must be fully
aware of the nature of Evil in order to meaningfully reject it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He had fallen lower in circling.
The Displacer pulse had strength­ened. For some reason it irritated him. He
drove higher on strong wings, circled again. Air rushed past him—a smooth,
whispering flow, pierced by his beak, stream­ing invisibly past his sharp eyes,
moving along his body in tiny turbulences that moved his feath­ers against his
skin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It occurred to him—or rather
struck him with considerable force—that he was satisfying a longing of his
Pilot Caste that went far deeper than Piloting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He drove powerfully with his
wings, felt tonus across his back, shot forward and up. He thought of the
controls of his ship. He imagined flowing into them, be­coming part of them, as
he had so often done—and for the first time in his life the thought failed to
excite him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>No machine could compare with
this!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>What he would give to have wings
of his own!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Get from my sight, Shape­less One!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Displacer must be planted,
activated. All Grom depended on him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He eyed the building, far be­low.
He would pass over it. The Displacer would tell him which window to enter—which
window was so near the reactor that he could do his job before the Men even
knew he was about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He started to drop lower, and the
Hawk struck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>I</span></b>T
had been above him. His first inkling of danger was the sharp pain of talons in
his back, and the stunning blow of a beak across his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dazed, he let his back go
Shapeless. His body-substance flowed from the grasp of the tal­ons. He dropped
a dozen feet and resumed Sparrow-shape, hearing an astonished squawk from the
attacker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He banked, and looked up. The Hawk
was eying him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Talons spread again. The sharp
beak gaped. The Hawk swooped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid had to fight as a Bird, nat­urally.
He was four hundred feet above the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>So he became an impossibly deadly
Bird.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He grew to twice the size of the Hawk.
He grew a foot-long beak with a double razor's edge. He grew talons like six
inch scimi­tars. His eyes gleamed a red challenge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Hawk broke flight, squal­ling
in alarm. Frantically, tail down and widespread, it thun­dered its wings and
came to a dead stop six feet from Pid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Looking thoughtfully at Pid, it
allowed itself to plummet. It fell a hundred feet, spread its wings, stretched
its neck and flew off so hastily that its wings became blurs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pid saw no reason to pursue it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Then, after a moment, he did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He glided, keeping the Hawk in
sight, thoughts racing, feeling the newness, the power, the won­der of Freedom
of Shape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Freedom . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He did not want to give it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The bird-shape was wondrous. He
would experiment with it. Later, he might tire of it for a time and assume
another—a crawling or running shape, or even a swimming one. The possi­bilities
for excitement, for adven­ture, for fulfilment and simple sensual pleasure were
endless!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Freedom of Shape was—ob­viously,
now that you thought on it—the Grom birthright. And the caste-system was
artificial—obviously. A device for political and priestly benefit—obviously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Go away, Shapeless One . . . this
does not concern you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He rose to a thousand feet, two
thousand, three. The Displacer's pulse grew feebler and finally vanished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At four thousand feet he re­leased
it and watched it spin downward, vanish into a cloud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Then he set out after the Hawk,
which was now only a dot on the horizon. He would find out how the Hawk had
broken flight as it had—skidded on air—he wanted to do that too! There were so
many things he wanted to learn about flying. In a week, he thought, he should
be able to duplicate all the skill that mill­enia had evolved into Birds. Then
his new life would really begin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He became a torpedo-shape with
huge wings, and sped after the Hawk.</p>

city of the future, and no very distant future, will have no trolley poles or
wires and no horses. All movements will be on rails by silent air motors or by
boneless carriages, equally silent. All pavements will be asphalt. Unlimited
light will be as cheap as unlimited water is today. No coal wilt be delivered
at private homes and no ashes taken from them. With no horses, no coal, and no
ashes, street dirt will be reduced to a minimum. With no factory fires and no
kitchen or furnace fires, the air will be as pure in the city as in the country.
Trees will have a chance. Houses will be warmed and lighted as easily and
cheaply as they are now supplied with water. A city will be a pretty nice place
to live in when the first twenty years of the twentieth century are passed.—<i>The
