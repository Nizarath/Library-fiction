<b>THE ERYX</b><br>
ROBERT SHECKLEY<br>
 <br>
 <br>I WOKE UP AND LOOKED AROUND. EVERYTHING WAS JUST about<br>the same.<br>
 <br>“Hey, Julie,” I said. “You up yet?”<br> <br>Julie didn’t answer. She couldn’t. She was my imagi-nary playmate.<br>
Maybe I was crazy, but at least I knew Julie was someone I’d made up.<br>
 <br>I got out of bed, showered, dressed. It was all the same as it always<br>
was. And yet, I had the feeling something had changed.<br>
 <br>I didn’t know what annoyed me the most about the setup. I had given<br>
up being annoyed. I had one room and a bathroom. Outside of my room<br>was a glassed-in porch. I could walk out on the porch and sun myself. They<br>seemed to have the sun going all day long, every day. I wondered what had<br>happened to the rainy days I’d known back in my youth. Or maybe there<br>were rainy days but I just wasn’t seeing them. I had suspected for a long<br>time that my room and its glassed-in enclosure were inside some other sort<br>of a building, a really big building where they controlled the light and the<br>climate, made it just like they wanted it. Evidently the way they wanted it was<br>with hazy sunlight all day long. I couldn’t see the sun even when I was<br>outside. Just a white sky and light glaring from it. It could come from klieg<br>lights, for all I knew. They didn’t let me see much.<br>
 <br>I had spotted the cameras, however. They were little units, Sonys, I<br>
suspected, and their tiny black matte heads rotated all of the time, keeping<br>me in sight. There were cameras inside my one room, too, up in the<br>corners, behind steel netting that I couldn’t tear away even if I wanted to,<br>which I didn’t, and cameras even in my bathroom. I hated that. During my<br>first days here, I’d screamed at the walls, “Hey, what’s it with you guys, don’t<br>you got any sense of privacy? Can’t a guy even take a dump without you<br>watching?” But nobody ever answered me. No one ever talked to me. I’d<br>been here seventy-three days, I made notches on the plastic table to keep<br>count. But sometimes I forgot, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it turned out to<br>
<hr>
<A name=2></a>be a lot longer than that. They’d allowed me writing materi-als, too, but no<br>computer. Were they afraid of what I might do with a computer? I didn’t<br>have any idea. They gave me reading material, too. Old stuff. <i>Moll<br>Flanders. Idylls of the King. The Iliad </i>and <i>Odyssey. </i>Stuff like that. Good<br>stuff, but not exactly up to date. And they never showed themselves.<br>
 <br>Why was that? I couldn’t figure it out. I didn’t even know what they<br>
looked like. They’d grabbed me back then, seventy-three days ago. Stuff<br>had still been happen-ing back then. I’d been home. I’d received an urgent<br>fax. Office of the President. “We need you urgently.” I’d come. In fact,<br>they’d sent men to bring me to this place. Men who didn’t answer any of my<br>questions. I’d tried to find out. What’s this all about? They’ll tell you more<br>in-side, that’s all they’d told me.<br>
 <br>And then I’d been inside. They’d given me a suite of rooms, told me<br>
to get some rest, there’d be a meeting soon. I’d gone to sleep that first<br>night, and been awakened by sounds of shooting. I’d gone to the door. It<br>was locked. I could hear men shouting, struggling out in the hall. And then<br>there’d been silence. And the silence had gone on and on.<br>
 <br>At first I’d thought I was pretty well off. The others had gotten killed, I<br>
suspected. Those blank-faced men who’d brought me here. All dead, I was<br>sure of it. I was the only one remaining. But what for? What did they want<br>me for?<br>
 <br>I’d heard noises outside my suite of rooms. Sounded like someone<br>
was building something. What they were doing was cutting down my<br>mobility. Reducing my three-room suite to a room, a bathroom, and a<br>glassed-in outside area. Why had they done that? What was it all about?<br>
 <br>The hell of it was, I had a feeling about what it was all about. I thought<br>
I knew. But I didn’t want to admit it to myself.<br>
 <br>The time of the tests had come. That had been a few weeks ago.<br>
They had poked instruments down through the ceiling. Stuff that looked at<br>me, stuff on the end of wires that recorded me. I’d gone a little crazy during<br>that time. I knew they’d gassed me a couple of times. When I came to, I<br>found cuts and injection marks on my body. Bruises. They’d been<br>experimenting with me. Trying to find out something. Using me as a guinea<br>pig. But for what? Just because I’d started the whole mess? That wasn’t<br>fair. They’d no right to do that. It hadn’t been my fault.<br>
 <br>I invented an imaginary playmate after a while. Some-one to talk to.<br>
They must have thought I was crazy. But I needed someone to talk to. I just<br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>couldn’t go on talking in my head all the time.<br>
 <br>“So listen, Julie, the way I figure it, it all began back then when Gomez<br>
and I went out to Alquemar. I don’t think I ever told you about Alquemar, did<br>I?”<br>
 <br>I had, of course. But Julie was always obliging.<br> <br>“No, you never mentioned it. What’s Alquemar?”<br> <br>“It’s this planet. It’s quite some distance from Earth. A long way. But I<br>
went there. Gomez and I. That’s where we found the discovery that<br>changed everything.”<br>
 <br>“What did you find?” Julie asked.<br> <br>“Well, let me bring you back to those faraway days. ...”<br>
 <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>I was hanging out in this bar in Taos when I ran into Gomez over a bowl of<br>hard-boiled eggs. We started to talk, as strangers will on a sleepy morning<br>in a sleepy little town in New Mexico with nothing much to do with the long<br>day ahead but drink a lot of beer and dream a lot of dreams.<br>
 <br>Gomez was a short, barrel-chested guy from Santa Fe. A painter.<br>
He’d come to Taos to sketch tourists, make a few bucks. He’d taken a<br>degree in art history at the Uni-versity of New Mexico. But his interest was in<br>alien artifacts.<br>
 <br>“Is that a fact?” I said. “I’m interested in that stuff myself.”<br>
 <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>You gotta remember how it was back in those days. Exploration of space<br>was brand spanking new. It had begun with the Dykstra Drive, the<br>faster-than-light drive that made space exploration possible. You used the<br>Dyks-tra only between the stars, out in deep space. When you got in close,<br>you used the ion engines for maneuvering. That’s where you burned up the<br>fuel. And fuel cost money.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>So the search was on. For intelligent life. Yes, that was the big one. But that<br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>was on a level above the one I was operating on. Or wanted to be operating<br>on. I wanted to make some money in artifacts. It was a big market<br>Espe-cially in the first ten years or so of the rush to space, when everybody<br>was crazy to own some piece of shit from an alien planet. Put it up on the<br>mantel. “See that doo-hickey? It came from Arcturus V. I’ve got papers to<br>prove it.” Humans are crazy about conversation pieces. The fad ran down<br>after a while, but there was still plenty of de-mand. By the time I got into the<br>racket, collectors had become a whole lot more discriminating. The stuff<br>you brought in had to be of artistic merit, as they phrased it. How do you<br>judge artistic merit? I don’t. That’s why I had Gomez along. If Gomez, with<br>his credentials, said it was good, dealers were apt to believe him.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>I was qualified. I’d pushed ships for NASA for a couple of years, until a<br>difference of opinion with my superior put me out of work. I was looking for<br>a way to get back in. Gomez was a couple of years younger than me, but he<br>had similar ideas.<br>
 <br>Gomez was young, wanted to travel, and he was more than willing to<br>
sell his services cheap for the privilege of going out into deep space. An<br>appraiser is important on a scavenging expedition. You need someone who<br>has an idea of the current market, has some idea what dealers will pay for<br>“genuine alien artifacts.” You also need a guy to prepare and sign the<br>provenance, the statement that gives whatever is known about the origin of<br>the article. Although he was young, Gomez’s reputation in the field was<br>excellent. If Gomez swore it was real alien goods, dealers would know they<br>weren’t buying something faked in a factory in Calcutta or Jersey City.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>That was the scavenging aspect. Of course, the main push was to find the<br>folks who had left that stuff. But those guys just didn’t seem to be around<br>anymore. What happened to the vanished civilizations of the galaxy? That<br>was a question that interested a lot of people. You know how much interest<br>there is on Earth in vanished peoples. You don’t, Julie? Take my word for it.<br>Folks find it romantic.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>Although the first buying spree was over, alien artifacts was still a pretty<br>good racket. Even though there were a lot of people out there working it,<br>the ruins scattered around the galaxy were a long way from being picked<br>over. Just too many planets, too many ruins. And too few spaceships.<br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>So Gomez and I talked about this stuff, there in the hazy cigarette smoke<br>and beer smell, among Indians and tourists and farmers. After a while<br>Gomez said, “You know, Dalton, we could make a good team. You’re a<br>spaceship jockey, and I’ve got the art-appraisal skills we’d need.”<br>
 <br>“I agree,” I told him. “But we lack just one thing. A ship. And some<br>
backers.”<br>
 <br>Investing in spaceships to go scavengering in was a popular<br>
speculation in those days. You’d be surprised how many people were able<br>to get their hands on a spaceship. For a while, every country in the world<br>felt it needed at least one spaceship for national prestige. There was a time<br>when there were more working ships than qualified men to ran them. I had<br>the know-how, and I had the right attitude. I mean, I was no pure-science<br>freak. I liked to make a profit.<br>
 <br>“I could maybe help us find something,” Gomez said. “I know some<br>
people, did some art appraising for them last year. They were pleased with<br>the results. I heard them talking about going into deep-space exploration.”<br>
 <br>“Sounds like a natural to me,” I said. “Fifty-fifty between us, OK?<br>
Where do we see these guys?”<br>
 <br>“Let me make a phone call,” Gomez said.<br> <br>He went away, came back in a few minutes.<br> <br>“I talked with Mr. Rahman in Houston. He’s interested. We’ve got a<br>
meeting with him day after tomorrow.”<br>
 <br>“Rahman? What kind of name is that? Arab?”<br> <br>“He’s Indonesian.”<br>
 <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>Rahman had a suite at the Star of Texas. He was in town doing an oil deal<br>with some Texas wildcatters. He was a little skinny guy, colored a medium<br>brown, a shade darker than Gomez. Little mustache. He didn’t wear no<br>native clothes. Italian silk suit, must have cost thousands. He was a<br>Moslem, but there was no silly stuff about not drinking alcohol. He poured<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>us some Jim Beam Reserve and had one himself.<br>
 <br>We talked, casual stuff for a while, and I got the definite impression<br>
that this Rahman and his people had a lot of money they didn’t really know<br>what to do with. A little birdie told me it might have been drug money. Not<br>that I thought Rahman was a dealer. But he was an advance man for an<br>Indonesian investment group, and their cash flow seemed a little heavy to<br>be accounted for entirely from oil. But what do I know? Just an impression,<br>and his willingness to do business with Gomez and me, a couple of<br>unknowns.<br>
 <br>First he went over my credentials. They were pretty good if I do say<br>
so myself. I’d worked ships for NASA for a couple of years until I got into a<br>dispute with my superior and found myself out of a job. After that I’d gotten<br>work for a private company pushing a supply ship between Earth and the<br>L-5 colony. That went fine until L-5 went bust and I was out of work again. I<br>had the papers and newspaper clippings to document everything.<br>
 <br>“Your credentials look good to me, Mr. Dalton,” Rah-man said. “I<br>
already know Mr. Gomez’s work. We’d be willing to make an arrangement<br>with you. Salary plus ten percent of the profits on whatever you find, to be<br>split between you and Mr. Gomez. What do you think?”<br>
 <br>“I’d like it a lot better if you could make that ten percent for each of us.<br>
It’s not a deal-breaker, but it would be nice.”<br>
 <br>Rahman thought for a while. I guess he was thinking that this from his<br>
point of view was mainly a way to sock away some hot money. Profit was<br>secondary. Rahman’s group was making theirs right here on Earth.<br>
 <br>“I suppose we could accommodate you,” Rahman said. “Come to<br>
Djakarta with me and take a look at our ship. If you approve, we’ll draw up<br>papers. How soon can you begin?”<br>
 <br>“We’ve started right now,” I said, looking at Gomez. He nodded.<br> <br>The <i>City of Djakarta </i>was a pretty good ship. German manufacture,<br>
Indonesian ownership. The Krauts made pretty good ships back in those<br>days. We signed a contract, loaded supplies, I made a few phone calls,<br>picked up some information, and in a month we were on our way.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>The first planet we checked out, Alquemar IV in Bootes, circled an O-type<br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a>star in the Borodin cluster, which is a dense region of a couple thousand<br>stars, two-thirds of them with planets. I paid a lot for the information. I got it<br>from a technician attached to a British star-mapping expedition. He hadn’t<br>been against earning a little on the side. There are channels where you can<br>pick up that sort of informa-tion. I’m good with a spaceship, but I’m even<br>better at working the channels and making a deal. This info cost a lot, but it<br>looked like it was going to be worth it. My guy said he thought Alquemar IV<br>had ruins, though his group hadn’t gotten close enough to be sure. When<br>Gomez and I got there, we agreed at once that we’d struck paydirt. Now<br>was the time to put down and let Gomez do his thing.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>When I checked it out, I found Alquemar IV had enough oxygen for us, and<br>gravity nine-tenths that of Earth. And so we went down hoping for a big<br>strike, like Lefkowitz had when he discovered the Manupta friezes on Elgin<br>XII, and sold them for a bundle direct to the Museum of Mod-ern Art in New<br>York. In fact, I knew this had to be good, or I was in trouble. I was using up<br>a lot of fuel. It’s costly to maneuver at sublight speeds in the area of<br>planets.<br>
 <br>It was a yellowish-brown planet with some green patches. Those<br>
patches showed where there was water and vegetation. We did an aerial<br>recon of the largest patches, and found a section that looked good enough<br>for us to go to the expense of putting the ship down on the ground. It’s<br>more economical to put the ship in orbit and go back and forth by orbiter,<br>but it also takes more equipment, to say nothing of the cost of an orbiter.<br>We didn’t have one. When something good came up, we wanted the ship<br>right down there with us.<br>
 <br>There were ruins, all right. They were spread out over several<br>
hundred acres, circular ruins in a jungle. They were surrounded by what had<br>once been a wall. The atmosphere checked out OK, no noxious stuff, so<br>we unpacked our dirt bikes and rode into the area. The first couple days<br>were spent just getting a feel of the place.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>It took us almost a week before we hit on an area that looked worth<br>examining closely. It was deep in the jungle, and it appeared to be the<br>remains of a circular building. A temple, maybe. We’d call it that on the<br>report, anyway. We went in slowly, filming everything, because film of these<br>expeditions is worth some money, too. We were looking for just about<br>anything. Household stuff is always good. Furniture, household items, cups,<br>
<hr>
<A name=8></a>bowls, armor, weapons—anything that might look good hanging on a wall or<br>sitting on a table in a museum or some rich guy’s house. Trouble is, it’s<br>almost impossible to find stuff like that. The disappeared aliens don’t leave<br>you much. It’s a mystery. Hell, everything’s a mystery.<br>
 <br>We came across a broken staircase leading down into the ground.<br>
This was a very good sign. In most ruins, you don’t even find this much. I<br>gave Gomez a wink. “This one’s going to make us rich, partner.”<br>
 <br>Gomez shrugged. “Don’t be too sure. Explorers have been<br>
disappointed before.”<br>
 <br>“I got a feeling about this one,” I told him.<br> <br>The steps led down a long ways, and into a big under-ground<br>
chamber. It was a spooky place: low, domed ceil-ing, protruding rocks<br>casting weird shadows. There were some metal objects lying around on the<br>ground. I picked up a couple of them and showed them to Gomez. He<br>shook his head. “That stuff doesn’t look alien enough.”<br>
 <br>That’s a problem in this line of work. People have pretty firm ideas<br>
about what they think alien ought to look like. Something alien ought to look<br>like something you couldn’t find on Earth. Something that nobody ever<br>thought of mak-ing. Something that gave off an air of mystery. And that’s<br>asking a lot of a pot or a chair. Just about everything you found on an alien<br>planet was alien only by definition. But the few pots and cups that had been<br>found could just as easily have been made on Earth. Not even a letter<br>stating where and when the object had been found would give them any<br>real value. The stuff people paid cash money for had to look alien, not just<br>be alien. It had to fit people’s idea of alien. It presented a challenge.<br>
 <br>There was another chamber after the first one. We went into it, our<br>
floodlights sweeping the place with white light. And it was there we saw it.<br>The object that came to be called the Eryx.<br>
 <br>Now listen, Julie, don’t carry this beautiful but dumb act too far.<br>
Everyone on Earth has heard of the Eryx. You’ve got to have heard of it.<br>Maybe in your circle they called it the alien gizmo. Does that ring a bell?<br>
 <br>It rested on a piece of shiny cloth with marks on it. It was sitting on a<br>
low stone pillar with fluted sides. The object seemed to be shiny metal,<br>though no one has ever discovered what it’s made of. It was about the size<br>of a child’s head. It was carved or cast or worked into shapes I’d never<br>seen before, nor had Gomez. The shapes looked random and chaotic at<br>
<hr>
<A name=9></a>first, but when you sat down and studied them, you could see there was a<br>logic at work there.<br>
 <br>The thing glowed. It glistened. Its shapes and angles seemed to be<br>
curved. But it was difficult to say whether they were convex curves or<br>concave ones. Sometimes it looked like one thing, sometimes another. Nor<br>were all the planes identical. Optical effect, a triumph of the eye. Staring at<br>it was like staring into a cubistic candle whose surfaces and facets were<br>unfamiliar but fascinating, which held the eye, drawing it ever deeper.<br>
 <br>“Man, we’ve got it,” Gomez said. “The big one. This has to be the art<br>
find of the century. And the hell of it is, I can’t tell if it was manufactured or<br>grown, or if it’s a natural form.”<br>
 <br>We didn’t speak for a long time, Gomez and me. But we were thinking<br>
the same thoughts. Or at least I think we were. I was thinking, this is it, the<br>big one, the pot at the end of the rainbow. This is the mother of all alien<br>objects. It doesn’t look like anything anyone has ever seen before, and it’s<br>small enough to fit on the mantel of the richest man in the world. It was the<br>ultimate desirable object. You couldn’t do better than that.<br>
 <br>After gawking at it for a while, we went back to the ship and brought<br>
back equipment for carrying it to the ship. We didn’t touch it with our hands.<br>We used a neu-tral-surface manipulator to lift it and place it, ever so gently,<br>into a padded container. We didn’t know if this thing was fragile or what. We<br>just knew it was important not to break our egg on the way to market.<br>Gomez even made a joke about it.<br>
 <br>“We’re putting all our egg into one basket,” he said, as we got it back<br>
to the ship and stowed it away in the cargo hold. It was going to be<br>Gomez’s last joke for a while.<br>
 <br>We decided to spend no more time on Alquemar. This one find was<br>
going to make our fortunes, and we decided to get right onto it. I cranked<br>up the ship’s engine and that’s where we had our first indication that things<br>weren’t going to be quite as simple as we’d expected.<br>
 <br>The engine wouldn’t start.<br> <br>Now, Julie, take my word for it, when your spaceship engine won’t turn<br>
over, it’s not a simple matter of chang-ing spark plugs or adding gas. These<br>engines aren’t meant to be fooled with by the likes of me or Gomez. It<br>takes a full maintenance crew working in a factory facility to do anything with<br>one of those things. All we could do was run the diagnostics. All they told<br>
<hr>
<A name=10></a>us was that the thing wasn’t working. We knew that ourselves. What we<br>didn’t know was why, or what to do about it.<br>
 <br>We didn’t give up as easily as that. I went through the whole drill.<br>
Reran the diagnostics. Ran diagnostics on the diagnostics. Tried to get a<br>signal to the home office back on Earth. That was futile, of course. Modern<br>spaceship travel leaves you in the curious position of being able to reach a<br>place faster than light can do it, and a hell of a lot faster than any form of<br>signal transmission. It looked like we were stuck. And the hell of it was,<br>there wasn’t anyone who might come out to see what had gone wrong with<br>us. We were like the pioneers trekking across the Rockies to California. Or<br>like Cortes and his conquistador-es slogging across unknown lands in<br>search of Aztec riches. If a conquistador’s horse broke down, Spain didn’t<br>send an expedition out to rescue him. They just wrote him off. And that’s<br>what would happen with us. No one had asked us to come out here. Our<br>Indonesian sponsors didn’t a give damn if we got back or not. Not as long<br>as they kept the insurance paid up.<br>
 <br>We didn’t panic. Gomez and I had always known this was one of the<br>
risks of this deal. We sat around and hoped maybe the engine would come<br>back on line all by itself. It’s been known to happen. We played chess, we<br>read books, we ate our supplies, and at last we decided to take the Eryx out<br>of storage and take a look at it again. If we had to go, at least we could go<br>in what Gomez called an aesthetic manner.<br>
 <br>I guess I haven’t told you why we called it the Eryx. It was because of<br>
what we found on that piece of cloth the thing had been sitting on. That<br>cloth was covered with marks and doodles. We thought it was just a design.<br>But it turned out to be the first bit of alien writing anyone had discovered.<br>And it was the only one until a year or so later. Clayton Ross came across<br>the inscribed rock that they called the Space Age Rosetta Stone during his<br>expedi-tion to Ophiuchus II. One part was in an ancient variation of Sanskrit,<br>the rest in three alien languages, one of which corresponded to the writing<br>on the Eryx cloth. Gomez and I had come up with the first writing ever<br>discovered in an alien language.<br>
 <br>But we didn’t know that at the time. It took experts to point out that<br>
what we had thought was just a decorative pattern was in fact language. As<br>for why we named the gizmo Eryx—follow me on this, Julie. At the top of<br>the cloth, or what we figured was the top, there were four marks larger than<br>the others in what turned out to be the text. We couldn’t read them, of<br>course. But the four largest characters looked like the English letters<br>E-R-Y-X. So we called our gizmo the Eryx. The name caught on.<br>Every-body called it that, right from the start.<br>
<hr>
<A name=11></a> <br>As you’ve doubt surmised, being the clever little lady you are, we<br>
didn’t die on Alquemar. We got off. What happened, you see, is that we<br>brought the Eryx out of the hold and into the main cabin. So we could look<br>at what might be costing us our lives. This put it not only close to us, but<br>also to the engines. When we tried to start up again, something happened.<br>We never did figure out what or why. But suddenly everything was in the<br>green and our engine was working again.<br>
 <br>Coincidence? We thought it might have been. But we weren’t so filled<br>
with the spirit of scientific experimenta-tion that we were ready to move the<br>Eryx back to the hold just to see if the engine died again. That would be<br>carrying the spirit of experimentation too far. We got the hell out of<br>Alquemar while we could. Got back to Earth.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>Rahman met us in the Disneyland Hotel in Jogjakarta. He thought the Eryx<br>was pretty. But you could tell he wasn’t impressed. Or maybe it was<br>because he had a lot of other stuff on his mind. I only learned later that the<br>CIA and local narcotics feds had become very interested in Rahman and<br>his partners. I guess Rahman saw trouble coming. Because he said, “I’m<br>sure we could sell this and realize a fine profit. But I have a better idea. I’ve<br>consulted with my partners. We’re going to give this object to a big<br>American research company, to hold in the public trust, to study for the<br>benefit of all mankind.”<br>
 <br>“That’s very civic-minded of you,” I said. “But why would you want to<br>
do that?”<br>
 <br>“We’d like to stay on the good side of the Americans,” Rahman said.<br>
“It could be useful later.”<br>
 <br>“But you won’t make any money this way.”<br> <br>“Sometimes goodwill is more important than money.”<br> <br>“Not to us it isn’t!”<br> <br>Rahman smiled and muttered something in the local dialect. The local<br>
equivalent of “tough shit,” no doubt.<br>
 <br>I wasn’t quite ready to give up. “But we’d agreed to sell any artifacts<br>
we found and split the profits!”<br>
<hr>
<A name=12></a> <br>“That is not correct,” Rahman said, rather coldly. “If you read your<br>
contract, you’ll see that you participate in the sale of artifacts only if we do in<br>fact decide to sell. But the decision is entirely up to us.”<br>
 <br>He was right about the wording of the contract. But who could have<br>
guessed that they wouldn’t sell?<br>
 <br>I realized the wisdom of Rahman’s move—from his point of<br>
view—about a year later, after the CIA, working with the Indonesian<br>authorities, busted him for the interna-tional dope trafficking. The fix must<br>have been in. He got off with a fine.<br>
 <br>Gomez and I followed orders and brought the Eryx to Microsoft-IBM<br>
in Seattle, the biggest private research fa-cility in the States. We told them<br>about the engine, said that if our inference was correct, this thing had<br>indeed influenced its operation.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>Well, at Microsoft-IBM, the guys in white coats ran tests from here to hell<br>and back on the thing, and the more they saw the more excited they got,<br>and they called in bigshot scientists from universities all around the world,<br>and Microsoft-IBM was glad to pay for it because it gave them publicity like<br>you couldn’t believe, and besides, soon enough the government began<br>funding it.<br>
 <br>Gomez and I were superfluous. After taking our state-ment, nobody<br>
needed anything else from us. The Indone-sian group went out of the<br>spaceship business; it was save your ass time, and they were going to be<br>busy for a long time. They gave us a pretty good bonus, however. I was<br>already negotiating for new backers and a new ship and a better deal, and<br>between us we had just enough money to swing it.<br>
 <br>And then Gomez got himself killed in a traffic accident in Gallup, New<br>
Mexico, of all places, and his family were his heirs and I was in legal stuff<br>up to the giggie. The court never believed that Gomez had verbally deeded<br>his share to me, and it cost me a fortune in lawyers to finally not be able to<br>prove it and have half of what was supposed to be our seed money go to<br>some uncle Gomez had never even met down in Oaxaca, Mexico.<br>
 <br>So I was on my own, and in what they call straitened circumstances. I<br>
managed to make a deal with some South African diamond people and<br>took a new ship, the <i>Witwatersrand, </i>back to Alquemar to look for more<br>
<hr>
<A name=13></a>stuff. That was when Stebbins, the company man the South Africans had<br>forced on me, got killed in a cave collapse, and I got blamed. It was really<br>unfair. I’d been sitting in the ship playing solitaire when he went out without<br>authorization to the site, trying to make something on the side for him-self, I<br>doubt not. But they trumped up a case of negligence against me in<br>Johannesburg and I lost my license.<br>
 <br>So I came up empty on that one and suddenly people didn’t want to<br>
hire me anymore for anything. So what with one thing and another I wasn’t<br>around when the white coats were making some of their most important<br>discover-ies about the Eryx. During that period I was doing six months in<br>Lunaville on a trumped-up charge of embezzle-ment. So I had my hands<br>full with my own problems when Guillot at the Sorbonne, working with<br>Clayton Ross’s New Rosetta stone, came up with a translation of the writing<br>on the Eryx paper. And got promptly suppressed by court injunction while<br>the Microsoft-IBM people sought corrob-orating evidence before releasing<br>it. I heard about it while I was in jail. Everybody on Earth heard about it.<br>(Except for you, my adorable Julie, caught up in your larcenous dreams.)<br>
 <br>I got out on good behavior (I’m no troublemaker) and drifted around<br>
Luna City for a while, working as a dish-washer. My spaceship piloting<br>career seemed to be dead. No license, and no one would have hired me if<br>I’d had one.<br>
 <br>But you can’t keep a good man down. A change of administration on<br>
Luna gave me the opportunity to regain a pilot’s license restricted to the<br>inner solar system. This was accomplished by my employer at the time,<br>Edgar Duarte, the owner of Luna Tours, who thought to use my fame or<br>notoriety to enhance his tourist business. And so I got a job taking day<br>trippers out to the asteroid belt, a far fall indeed for one who had<br>discovered the Eryx.<br>
 <br>I took it with equanimity, however: I’ve long known that fortune’s a<br>
whore and life itself a kind of stupid mud-dle. I am not a religious man. Far<br>from it. I hold, if anything, a belief which I believe was once ascribed to the<br>Gnostics: that Satan won out over God, not the other way around, and the<br>Dark Prince runs things in the dismal and disastrous way that suits his<br>nature. I knew that every-thing was just chance and bad luck, in a universe in<br>which things were stacked against us and even our ruling deity hated us.<br>
 <br>But since it’s all chance, good things happen from time to time, and,<br>
lo and behold, my time seemed to come around. I was running my tourists<br>out to these stupid aster-oids, sleeping in a flophouse since Duarte paid<br>me next to nothing, bored out of my mind, when one day I got a letter from<br>
<hr>
<A name=14></a>Earth.<br>
 <br>This letter was written on genuine paper, not this insub-stantial e-mail<br>
stuff, but on stiff parchmentlike paper. It was from something that<br>proclaimed itself “The First Church of the Eryx, Universal Pontifex of<br>Everything and All.”<br>
 <br>The letter was not humor, as I had at first supposed, but a serious<br>
message from a group that had formed a church for the worship of the<br>Eryx.<br>
 <br>The Eryx was a suprahuman principle, they wrote me, which had<br>
revealed itself to those who could see as di-vinely alien in form and in<br>essence, and this coming had been prophesied long ago because of the<br>self-evident na-ture of man’s fallen soul.<br>
 <br>In the letter they pointed out how the Eryx was now in a citadel in the<br>
Seattle Space Needle which had been ac-quired for it by Microsoft-IBM.<br>Thousands of people passed in front of it daily, looking for cures to what<br>ailed them. And the Eryx helped many of them. The Eryx had literally<br>thousands of miracles to its credit. Not only could and would it cure any and<br>all human ailments, everything went better in the presence of the Eryx, from<br>machinery (which I had been the first to observe) to the workings of the<br>human mind (of which the writer of the letter was an example, I suppose).<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>After quite a bit more of this, the writer, a Mr. Charles Ehrenzveig, got to the<br>point. It had recently come to the Church’s attention (he didn’t say how) that<br>I was the per-son who had discovered the Body of the Deity and brought it<br>to mankind. For this I was to be honored. It had been some years since I<br>had had any contact with the Source. I had been denied my rightful fame,<br>ignored where I ought to have been praised (my feelings exactly), and<br>forced to live meanly far from Earth, whereas by rights I should take my<br>place as The Discoverer of the Eryx. The letter also implied that there was<br>something holy about me by association and by primogeniture.<br>
 <br>Ehrenzveig closed by saying that they had bought a ticket for me, a<br>
passage to Earth. It was waiting in Ameri-can Express in Luna City. They<br>would be very pleased if I would come to Seattle as their guest, all<br>expenses paid. They promised to reimburse me handsomely if I would<br>come and talk to them about the circumstances of my expedition to<br>Alquemar, my discovery of the Eryx, my feelings during my time of<br>association with it, and so on and so forth.<br>
<hr>
<A name=15></a> <br>Would I come? You bet I would. Luna City had been a drag for quite<br>
a while, and I’d had enough of tourists and asteroids to last me a very long<br>time. With great pleasure I told Duarte where he could stick his job, and<br>shortly after that I was on my way to the home planet.<br>
 <br>A few weeks later, I was there.<br> <br>Julie, I won’t bore you with my impressions of Earth after an absence<br>
of almost ten years. All of that and a lot more is part of my standard lecture.<br>It’s available now both as a book and a CD. If you want, you can look it up<br>for yourself. (But I know you, my darling. Not interested in anyone but<br>yourself, are you?)<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>“Dalton! How good that you could come!” That was Ehrenzveig, a big,<br>corpulent man, greeting me literally with open arms. He had a couple of<br>other guys with him. They were all dressed in white. That was one of the<br>marks of the cult, I later found out.<br>
 <br>I was brought by limousine to Eryx House, their own church and<br>
residence on a private island in Puget Sound. I was wined and dined. They<br>made much of me. It was very pleasant. Except that there was a strange<br>undertone to everything Ehrenzveig and the others said. What the psych<br>people might call a subtext. They knew something that I and the rest of the<br>human race didn’t know, and they felt very smug about that.<br> <br>
* * * *<br>
 <br>The next day they brought me to the Space Needle for the Viewing, as they<br>called it. The way it worked for the peasants, they got a ticket (free from the<br>Eryx foundation, but you had to have one), then were searched for<br>weapons, then were allowed to form on the line that went all the way up to<br>the viewing room, which they called the Citadel. I didn’t have to do this. But<br>Ehrenzveig thought I might like to see how it was done.<br>
 <br>I was more than a little surprised at the numbers of sick and crippled<br>
people on that line. There were blind folks, people with cancer, and just<br>about everything else. They were all hoping for a miracle cure. A lot of<br>them, Ehrenz-veig assured me, were going to get it.<br>
 <br>I must have looked skeptical, because Ehrenzveig said, “Oh, it’s real<br>
enough. It’s not a matter of faith; it simply works. The other religions don’t<br>
<hr>
<A name=16></a>know what to do with us. The Eryx—actually performs miracles. All of the<br>time. Every day. This is a stage that our prophets have written about. We<br>call it the Grace of the Last Days.”<br>
 <br>“The Last Days? What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked him.<br> <br>He looked sly. “I’m afraid I can’t discuss the inner doctrine with you.”<br> <br>“Why not? I thought you considered me a founder.”<br> <br>“A founder, yes, but not a member of our religion. You discovered the<br>
Eryx, Mr. Dalton, and for that we will always honor you. But you do not<br>believe in its supernatu-ral message. And because of that, we will not open<br>our hearts and minds to you.”<br>
 <br>I shrugged. What are you going to say when a guy lays a rap like that<br>
on you? And anyhow, I didn’t tell that to Ehrenzveig. The guy was my meal<br>ticket, and I didn’t want to get him sore at me. Not yet. Not until I had<br>something going for myself.<br>
 <br>You see, Julie, and I’m sure you’ll appreciate this point, I had gotten a<br>
free trip to Earth and I was being put up in what amounted to a fancy resort<br>hotel. But there’s been no talk of money. Scratch. The mojo. The stuff that<br>makes it all go around.<br>
 <br>I didn’t bring this up, however. Not at that time. I was kinda sure<br>
Ehrenzveig and his people were going to make me an offer of some kind.<br>After all, without me they wouldn’t have had a religion.<br>
 <br>I spent quite some time in the little room viewing the Eryx through<br>
glass. They had it on the cylinder of stone I’d found it on. I hadn’t bothered<br>to bring the cylinder back. They’d made a special expedition to Alquemar to<br>fetch it. The room was designed to look just like the cave in which Gomez<br>and I had made our discovery. Even the lighting was the same. And they’d<br>replaced the cloth the Eryx had rested on. The Eryx was sitting on it again,<br>looking pretty as a picture, the very last word in high-class alien artifacts.<br>
 <br>“I thought somebody was studying that cloth,” I remarked.<br> <br>“Guillot, yes. But our foundation was able to suppress his translation<br>
and reclaim the cloth. It belongs with the Eryx, you understand. It is part of<br>its substance.”<br>
 <br>“Do you know what the thing says?”<br>
<hr>
<A name=17></a> <br>“We have our surmises.”<br> <br>“So?”<br> <br>“If you think I am going to tell you, Mr. Dalton, you are very mistaken.<br>
That knowledge will be made public when the time is right.”<br>
 <br>“And when will that be?”<br> <br>“The Eryx itself will give us the indication.”<br> <br>So we stood around for a while watching guys throw away their<br>
crutches, and other guys shout, “I can see!” and all the rest of the bullshit.<br>And then they took me back to Eryx House for a really first-rate banquet in<br>my honor. It was after that dinner that Ehrenzveig made the proposition I’d<br>been expecting.<br>
 <br>We were sitting with cigars and brandy in this superluxurious sitting<br>
room down the hall from the main dining room. At first it was a bunch of us,<br>me and Ehrenzveig and about ten others who were pretty obviously bigwigs<br>in the organization. Then the others left as if on signal, and Ehrenzveig said,<br>“You’re probably wondering by now what this could possibly have to do with<br>you, Mr. Dalton.”<br>
 <br>“The question did cross my mind,” I said.<br> <br>“If I have not read your character amiss,” Ehrenzveig said, “I believe,<br>
you would like money. Quite a large amount of money. Or am I being too<br>direct?”<br>
 <br>“Not at all. I’m all for plain speaking and high living.”<br> <br>“Excellent. We can give you both.”<br> <br>“High living,” I mused. “Does that translate into actual cash of the<br>
realm, or do I get paid in religious points in the organization?”<br>
 <br>Ehrenzveig smiled. “We are well aware that you are not a believer.<br>
That’s fine. You’re not required to be. Would it make you uncomfortable to<br>know that we’d like to use you as a shill?”<br>
 <br>“Not if there’s any money in it.”<br> <br>
<hr>
<A name=18></a>“Excellent! I appreciate your candor.”<br> <br>“You don’t mind, then, that I think your religion of the Eryx is a lot of<br>
bullshit, to put it bluntly?”<br>
 <br>“I don’t mind at all. These are modern times, Mr. Dal-ton, and the test<br>
of a modern religion resides in how it performs, not in what it promises. And<br>in a religion such as ours, there’s certainly no moral or ethical code. Such<br>matters have nothing to do with a diety such as ours. The Eryx, whom some<br>call the Great Satan, couldn’t care less about right or wrong, good or bad.<br>He’s here for one thing and one thing only.”<br>
 <br>“And that thing is?”<br> <br>“It will be plain to you in good time,” Ehrenzveig said. “I predict that<br>
you will become a believer. And that’ll be a pity, because we’ll have lost<br>ourselves a jovial and cynical rogue.”<br>
 <br>“Flattery will get you nowhere,” I said, “unless you accompany it with<br>
large sums of money. Don’t worry about supplying me with dancing girls. I’ll<br>take care of details like that myself.”<br>
 <br>“The money, yes,” Ehrenzveig said. “How admirably direct you are.<br>
But I came prepared for you.”<br>
 <br>Ehrenzveig took a billfold out of an inner pocket and counted out ten<br>
thousand-dollar bills. He riffled them and handed them to me.<br>
 <br>“Is this what I’m being paid?”<br> <br>“Certainly not. This is just a little walking-around money. We’re going<br>
to pay you a lot more than this, Mr. Dalton.”<br>
 <br>“And what am I supposed to do for it?”<br> <br>“Just talk to people.”<br> <br>“You mean, give lectures?”<br> <br>“Whatever you want to call them.”<br> <br>“What do you want me to tell them?”<br> <br>“Whatever you wish. You might talk about how you discovered the<br>
<hr>
<A name=19></a>Eryx. But you need not confine yourself to that. Tell them about yourself.<br>Your life. Your opinions.”<br>
 <br>“Why should anyone be interested in my life?”<br> <br>“Whatever you care to say will be of interest. In our religion, Mr.<br>
Dalton, you hold a very significant place.”<br>
 <br>“I told you I’m not religious.”<br> <br>“Important figures in religion frequently are not. Reli-gious people<br>
come afterwards. They were the interpreters. But the original cast, the ones<br>who were there in the begin-ning, they are not necessarily religious. Often<br>they are quite the contrary.”<br>
 <br>“I’ve got a place in your religion? Like Judas, maybe?”<br> <br>“Equal in importance, but nothing like him. We refer to you, Mr.<br>
Dalton, as the Last Adam.”<br>
 <br>Talking has never been any problem for me, and I didn’t care if they<br>
called me the Last Adam or the First Charley. Or the Sixteenth Llewellyn,<br>for that matter. A name is just another container for the wailing pile of shit<br>that is a man. If you’ll pardon my French. But you’ve heard language like this<br>all your life, haven’t you, Julie? It’s the way your father talked, and your<br>mother, and all your friends. They all were a bunch of blasphemers, weren’t<br>they, doll? And you knew right from the start, right from the get-go, that the<br>only thing to do in this world was to look out for number one, live high and<br>leave a good-looking corpse. You and I are so alike, Julie. That’s why you<br>love me so.<br>
 <br>I guess, as I went on giving my talks in Seattle, I started talking more<br>
about you, Julie girl. People started asking me, who is this Julie you’re<br>always raving about? And I’d always tell them, she’s my dream girl, and she<br>knows the way things really are. I told that to the ladies who kept me<br>company during this time. There were a lot of them. I was famous, you see.<br>I was Dalton, the guy who had found the Eryx.<br>
 <br>Thanks to Ehrenzveig and his people, others began to see how<br>
important I was. They paid me a lot. They gave me respect.<br>
 <br>“We’re going to fulfill your dreams of avarice, John,” Ehrenzveig said<br>
one day. It was a joke, I think, but he made it true. He kept on piling money<br>on me, and I kept on buying things, and people, and more things. I had me<br>
<hr>
<A name=20></a>a time, let me tell you. It was going so good for me that I didn’t even notice<br>for quite a while that a lot of people were dying.<br>
 <br>When you’re going good, like I was, you sort of over-look what other<br>
people are up to. I mean, let’s face it, who gives a damn about other people<br>when there’s number one to be fed and pleasured? And as good as things<br>might get, there’s always room for improvement, right? So I took little notice<br>of the bad stuff that was going on. The die-off, I mean. It was all very tragic.<br>But I couldn’t help thinking that it was for the best, in a weird sort of way,<br>because it freed up a lot of real estate. And of course I wasn’t very<br>interested in why it was happening.<br>
 <br>A lot of people were blaming it on the Eryx. That’s people for you.<br>
Always ready to blame something. There were even scientists around<br>eager to get their names in the papers, saying that the Eryx was a living<br>organism, of a type never before seen. Long dormant. Now coming into<br>activity. According to those guys, the Eryx had been releasing viruses since<br>the day I found it. These viruses had traveled around the world, lodging in<br>people’s bodies, not doing any harm, not calling any attention to<br>them-selves, the sly little buggers. But this wasn’t out of good nature. This<br>was because this Eryx virus was waiting, waiting until it had spread to the<br>whole Earth, infected everyone. Then it took off like a timed-release<br>capsule.<br>
 <br>It got pretty bad, this die-off thing. And I guess I went out of my way<br>
not to notice it. Because if you’re going to die anyway, why depress<br>yourself in advance with bad news? And anyhow, I figured some of those<br>scientists they got out there would do something about it. And if not, not. It<br>was Ehrenzveig who finally clued me in to what was going on. To where it<br>was all leading. He came to visit me one morning. Frankly, he looked like<br>hell—red-eyed, and his hands were shaking. It occurred to me that he’d<br>caught this disease, and I had a little tremor of fear. If he got it, and him so<br>high up in the Church of the Eryx, then I could get it, too.<br>
 <br>“You look like death warmed over,” I told him. No sense kidding<br>
around.<br>
 <br>“Yes. I’ve got it. Eryx Fever. I don’t have long.” “Hasn’t your god come<br>
up with a cure?” Ehrenzveig shook his head. “That’s not his way.” “Then<br>what’s the advantage of being in his church?” “Some of us think knowledge<br>is worth anything.” “Not me,” I told him.<br>
 <br>Ehrenzveig spent a while coughing. Quite pathetic it was. Finally he<br>
was able to speak again.<br>
<hr>
<A name=21></a> <br>“I’ve come to tell you the translation of the cloth that was found with<br>
the Eryx.” “I’m all ears.”<br>
 <br>“It was a warning. It was written by one of the last beings to come<br>
across the Eryx.”<br>
 <br>“Let’s cut to the chase. What did it say?” ‘ ‘It said, ‘The Eryx hates<br>
human life. It hates alien life. It tolerates no life but its own. When you find<br>the Eryx, it is the beginning of the end of your species.’ I’m translat-ing very<br>freely, you understand.”<br>
 <br>“No problem,” I said. “It sounds like one of those old Egyptian<br>
curses.”<br>
 <br>“Yes, very similar. In this case, it happens to be true.”<br> <br>“That’s great,” I said, sarcastically, because of course Ehrenzveig<br>
was reading my own death sentence as well as his. But hey, I never thought<br>I’d go on forever.<br>
 <br>“So what happens now? Masque of the Red Death on a whole-world<br>
scale?”<br>
 <br>“That’s about the size of it,” Ehrenzveig said.<br> <br>“How long have you known?”<br> <br>“For quite a while. All of us in the religion of the Eryx have known. The<br>
Eryx told us.”<br>
 <br>“How’d it do that? Send out thoughts?”<br> <br>“Dreams. Prophetic dreams. And we accepted what it told us, and<br>
found it good. It is only right, you see, that the Eryx can tolerate no other life<br>than its own.”<br>
 <br>“That’s understandable,” I said. “I like a little elbow room, too.”<br> <br>Ehrenzveig bowed his head and didn’t speak.<br> <br>Finally I asked him, “So what happens now?”<br> <br>“I die,” Ehrenzveig said. “Everyone dies.”<br>
<hr>
<A name=22></a> <br>“That’s obvious, dummy. I mean what happens to me?”<br> <br>“Ah,” Ehrnezveig said, “the Eryx has plans for you. You’re the Last<br>
Adam.”<br>
 <br>“What sort of plans?”<br> <br>“You’ll see. Come with me.”<br> <br>“On whose orders?”<br> <br>“The Eryx wants to get a look at you.”<br> <br>Well, I didn’t like the sound of that one bit. I decided it was about time<br>
to quit the organization, get away from the Earth, find something else. But<br>Ehrenzveig wasn’t hav-ing it that way. He had a bunch of his buddies<br>outside my door. They escorted me—under protest, I can assure you—to<br>this place where I live now.<br>
 <br>The followers of the Eryx bustled around me for the next few weeks,<br>
setting me up in my little apartment, installing the cameras, arranging for<br>food. There were fewer of them every day, and finally I was here all alone.<br>Locked in.<br>
 <br>But even if I could get out, where would I go? I’ve got a feeling<br>
everybody’s gone now. I saw my last human face weeks, months ago.<br>Frankly, I don’t miss people one bit. They were a bad lot and to hell with<br>them. I’m glad they’re gone and I won’t be sorry when I’m gone, too.<br>
 <br>I’ve never seen the Eryx, but I suspect he’s taken some form other<br>
than that in which I found him. He’s studying me, I think. Maybe he studies<br>the last specimen of each race he annihilates. Just out of curiosity, I<br>suppose. That’s what I’d do. Maybe the Eryx and I aren’t so different.<br>Except for our circumstances. He’s got the world. The galaxy, I suppose.<br>And I have one room and a bathroom and a glassed-in enclosure. And you,<br>Julie.<br> <br>

<b>AFTERWORD</b><br>
 <br>
I only knew Roger Zelazny through our three novel collab-orations. We met<br>in the flesh only a few times. Working with Roger was one of the great<br>
<hr>
<A name=23></a>pleasures of my life. Roger was a great combination of intuitive genius,<br>fantasy dreamer, and careful, punctilious story plotter. He was one of the<br>great ones. I greatly regret not having had the oppor-tunity to know him<br>better. But I can’t tell you how pleased I am at having had the privilege of<br>working with him. Collaboration tells you a lot about a person, and about<br>yourself.<br> <br>
