ROBERT SHECKLEY<BR>
<BR>
EMISSARY FROM A GREEN AND YELLOW WORLD<BR>
<BR>
Of late, Bob Sheckley has been 
writing mostly mystery novels, including Soma<BR>
Blues and Draconian New York. He's currently 
finishing up a new fantasy entitled<BR>
Godshome. Of course, Bob has also been entertaining us 
with skewed short stories<BR>
for four decades now, and it's nice to see he's not letting up. 
Witness this<BR>
story of a visit to a blue and white world.<BR>
<BR>
ONE THING ABOUT PRESIDENT Rice. He 
was able to make up his mind. When Ong came<BR>
to Earth with his contention, Rice believed 
him. Not that it made any difference<BR>
in the end.<BR>
<BR>
It began when the Marine guard came into 
the Oval Office, his face ashen.<BR>
<BR>
"What is it:." said President Rice, looking up from his 
papers.<BR>
<BR>
"Someone wants to see you," the guard said.<BR>
<BR>
"So? A lot of people want to see the 
President of the United States. Is his name<BR>
on the morning list?"<BR>
<BR>
"You don't understand, 
sir. This guy -- he just -- materialized! One moment he<BR>
wasn't there and the next moment, 
there he was, standing in front of me in the<BR>
corridor. And he isn't a man, sir. He stands 
on two legs but he isn't a man.<BR>
He's --he's -- I don't know what he is!"<BR>
<BR>
And the guard burst 
into tears.<BR>
<BR>
Rice had seen other men cave in from the pressures of government. But what did 
a<BR>
Marine guard have to do with pressures?<BR>
<BR>
"Listen, son," Rice said.<BR>
<BR>
The guard hastily rubbed 
tears out of his eyes. "Yes, sir." His voice was shaky,<BR>
but it wasn't hysterical.<BR>
<BR>
"What I 
want you to do," Rice said, "is take the rest of the day off. Go home.<BR>
Get some rest. Come 
back here tomorrow refreshed. If your supervisor asks about<BR>
it, tell him I ordered it. Will 
you do that for me?"<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, sir."<BR>
<BR>
"And on your way, send in that fellow you met in the 
corridor. The one you say<BR>
doesn't look human. Don't talk to him. Just tell him I'm waiting 
to see him."<BR>
<BR>
The fellow was not long in coming. He was about six feet tall. He wore a 
silver<BR>
one-piece jump suit that shimmered when you looked at it. His features were<BR>
difficult 
to describe. All you could say for sure was, he didn't look human.<BR>
<BR>
"I know what you're 
thinking," the fellow said. "You are thinking that I don't<BR>
look human."<BR>
<BR>
"That's right," Rice 
said.<BR>
<BR>
"You're correct. I'm not human. Intelligent, yes. Human, no. You can call me<BR>
Ong. I'm 
from Omair, a planet in the constellation you call Sagittarius. Omair<BR>
is a yellow and green 
world. Do you believe me?"<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, I believe you," Rice said.<BR>
<BR>
"May I ask why?"<BR>
<BR>
"It's just a 
hunch," Rice said. "I think that if you stayed around here and<BR>
submitted to an examination 
by a team of our scientists, they'd conclude that<BR>
you were an alien. So let's get right to 
it. You're an alien. I accept that<BR>
you're from a green and yellow world named Oreair. Now 
what?"<BR>
<BR>
"You're asking, I suppose, why I've come here, at this time?"<BR>
<BR>
"That's right."<BR>
<BR>
"Well, 
sir, I've come to warn you that your sun is going to go nova in about one<BR>
hundred and fifty 
of your years."<BR>
<BR>
"You're sure?"<BR>
<BR>
"Quite sure."<BR>
<BR>
"Why'd you wait so long to get around to telling 
us?"<BR>
<BR>
"We just found out ourselves. As soon as it was confirmed, my people sent me as<BR>
emissary 
to give your planet the information and offer what assistance we<BR>
could."<BR>
<BR>
"Why did they pick 
you?"<BR>
<BR>
"I was chosen at random for off-planet service. It could have been any of US."<BR>
<BR>
"If you 
say so."<BR>
<BR>
"Now I have delivered the message. How can we help?"<BR>
<BR>
Rice was feeling very 
peculiar. He didn't understand it, but he really did<BR>
believe the emissary. But he also knew 
his belief was futile in terms of saving<BR>
Earth's people. Ong's contention would have to be 
submitted to scientific proof.<BR>
Before any conclusions could be reached, the Earth would 
vaporize in the<BR>
expanding sun. Rice knew that if he wanted to do anything about it, it 
would<BR>
have to begin now.<BR>
<BR>
Rice said, "Some of our scientists have made similar conjectures as 
to our<BR>
eventual doom."<BR>
<BR>
"They're right. Within approximately one hundred and fifty years this 
planet<BR>
will no longer be habitable. May I be blunt? You're going to have to get off.<BR>
All of 
you. And you must begin immediately."<BR>
<BR>
"Great," President Rice said. "Oh, that's just 
great."<BR>
<BR>
"Is something wrong?"<BR>
<BR>
"I'm just having a little trouble assimilating this." Rice put 
a hand to his<BR>
forehead. "This is a nightmare situation. But I have to deal with it as if 
it's<BR>
real. Because it probably is." He wiped his forehead again. "Let's say I believe<BR>
you. 
How could we do anything about it?"<BR>
<BR>
"We of Omair are ready to help. We will give you 
detailed plans explaining what<BR>
you must do to make starships for all Earth's people. There 
will be further<BR>
instructions for getting all the people together and into the ships in an
<BR>
orderly manner. Please understand, we're just trying to help, not impose<BR>
ourselves on you." 
"I believe you," Rice said, and he did.<BR>
<BR>
"There's a lot to be done," the emissary said. 
"It's a big task, but you humans<BR>
are just as smart as we Omairians -- we checked on that, 
no use wasting our time<BR>
on dummies. With your present level of technology, and with our 
assistance, you<BR>
can do this and be away within the next hundred years."<BR>
<BR>
"It's a tremendously 
exciting prospect," Rice said.<BR>
<BR>
"We thought you'd feel that way. You aren't the only 
planetary civilization<BR>
we've been able to rescue."<BR>
<BR>
"That is very much to your credit."<BR>
<BR>
"Nothing 
to praise. This is how we Omairians are."<BR>
<BR>
"I'm going to have to ask something that may 
sound a little strange," Rice said.<BR>
"But this is Earth so I have to ask it. Who's going to 
pay for all this?"<BR>
<BR>
"If it's necessary," Ong said, "we of Omair are willing to defray the 
costs."<BR>
<BR>
"Thank you. That's very good of you."<BR>
<BR>
"We know."<BR>
<BR>
"So what will be necessary?"<BR>
<BR>
"To 
begin with, you'll need to clear out the center of one of your continents<BR>
for the 
launchingpads. But that's not too difficult, because you can distribute<BR>
the people in the 
other continents. That will disrupt commerce and farming, of<BR>
course. But we will supply 
whatever food is needed."<BR>
<BR>
Rice could imagine it now -- the slow convening of experts from 
all over the<BR>
globe, the quarreling, the demands for more and more proofs. And even if a<BR>
consensus 
of scientists came to agreement after many years, what about the<BR>
population at large? 
Before any sizeable portion of the Earth's people could be<BR>
convinced, the Earth would long 
since have vaporized in the expanding sun.<BR>
<BR>
"Simultaneous to the building of the starships," 
the emissary went on, "you'll<BR>
have to get your populations indoctrinated, innoculated 
-we'll supply the<BR>
medicines -- and in general prepared for a long journey by starship. 
During the<BR>
transition period you'll require temporary housing for millions. We can help<BR>
there."
<BR>
<BR>
"Is the indoctrination really necessary? Earth people hate that sort of thing."<BR>
<BR>
"Absolutely 
essential. Your people will not be prepared for a lifetime of<BR>
shipboard life. Hypnotherapy 
may be needed in many cases. We can supply the<BR>
machines. I know your people won't like it, 
being uprooted this way. But it's<BR>
either that or perish in about a hundred years."<BR>
<BR>
"I'm 
convinced," Rice said. "The question is, can I sell it?"<BR>
<BR>
"I beg your pardon?"<BR>
<BR>
"Well, it's 
not just a case of convincing me, you know. There are tens of<BR>
millions of people out there 
who won't believe you."<BR>
<BR>
"But surely if you order them to take the necessary measures for 
their own<BR>
good..."<BR>
<BR>
"I'm just the ruler of one country, not the whole planet. And I can't 
even order<BR>
my own countrymen to do what you're suggesting."<BR>
<BR>
"You don't have to order it. 
Just suggest it and show the proofs. Humans are<BR>
intelligent. They'll acccept your view."
<BR>
<BR>
Rice shook his head. "Believe me, they won't believe me. Most of them will think<BR>
this is a 
diabolical plot on the part of government, or some church, or the<BR>
Islamic Conspiracy, or 
some other. Some will think little gray aliens are trying<BR>
to trick us into captivity. 
Others will believe it's the work of a long-vanished<BR>
Elder Race, here to do us in. Whatever 
the reason, everyone will be sure it's a<BR>
plot of some kind."<BR>
<BR>
"A plot to do what?" Ong asked.
<BR>
<BR>
"To enslave us."<BR>
<BR>
"We of Omair don't do that sort of thing. We have a perfect record in that
<BR>
regard. I can offer proofs."<BR>
<BR>
"You keep on talking about proofs," Rice said. "But most 
humans are<BR>
proof-proof."<BR>
<BR>
"Is that really true?."<BR>
<BR>
"Sad to say, it's true."<BR>
<BR>
"It goes against 
accepted theory. We have always believed that intelligence<BR>
invariably produces 
rationality."<BR>
<BR>
"Not in these parts. Not with us."<BR>
<BR>
"I'm sorry to hear that. We Omairians 
thought this was just a matter of one<BR>
colleague calling on another and warning him of a 
danger, then advising him on<BR>
what steps to take. I had no idea humans might resist 
believing. It's not<BR>
rational, you know. Are you quite sure of this?"<BR>
<BR>
"That's how humans are. 
And above all, they're conditioned from earliest age<BR>
against taking orders from aliens."
<BR>
<BR>
"I wouldn't be giving any orders."<BR>
<BR>
"You'd be advising the government. In people's minds, 
that would be the<BR>
equivalent of giving orders."<BR>
<BR>
"I don't know what to tell you," the 
emissary said. "Is there really no way you<BR>
could convince people otherwise?"<BR>
<BR>
"I can tell you 
here and now, it'll never work."<BR>
<BR>
Ong gave a slight inclination of his head. "Well, it has 
been nice meeting you.<BR>
Have a nice day."<BR>
<BR>
The emissary turned to go.<BR>
<BR>
"Just one moment," Rice 
said.<BR>
<BR>
The alien paused, turned. "Yes?"<BR>
<BR>
"What about just taking those of us who do believe, 
who want to go?"<BR>
<BR>
"It's unprecedented," the emissary said. "In all our experience, races 
either<BR>
can change their thinking and get away from their doomed worlds by their own<BR>
efforts, 
or they cannot."<BR>
<BR>
"We're different," Rice said.<BR>
<BR>
"All right," the emissary said. "I'll do it. 
Gather your people. I'll be back in<BR>
ten years to take those who want to go. We can't wait 
any longer than that."<BR>
<BR>
"We'll be ready."<BR>
<BR>
TEN YEARS LATER, the emissary came to a small, 
hand-built house in a corner of<BR>
the Oregon Cascade Mountains. A trout stream ran behind the 
house, and Rice was<BR>
standing beside the stream, fishing. Rice said, "How did you find me 
here?"<BR>
<BR>
"Once we Omairians have met you, we can always find you again. But t think you<BR>
are 
not president any longer."<BR>
<BR>
"No," Rice said. "My term ended and I didn't get reelected. I 
tried to convince<BR>
people of the destruction that lay ahead. Nearly everyone thought I was a
<BR>
crackpot. Those who did believe me were worse than those who didn't. A crazy man<BR>
tried to 
shoot me and killed my wife instead. My children hold me responsible.<BR>
They changed their 
names and moved away."<BR>
<BR>
"I am sorry to hear that," the emissary said. "But I think you'll 
have to admit<BR>
that those other people, the ones who despise and disbelieve you, do not have
<BR>
your grasp, your intelligence, your intuition. You're probably the most unusual<BR>
man of your 
century, Mr. Rice. You believed in us from the start. You didn't<BR>
think we were sent by God 
or the devil. You accepted what we said. Evidently you<BR>
were the only one."<BR>
<BR>
"Evidently."<BR>
<BR>
"Perhaps 
it's for the best," the emissary said. "Your people, in their present<BR>
state, could never 
have made it out there. But you could."<BR>
<BR>
"Me?"<BR>
<BR>
"Your true place is with us, Mr. Rice, out in 
the galaxy. There is still time.<BR>
You are not an old man. We have rejuvenation treatments. 
We can add many years<BR>
to your life. We have women of our species who would be honored to 
mate with<BR>
you. We have a civilization that would welcome you. I beg of you, leave this<BR>
doomed 
Earth behind and come away with<BR>
<BR>
"No, I think not," Rice said. "I can still look forward to 
living another thirty<BR>
or so years on Earth before things get too bad, can't I?"<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, but no 
longer."<BR>
<BR>
"It's enough. I'll stay."<BR>
<BR>
"You choose to die here with your people? But they will 
perish because of their<BR>
own ignorance."<BR>
<BR>
"Yes. But they are Earth's children, as I am. My 
place is here with Them."<BR>
<BR>
"I find it difficult to believe you're saying this."<BR>
<BR>
"I did a lot 
of thinking about it. It occurred to me that I was really no<BR>
different from the other 
humans. Not fundamentally. And certainly no better."<BR>
<BR>
"I can't accept that. Anyhow, what is 
your inference?"<BR>
<BR>
"It seemed to me that if my species was incapable of believing in its own 
doom,<BR>
it was not for me to believe in it, either. So I've decided that all that stuff<BR>
you 
talked about is not going to happen. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've dreamed<BR>
all this up."
<BR>
<BR>
"It is not intelligence," said the emissary, "to take refuge in solipsism."<BR>
<BR>
"My mind's made 
up. I'll stay here with my trout stream. You've never done any<BR>
fly fishing, have you, 
emissary?"<BR>
<BR>
"Where I come from," the emissary said, "we don't fish. We respect all life."
<BR>
<BR>
"Does that mean you don't eat flesh of any kind?"<BR>
<BR>
"That is correct."<BR>
<BR>
"What about vegetables? 
They're living things."<BR>
<BR>
"We don't eat vegetables, either. We convert our energy from inert 
chemicals,<BR>
or, if necessary, we transform it directly from solar radiation. We can<BR>
re-engineer 
you so you can do that, too."<BR>
<BR>
"I'll just bet you can," Rice said. "I beg your pardon?"<BR>
<BR>
"You 
heard me. Or rather, you heard my implication. The sort of life you offer<BR>
wouldn't be 
human. It would be hellish. It wouldn't be worth living for a fellow<BR>
like me, to say 
nothing of my friends. I refer to the rest of the human race."<BR>
<BR>
"You mentioned hell. There 
is no hell."<BR>
<BR>
"Yes there is. Hell is me talking to you. Now do me a favor and get out of my
<BR>
face."<BR>
<BR>
The emissary left, and, outside, paused for a moment, looking back at the house.<BR>
Would 
Rice change his mind? No indication of it. Ong shrugged and returned to<BR>
his vehicle. With a 
gesture he brought it up to full visibility and got aboard.<BR>
<BR>
Soon he was high in the air, 
with the green and blue planet receding below him.<BR>
Soon he would put in the faster than 
light drive.<BR>
<BR>
But just before he did, he turned back and took a last look. A Good-looking
<BR>
planet, and intelligent people. A pity to see it all lost.<BR>
<BR>
He brooded for a moment, but 
only a moment. Then he consoled himself with the<BR>
knowledge that this represented no real 
loss to the Cosmos. After all,<BR>
intelligent life had evolved again and again on planets all 
over the universe.<BR>
<BR>
But what had evolved was intelligent life much like that of Ong and his 
people.<BR>
That was the standard, the norm. But intelligent life like Earth's? Intelligent<BR>
irrational 
life? It had to be a fluke, a one-of-a-kind thing, this mating of<BR>
intelligence and 
irrationality. The emissary didn't think the universe had seen<BR>
Earth's like before. It 
probably would not again.<BR>
<BR>
He looked down once more at the Earth. It looked like a nice 
place. But of<BR>
course, there were more where that came from. Sort of. In any event, it was 
time<BR>
to get back to his own green and yellow world.<BR>
