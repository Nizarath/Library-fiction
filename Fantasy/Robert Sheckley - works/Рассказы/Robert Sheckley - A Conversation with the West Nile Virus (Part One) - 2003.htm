        Great inventions sometimes come about in unorthodox ways. So it was with 
        the first DNA computer. Jensen put down his soldering iron. "It's ready 
        to go." Bailey peered at the machine on the worktable. It was a messy 
        accumulation of motherboards, diodes, anodes, silicon chips, and, in their 
        tiny glass cases, the all-important DNA chips. A microphone was connected, 
        too. An endless array of multi-colored wires tied everything to everything 
        else. If Jensen was correct, this computer would have unprecedented power 
        and speed. Jensen was a computer maker and an itinerant genius, a middle-aged, 
        small, sour-faced man who couldn't hold a job at any major software company 
        because of his unorthodox ways. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bailey 
        had hired Jensen, financing the work from a sizeable inheritance left 
        him by his mother. Bailey was a tall, stoop-shouldered man in his early 
        forties. Little spectacles perched precariously on his high forehead.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And 
        it'll work?" Bailey asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"If 
        the theory's correct, it ought to. Shall we fire it up and see?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Not 
        quite yet," Bailey said. "First I need to propose a problem."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"There's 
        plenty to choose from," Jensen said. "Want to solve for world peace? See 
        what global warning is up to? Check up on threatening asteroids?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They 
        are all important," Bailey said. "But I would like to start with something 
        important but not crucial. And keep it our own secret until we've solved 
        it."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You're 
        the money man," Jensen said. "You got a problem in mind?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Bailey nodded. "In three words."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And 
        they are?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"West 
        Nile Virus."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That's 
        that Egyptian virus, isn't it?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Originally 
        detected in Uganda, in the West Nile Province. The way it works, infected 
        mosquitoes bite humans and animals, transmitting the virus. The virus 
        interferes with normal central nervous system functioning, multiplies, 
        and travels to the brain where it causes inflammation and death."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Sounds 
        serious," Jensen said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It 
        can and does kill," Bailey said. "But even in a mosquito-infested area, 
        less than one percent of mosquitoes will pick up the virus, and less than 
        one percent of people bitten will become seriously ill. Of course, viruses 
        mutate. It could all change. But that's the situation at present. "</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Sounds 
        like a pretty good test situation," Jensen said. "I suppose you have some 
        ideas for how talk to the virus?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Bailey nodded. "There's a theory that families of viruses may possess 
        something we would call group consciousness. If that is so, we can contact 
        this virus, talk to it through high-speed translators, maybe work something 
        out."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Making 
        a deal with a virus!" Jensen said. "This is something I have to see!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Me, 
        too," Bailey said. "I've got all the data here." He held up a small aluminum 
        briefcase. "I have a live infected mosquito. And we have your DNA translator. 
        Let's see how it all works together."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"How 
        did you get your data?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Evelyn, 
        my wife, supplied me with it. She's a researcher at the Center for Disease 
        Control here in Atlanta. Coming up with a cure or an eradication for West 
        Nile would do wonders for her career. It's the best anniversary present 
        I can think of."</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It required endless adjusting and calibrating to get the DNA computer 
        running. The sun had dropped below the horizon and the big overhead fluorescents 
        had come on before Jensen declared they were ready. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'm 
        sure your wife will appreciate it," Jensen said. "OK, we're ready to begin. 
        We have connection between you and the virus. Another first! Just talk 
        to it. The translator should handle the exchange."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Bailey tapped the microphone and said into it, "This is Thomas Bailey, 
        and I'm trying to speak to what we call the West Nile Virus."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        There was a suspicious sound in the loudspeaker. Then a voice said, " 
        Hey, who is this?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        told you. I'm Tom Bailey-"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        never heard of a virus named Tom Bailey."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'm 
        not a virus! I'm a human being!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"So 
        how come you can talk to me?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I've 
        got a machine that translates what I say into your language, and vice 
        versa."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That's 
        amazing. Not even other viruses can speak our language. Or they speak 
        it, but with the most terrible accents. Yours is pretty good. Did you 
        learn it in Uganda? That's where we started out, you know."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        know," Bailey said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Back 
        in dear old West Nile Province. But you've got an accent. I'd place you 
        as a southern West Nile province speaker. How's your translating machine 
        handling the thought I'm sending you by the dzaza jalgaboo?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Pretty 
        well, for the most part," Bailey said. "Occasionally there's a word or 
        two I don't understand, but I can usually make out the meaning."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Dsalih 
        peek, we West Nile viruses often temper our speech with nonsense syllabification, 
        gazagy boo. To put who we're speaking with at ease, and to keep up the 
        noise to signal ration."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Interesting... 
        Listen, I got a favor to ask you."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Tell 
        me, namgale do."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Well, 
        we we'd like you to stop infecting humans. People are dying, and their 
        wives, husbands and children resent it."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Humans? 
        You mean the tall ones who stand on two appendages, except when they're 
        lying down, of course, presumably to sleep. We West Nile viruses don't 
        sleep, ourselves, but we deduced the custom from the behavior of non-viral 
        creatures around us. You want us to quit infecting humans?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes, 
        if it wouldn't be too much trouble."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"How 
        come you're asking rather than demanding?" Jensen asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's 
        the civilized way to go," Bailey said. "Anyhow, I don't know what to threaten 
        viruses with."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No 
        need for anyone to threaten anyone," the virus said. "By the way, my name 
        is Ching. I'm a part of the universal West Nile viral mind, of course, 
        but I also have my own individuality."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        hail your individuality," Bailey said. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And 
        I yours," replied Ching.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This 
        is the craziest thing I ever heard," Jenson muttered to himself. "Both 
        of these guys would fail a Turing test! Yet still, they seem to be getting 
        somewhere."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Who 
        was that?" Ching asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"A 
        friend, pay no attention to him," Bailey said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Anyhow, 
        you want us West Nile viruses to leave you humans alone?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That's 
        the general idea."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        speak for all of us when I say I'd like to oblige you. But we need you 
        big humans in our diet."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Suppose 
        I can offer you something better than humans, or at least as good?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        did you have in mind?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Hamsters.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Now 
        I've heard everything," Jensen said, again aloud but to himself. "Hamsters? 
        Those little furry things? How did he come up with hamsters?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That's 
        the beauty part," Bailey said. "My cousin, Floyd, breeds hamsters and 
        guinea pigs commercially. Labs use them as experimental animals. You viruses 
        can, too."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"But 
        can you supply them in sufficient quantity?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'm 
        sure of it. We've got the hamster ranches. I can even dope them for you."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Why 
        would you want to do that?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"To 
        make it easier for you to feed on them."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No 
        need," Ching said. "Hamsters don't present us viruses with much of a problem, 
        and we enjoy a bit of a chase. Makes for health-enhancing activity."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Thank 
        God this conversation is being recorded," Jensen said. "I'm going to play 
        the tape later and laugh. Can't laugh now, though. This is too serious."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"OK, 
        it's a deal," Ching said. "When do we see the hamsters?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'll 
        have to phone the ranch," Bailey said. "I'll get back to you."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Sounds 
        good. Catch you later."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Bailey said to Jensen, "OK, you can turn off the DNA computer now."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Jensen turned a switch. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And 
        reach me the phone, will you?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You're 
        going to call your cousin at the hamster ranch?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Later. 
        First I want to tell my wife that her PH.D. is practically assured."</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        But when connected with Evelyn a few moments later, he had no chance to 
        tell his news. First he had to listen to her news that someone or something 
        called Hamster United had delivered a message to the Center. Hamster United 
        said that they had received word that humans planned to turn the West 
        Nile virus against them. This was unacceptable. Any attempt to infect 
        hamsters would call forth reprisals, not from the hamsters, who were pacific 
        enough, but from their collateral cousins and allies.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Bailey said, "Word gets around fast. What language was the message in?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"English, 
        of course. Did you think we lived in Cuba? What's going on with you, anyhow?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'll 
        tell you when you get home," Bailey said. "We've both got a lot of catching 
        up to do."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The 
        misstatement of the century," Jensen muttered under his breath. But he 
        wasn't entirely unprepared when Bailey said to him, "I wonder if there 
        are any animal groups without collateral cousins or allies."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Lungfish, 
        maybe," Jenkins said. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes, 
        but how are mosquitoes supposed to infect lungfish?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Good 
        question," Jensen said. "Let's take it up tomorrow."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Because it was already after six and Jensen had a date that night.</font></p>
