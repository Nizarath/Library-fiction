      <p align="left"><font size="3" color="black" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Juanito was on the veranda that morning, taking his morning cafe <i>con 
        leche</i> with a crisp <i>churro</i> of the sort that only old Maria could 
        make so perfectly. He saw the car when it was still far away on the highway. 
        It was Diego Melia, the village mail carrier, in his rattly old 2CV. Diego 
        turned off the highway onto the road that led between the fields of almond 
        trees, and came to a stop in front of the house. He got out, puffing slightly 
        due to his weight. He was carrying something, a package.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        two men greeted each other gravely. "I have something for you, sir," Diego 
        said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You 
        could have left it in my box," Juanito said, "and spared yourself the 
        trip."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Diego shook his head. "The gentleman from Mexico paid me to bring it to 
        you myself. Anyhow, it would not have fit in your box."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He was carrying a large flat parcel, wrapped in burlap and fastened with 
        silvery duct tape. He handed it to Juanito.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Juanito turned it over. There was no address written on it, and no return 
        address.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        is it?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Diego shrugged. "The gentleman didn't say."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        gentleman is that?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The 
        one from Mexico, to judge by his accent. He came to the post office just 
        as I was opening. Said he was passing through the region, and this gave 
        him the opportunity to return something that belonged to your family. 
        He paid me well to take it to you personally."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Diego courteously refused Juanito's offer of a coffee or a drink. "I must 
        be getting back to the post office. God be with you, Juanito."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Juanito watched until the little 2CV had left his property and turned 
        right into the highway back to the village. Then he sat down in one of 
        the straightbacked chairs and cut the duct tape with his clasp knife.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Inside he found a note. It read: </font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Dear 
        Sir,</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><font color="black">"This 
        Aztec mirror has come into my possession. I believe it is valuable, but 
        that is of no importance. The only question is, to whom does it belong? 
        My researches have determined that it rightfully belongs to you as a direct 
        descendent of that Juanito Guzman who accompanied Cortez to Mexico and 
        took part in the Conquest. Do what you want with it, keep it or destroy 
        it as you see fit. But remember, this mirror is sacred to Tezcatlipoca, 
        who no longer exists, and may never have existed."</font></i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Juanito unwrapped the burlap and took out an old Aztec mirror of polished 
        obsidian. The surface was smoky, he could barely make out his own face 
        in it. The thought occured to him that he might be well advised to have 
        nothing to do with it. The days of the Conquest were best forgotten; no 
        good could come of such a souvenir. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He looked into it anyhow. The mirror seemed to want him to look into it. 
        There was a curious attraction about it. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Then the mirror began to clear. Reflected in it Juanito saw a pyramid. 
        It was truncated, not coming to a point. A step pyramid. On its flat top 
        was a low stone altar. There was someone stretched out over the altar, 
        on his back, facing the sky. Four men were holding his arms and legs, 
        immobilizing him. They were dark, brownskinned men wearing white cotton 
        mantles. A man who seemed to be a priest was standing nearby. He was also 
        dressed in a white cotton mantle, but it was covered with feathers, and 
        they were stiff with blood. Another man, similarly attired, was holding 
        up a smoky obsidian mirror, apparently a twin of the one Juanito was looking 
        into. It seemed to be important that the mirror saw what was going on, 
        and what was to happen next. Juanito remembered reading that Tezcatlipoca, 
        the chief diety of the Aztecs, viewed events on Earth through an obsidian 
        mirror.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The priest lifted a knife--long, sharp, made of obsidian. The priest tensed, 
        preparing to driving it into the chest of the man stretched out on the 
        altar. But before he could complete the action, a shot rang out. The priest 
        screamed--more a sound of rage than of pain. His arm was shattered. The 
        obsidian knife fell from his fingers. It shattered on the stone.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        And now there were other men on the pyramid top. White men in armored 
        corselets and steel helmets, with swords of steel. They had climbed up 
        the pyramid, leaping from stone to stone. You could hear them grunt as 
        they swung heavy swords, cutting down the priests holding the sacrifice.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The sacrifice scrambled to his feet. One of the bearded strangers stooped 
        and took the mirror from the lifeless hand of the priest who had been 
        holding it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Here, 
        Juanito," he said, tossing it to the sacrifice. "A souvenir. It almost 
        witnessed your death."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The sacrifice caught the mirror. His arm sagged. The mirror was surprisingly 
        heavy.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The priest who was going to sacrifice him, bleeding to death, his arm 
        shattered, blood pouring from a sword cut between neck and shoulder, cried 
        out, "Tezcatlipoca! In your time, my lord, when you are ready."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        One of the Spaniards dispatched him with a back hand cut.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Enough 
        of this heathen mumbo jumbo," the soldier said. "It is over. Let's get 
        back to camp. Cortez will be waiting."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        They climbed painfully down the high steps of the pyramid. The plaza surrounding 
        the pyramid had been packed with people. It was empty now. The natives 
        had fled, leaving a dozen bodies when the Spanish rescue party hacked 
        through them.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        On the ground, surveying the empty plaza, one of the soldiers said, "It 
        is over."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The sacrifice said, "No, it is not over, not for me, not for Tezcatlipoca. 
        I am the sacrifice and there is no escape."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Don't 
        be a superstitious fool, Juanito," the soldier said. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The sacrifice stared into the mirror. It was clouded, dark. Juanito Guzman 
        said, "This is not the moment when Tezcatlipoca wants me. I still have 
        time..."</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Take 
        heart, my lord Guzman," the soldier said. "It is over. You will return 
        to Spain, to your estates in Asturias, to your intended, the beautiful 
        Nieves. You are a lucky man, my lord. If the mirror offends you, destroy 
        it!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No, 
        I dare not destroy it, Diego. But I have heard that Tezcatlipoca is indifferent 
        to who is sacrificed to him. Perhaps someone else..." He set the mirror 
        down carefully at the base of the pyramid.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It 
        is a pretty object, my lord. A great souvenir. If you don't want it..."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        don't! And I advise all of you to have nothing to do with it!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The soldiers muttered among themselves. It would make a lovely souvenir. 
        But they had plenty of loot back at the camp. And there was something 
        uncanny about this cloudy mirror.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Leaving the mirror behind, they made their way back to the camp...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Suddenly, compulsively, Juanito stood up from his chair. The mirror had 
        told him too much! Was there any relationship between him and his ancestor, 
        Juanito Guzman? He didn't know, didn't want to know. The dream that the 
        mirror had induced was too strange, uncanny, compelling...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        With a single compulsive he threw the damned thing against the stone wall 
        of the house--it shattered, and a single knife-shaped fragment bounced 
        back, and with uncanny accuracy pierced him to the heart. Juanito fell 
        into cloudy darkness, aware that he had taken part in an ancient sacrifice 
        long postponed, finally completed, the final sacrifice of an innocent 
        man to a cruel and impersonal god who perhaps never existed and now no 
        longer needed to exist. </font></p>
