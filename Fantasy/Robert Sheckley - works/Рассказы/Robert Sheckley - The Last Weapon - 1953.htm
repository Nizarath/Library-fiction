first science-fiction magazine was born in 1926; two years later was born a boy
baby to a quiet and previously unremarkable Brooklyn family. Young Bob Sheckley
was late getting into the science-fiction field; his first story appeared only
one year before the original publication date of this collection. But what he
lacked in promptness he made up in velocity, for at the conclusion of his first
full year of writing he had sold more than thirty stories, to almost every
major science-fiction magazine in the country and to such lesser periodicals as
Collier’s and Today’s Woman as well. We offer you . . .</span></i></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Edsel
was in a murderous mood. He, Parke, and Faxon had spent three weeks in this
part of the deadlands, breaking into every mound they came across, not finding
anything, and moving on to the next. The swift Martian summer was passing, and
each day became a little colder. Each day Edsel’s nerves, uncertain at the best
of times, had frayed a little more. Little Faxon was cheerful, dreaming of all
the money they would make when they found the weapons, and Parke plodded
silently along, apparently made of iron, not saying a word unless he was spoken
to.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>But Edsel had reached his limit.
They had broken into another mound, and again there had been no sign of the
lost Martian weapons. The watery sun seemed to be glaring at him, and the stars
were visible in an impossibly blue sky. The afternoon cold, seeped into Edsel’s
insulated suit, stiffening his joints, knotting his big muscles.</span></p>

kill Parke. He had disliked the silent man since they had formed the
partnership on Earth. He disliked him even more than he despised Faxon.</span></p>

shoulders negligently. His pale, hollow face showed no trace of expression.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Wait!” Faxon pleaded, coming up
between them. “Don’t fly off, Edsel. Just think of all the money we can make
when we find the weapons!” The little man’s eyes glowed at the thought. “They’re
right around here somewhere, Edsel. The next mound, maybe.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Edsel hesitated, glaring at
Parke. Right now he wanted to kill, more than anything else in the world. If he
had known it was like this, when they formed the company on Earth . . . It had
seemed so easy, then. He had the plaque, the one which told where a cache of
the fabulous lost Martian weapons were. Parke was able to read the Martian
script, and Faxon could finance the expedition. So, he had figured all they’d
have to do would be to land on Mars and walk up to the mound where the stuff
was hidden.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Edsel had never been off Earth
before. He hadn’t counted on the weeks of freezing, starving on concentrated
rations, always dizzy from breathing thin, tired air circulating through a
replenisher. He hadn’t thought about the sore, aching muscles you get, dragging
your way through the thick Martian brush.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

price a government— any government—would pay for those legendary weapons.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“I’m sorry,” Edsel said, making
up his mind suddenly. “This place gets me. Sorry I blew up, Parke. Lead on.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Parke nodded, and started again.
Faxon breathed a sigh of relief, and followed Parke.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>They
found the correct mound in mid-afternoon, just as Edsel’s patience was wearing
thin again. It was a strange, massive affair, just as the script had said. Under
a few inches of dirt was metal. The men scraped and found a door.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Here, I’ll blast it open,” Edsel
said, drawing his revolver. Parke pushed him aside, turned the handle and
opened the door.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Inside was a tremendous room. And
there, row upon gleaming row, were the legendary lost weapons of Mars, the
missing artifacts of Martian civilization.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The three men stood for a moment,
just looking. Here was the treasure that men had almost given up looking for.
Since man had landed on Mars, the ruins of great cities had been explored.
Scattered across the plains were ruined vehicles, artforms, tools, everything
indicating the ghost of a titanic civilization, a thousand years beyond Earth’s.
Patiently deciphered scripts had told of the great wars ravaging the surface of
Mars. The scripts stopped too soon, though, because nothing told what had
happened to the Martians. There hadn’t been an intelligent being on Mars for
several thousand years. Somehow, all animal life on the planet had been
obliterated.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>And, apparently, the Martians had
taken their weapons with them.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>These lost weapons, Edsel knew,
were worth their weight in radium. There just wasn’t anything like them.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The men went inside. Edsel picked
up the first thing his hand reached. It looked like a .45, only bigger. He went
to the door and pointed the weapon at a shrub on the plain.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Don’t fire it,” Faxon said, as
Edsel took aim. “It might backfire or something. Let the government men fire
them, after we sell.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Edsel squeezed the trigger. The
shrub, seventy-five feet away, erupted in a bright red flash.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Not bad,” Edsel said, patting
the gun. He put it down and reached for another.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Please, Edsel,” Faxon said,
squinting nervously at him. “There’s no need to try them out. You might set off
an atomic bomb or something.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Shut up,” Edsel said, examining
the weapon for a firing stud.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Don’t shoot any more,” Faxon
pleaded. He looked to Parke for support, but the silent man was watching Edsel.
“You know, something in this place might have been responsible for the
destruction of the Martian race. You wouldn’t want to set it off again, would
you?”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Edsel watched a spot on the plain
glow with heat as he fired at it.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Good stuff.” He picked up
another, rod-shaped instrument. The cold was forgotten. Edsel was perfectly
happy now, playing with all the shiny things.</span></p>

moving toward the door.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Started? Where?” Edsel demanded.
He picked up another glittering weapon, curved to fit his wrist and hand.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Back to the port,” Faxon said. “Back
to sell this stuff, like we planned. I figure we can ask just about any price,
any price at all. A government would give billions for weapons like these.”</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“I’ve changed my mind,” Edsel
said. Out of the corner of his eye he was watching Parke. The slender man was
walking between the stacks of weapons, but so far he hadn’t touched any.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“To hell with selling it,” Edsel
said, leaning against the cave wall where he could also watch Parke. “I figure
I can use this stuff myself.” He grinned broadly, still watching both men.</span></p>

had a wonderful half hour, running back and forth to the door with different
weapons. Parke made no move to touch anything, but watched with interest. The
ancient Martian arms were as good as new, apparently unaffected by their
thousands of years of disuse. There were many blasting weapons, of various
designs and capabilities. Then heat and radiation guns, marvelously compact
things. There were weapons which would freeze, and weapons which would burn;
others which would crumble, cut, coagulate, paralyze, and any of the other ways
of snuffing out life.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“What an idiot,” Parke told
himself, slipping the helmet on his head. “A kingdom! All the power in the
world, and he dreamed of a little kingdom!”. He glanced back at the cave.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“With those troops—the
force-field—and the weapons— I can take over the world.” He said it coldly,
knowing it was a fact. He turned to go back to the cave, to activate the
Synthetics, but stopped first to pick up the little black box Edsel had
carried.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Engraved on it, in flowing
Martian script, was, “The Last Weapon.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>I wonder what it could be, Parke
asked himself. He had let Edsel live long enough to try out all the others; no
use chancing a misfire himself. It was too bad he hadn’t lived long enough to
try out this one, too.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Of course, I really don’t need it,
he told himself. He had plenty. But this might make the job a lot easier, a lot
safer. Whatever it was, it was bound to be good.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Well, he told himself, let’s see
what the Martians considered their last weapon. He opened the box.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>A vapor drifted out, and Parke
threw the box from him, thinking about poison gas.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The vapor mounted, drifted
haphazardly for a while, then began to coalesce. It spread, grew, and took
shape.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>In a few seconds, it was
complete, hovering over the box. It glimmered white in the dying light, and
Parke saw that it was just a tremendous mouth, topped by a pair of unblinking
eyes.</span></p>

It drifted to the body of Edsel. Parke lifted a blaster and took careful aim.</span></p>

nuzzling Edsel’s body. “I<i> like</i> quiet protoplasm.” It took down the body
in a single gulp.</span></p>

hole in the ground. The giant mouth drifted out of it, chuckling.</span></p>

a forged grip. He refused to let himself become panicked. Calmly he activated
the force-field, forming a blue sphere around himself.</span></p>
