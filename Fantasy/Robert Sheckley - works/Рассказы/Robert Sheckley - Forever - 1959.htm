<h1><big>FOREVER</big></h1>

<h2><small>By NED LANG</small></h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><i><big><b>Of all the irksome, frustrating,
maddening discoveries&mdash;was there
no way of keeping it discovered?</b></big></i></p></div>

<p class="hd1"><big><b>Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS</b></big></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">With</span> so much at stake,
Charles Dennison should
not have been careless.
An inventor cannot afford carelessness,
particularly when his invention
is extremely valuable and
obviously patentable. There are
too many grasping hands ready to
seize what belongs to someone
else, too many men who feast upon
the creativity of the innocent.</p>

<p>A touch of paranoia would have
served Dennison well; but he was
lacking in that vital characteristic
of inventors. And he didn't even
realize the full extent of his carelessness
until a bullet, fired from
a silenced weapon, chipped a
granite wall not three inches from
his head.</p>

<p>Then he knew. But by then it
was too late.</p>

<p>Charles Dennison had been left
a more than adequate income by
his father. He had gone to Harvard,
served a hitch in the Navy,
then continued his education at
M.I.T. Since the age of thirty-two,
he had been engaged in
private research, working in his
own small laboratory in Riverdale,
New York. Plant biology was
his field. He published several
noteworthy papers, and sold a new
insecticide to a development corporation.
The royalties helped him
to expand his facilities.</p>

<p>Dennison enjoyed working
alone. It suited his temperament,
which was austere but not unfriendly.
Two or three times a
year, he would come to New York,
see some plays and movies, and
do a little serious drinking. He
would then return gratefully to his
seclusion. He was a bachelor and
seemed destined to remain that
way.</p>

<p>Not long after his fortieth birthday,
Dennison stumbled across an
intriguing clue which led him into
a different branch of biology. He
pursued his clue, developed it,
extended it slowly into a hypothesis.
After three more years, a
lucky accident put the final proofs
into his hands.</p>

<p>He had invented a most effective
longevity drug. It was not
proof against violence; aside from
that, however, it could fairly be
called an immortality serum.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Now</span> was the time for caution.
But years of seclusion had
made Dennison unwary of people
and their motives. He was more or
less heedless of the world around
him; it never occurred to him that
the world was not equally heedless
of him.</p>

<p>He thought only about his
serum. It was valuable and patentable.
But was it the sort of thing
that should be revealed? Was the
world ready for an immortality
drug?</p>

<p>He had never enjoyed speculation
of this sort. But since the
atom bomb, many scientists had
been forced to look at the ethics
of their profession. Dennison
looked at his and decided that
immortality was inevitable.</p>

<p>Mankind had, throughout its
existence, poked and probed into
the recesses of nature, trying to
figure out how things worked. If
one man didn't discover fire, or
the use of the lever, or gunpowder,
or the atom bomb, or immortality,
another would. Man willed to
know all nature's secrets, and there
was no way of keeping them
hidden.</p>

<p>Armed with this bleak but
comforting philosophy, Dennison
packed his formulas and proofs
into a briefcase, slipped a two-ounce
bottle of the product into a
jacket pocket, and left his Riverdale
laboratory. It was already
evening. He planned to spend the
night in a good midtown hotel,
see a movie, and proceed to the
Patent Office in Washington the
following day.</p>

<p>On the subway, Dennison was
absorbed in a newspaper. He was
barely conscious of the men sitting
on either side of him. He became
aware of them only when the man
on his right poked him firmly in
the ribs.</p>

<p>Dennison glanced over and saw
the snub nose of a small automatic,
concealed from the rest of
the car by a newspaper, resting
against his side.</p>

<p>"What is this?" Dennison asked.</p>

<p>"Hand it over," the man said.</p>

<p>Dennison was stunned. How
could anyone have known about
his discovery? And how could they
dare try to rob him in a public
subway car?</p>

<p>Then he realized that they were
probably just after his money.</p>

<p>"I don't have much on me,"
Dennison said hoarsely, reaching
for his wallet.</p>

<p>The man on his left leaned over
and slapped the briefcase. "Not
money," he said. "The immortality
stuff."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> some unaccountable fashion,
they knew. What if he refused
to give up his briefcase? Would
they dare fire the automatic in
the subway? It was a very small
caliber weapon. Its noise might
not even be heard above the subway's
roar. And probably they felt
justified in taking the risk for a
prize as great as the one Dennison
carried.</p>

<p>He looked at them quickly.
They were mild-looking men,
quietly, almost somberly dressed.
Something about their clothing
jogged Dennison's memory unpleasantly,
but he didn't have time
to place the recollection. The automatic
was digging painfully into
his ribs.</p>

<p>The subway was coming to a
station. Dennison glanced at the
man on his left and caught the
glint of light on a tiny hypodermic.</p>

<p>Many inventors, involved only
in their own thoughts, are slow
of reaction. But Dennison had
been a gunnery officer in the Navy
and had seen his share of action.
He was damned if he was going to
give up his invention so easily.</p>

<p>He jumped from his seat and
the hypo passed through the sleeve
of his coat, just missing his arm.
He swung the briefcase at the
man with the automatic, catching
him across the forehead with the
metal edge. As the doors opened,
he ran past a popeyed subway
guard, up the stairs and into the
street.</p>

<p>The two men followed, one of
them streaming blood from his
forehead. Dennison ran, looking
wildly around for a policeman.</p>

<p>The men behind him were
screaming, "Stop, thief! Police!
Police! Stop that man!"</p>

<p>Apparently they were also prepared
to face the police and to
claim the briefcase and bottle as
their own. Ridiculous! Yet the
complete and indignant confidence
in their shrill voices unnerved
Dennison. He hated a scene.</p>

<p>Still, a policeman would be best.
The briefcase was filled with proof
of who he was. Even his name was
initialed on the outside of the briefcase.
One glance would tell anyone ...</p>

<p>He caught a flash of metal from
his briefcase, and, still running,
looked at it. He was shocked to
see a metal plate fixed to the cowhide,
over the place where his
initials had been. The man on his
left must have done that when he
slapped the briefcase.</p>

<p>Dennison dug at the plate with
his fingertips, but it would not
come off.</p>

<p>It read, <i>Property of Edward
James Flaherty, Smithfield Institute</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a policeman wouldn't
be so much help, after all.</p>

<p>But the problem was academic,
for Dennison saw no policeman
along the crowded Bronx street.
People stood aside as he ran past,
staring open-mouthed, offering
neither assistance nor interference.
But the men behind him were
still screaming, "Stop the thief!
Stop the thief!"</p>

<p>The entire long block was
alerted. The people, like some
sluggish beast goaded reluctantly
into action, began to make tentative
movements toward Dennison,
impelled by the outraged cries of
his pursuers.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Unless</span> he balanced the scales
of public opinion, some do-gooder
was going to interfere
soon. Dennison conquered his shyness
and pride, and called out,
"Help me! They're trying to rob
me! Stop them!"</p>

<p>But his voice lacked the moral
indignation, the absolute conviction
of his two shrill-voiced pursuers.
A burly young man stepped
forward to block Dennison's way,
but at the last moment a woman
pulled him back.</p>

<p>"Don't get into trouble, Charley."</p>

<p>"Why don't someone call a
cop?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, where are the cops?"</p>

<p>"Over at a big fire on 178th
Street, I hear."</p>

<p>"We oughta stop that guy."</p>

<p>"I'm willing if you're willing."</p>

<p>Dennison's way was suddenly
blocked by four grinning youths,
teen-agers in black motorcycle
jackets and boots, excited by the
chance for a little action, delighted
at the opportunity to hit someone
in the name of law and order.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="372" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Dennison saw them, swerved
suddenly and sprinted across the
street. A bus loomed in front of
him.</p>

<p>He hurled himself out of its
way, fell, got up again and ran on.</p>

<p>His pursuers were delayed by
the dense flow of traffic. Their
high-pitched cries faded as Dennison
turned into a side street, ran
down its length, then down another.</p>

<p>He was in a section of massive
apartment buildings. His lungs felt
like a blast furnace and his left
side seemed to be sewed together
with red-hot wire. There was no
help for it, he had to rest.</p>

<p>It was then that the first bullet,
fired from a silenced weapon,
chipped a granite wall not three
inches from his head. That was
when Dennison realized the full
extent of his carelessness.</p>

<p>He pulled the bottle out of his
pocket. He had hoped to carry out
more experiments on the serum
before trying it on human beings.
Now there was no choice.</p>

<p>Dennison yanked out the stopper
and drained the contents.</p>

<p>Immediately he was running
again, as a second bullet scored
the granite wall. The great blocks
of apartments loomed endlessly
ahead of him, silent and alien.
There were no walkers upon the
streets. There was only Dennison,
running more slowly now past the
immense, blank-faced apartments.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;long</span> black car came up
behind him, its searchlight
probing into doors and alleys. Was
it the police?</p>

<p>"That's him!" cried the shrill,
unnerving voice of one of Dennison's
pursuers.</p>

<p>Dennison ducked into a narrow
alley between buildings, raced
down it and into the next street.</p>

<p>There were two cars on that
street, at either end of the block,
their headlights shining toward
each other, moving slowly to trap
him in the middle. The alley
gleamed with light now, from the
first car's headlights shining down
it. He was surrounded.</p>

<p>Dennison raced to the nearest
apartment building and yanked at
the door. It was locked. The two
cars were almost even with him.
And, looking at them, Dennison remembered
the unpleasant jog his
memory had given him earlier.</p>

<p>The two cars were hearses.</p>

<p>The men in the subway, with
their solemn faces, solemn clothing,
subdued neckties, shrill, indignant
voices&mdash;they had reminded
him of undertakers. They
<i>had</i> been undertakers!</p>

<p>Of course! Of course! Oil companies
might want to block the invention
of a cheap new fuel which
could put them out of business;
steel corporations might try to
stop the development of an
inexpensive, stronger-than-steel
plastic ...</p>

<p>And the production of an immortality
serum would put the undertakers
out of business.</p>

<p>His progress, and the progress
of thousands of other researchers
in biology, must have been
watched. And when he made his
discovery, they had been ready.</p>

<p>The hearses stopped, and somber-faced,
respectable-looking men
in black suits and pearl-gray neckties
poured out and seized him.
The briefcase was yanked out of
his hand. He felt the prick of a
needle in his shoulder. Then, with
no transitional dizziness, he passed
out.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> came to sitting in an armchair.
There were armed men
on either side of him. In front of
him stood a small, plump, undistinguished-looking
man in sedate
clothing.</p>

<p>"My name is Mr. Bennet," the
plump man said. "I wish to beg
your forgiveness, Mr. Dennison,
for the violence to which you were
subjected. We found out about
your invention only at the last
moment and therefore had to improvise.
The bullets were meant
only to frighten and delay you.
Murder was not our intention."</p>

<p>"You merely wanted to steal
my discovery," Dennison said.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Mr. Bennet told
him. "The secret of immortality
has been in our possession for
quite some time."</p>

<p>"I see. Then you want to keep
immortality from the public in
order to safeguard your damned
undertaking business!"</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather a naive view?"
Mr. Bennet asked, smiling. "As it
happens, my associates and I are
<i>not</i> undertakers. We took on the
disguise in order to present an understandable
motive if our plan to
capture you had misfired. In that
event, others would have believed
exactly&mdash;and only&mdash;what you
thought: that our purpose was to
safeguard our business."</p>

<p>Dennison frowned and watchfully
waited.</p>

<p>"Disguises come easily to us,"
Mr. Bennet said, still smiling. "Perhaps
you have heard rumors about
a new carburetor suppressed by
the gasoline companies, or a new
food source concealed by the great
food suppliers, or a new synthetic
hastily destroyed by the cotton-owning
interests. That was us.
And the inventions ended up here."</p>

<p>"You're trying to impress me,"
Dennison said.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Why did you stop me from
patenting my immortality serum?"</p>

<p>"The world is not ready for it
yet," said Mr. Bennet.</p>

<p>"It isn't ready for a lot of
things," Dennison said. "Why
didn't you block the atom bomb?"</p>

<p>"We tried, disguised as mercenary
coal and oil interests. But
we failed. However, we have succeeded
with a surprising number
of things."</p>

<p>"But what's the purpose behind
it all?"</p>

<p>"Earth's welfare," Mr. Bennet
said promptly. "Consider what
would happen if the people were
given your veritable immortality
serum. The problems of birth rate,
food production, living space all
would be aggravated. Tensions
would mount, war would be imminent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So what?" Dennison challenged.
"That's how things are
right now, <i>without</i> immortality.
Besides, there have been cries of
doom about every new invention
or discovery. Gunpowder, the
printing press, nitroglycerin, the
atom bomb, they were all supposed
to destroy the race. But
mankind has learned how to
handle them. It had to! You can't
turn back the clock, and you can't
un-discover something. If it's there,
mankind must deal with it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a bumbling, bloody, inefficient
fashion," said Mr. Bennet,
with an expression of distaste.</p>

<p>"Well, that's how Man is."</p>

<p>"Not if he's properly led," Mr.
Bennet said.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Certainly</span> not," said Mr.
Bennet. "You see, the immortality
serum provides a solution
to the problem of political
power. Rule by a permanent and
enlightened elite is by far the best
form of government; infinitely better
than the blundering inefficiencies
of democratic rule. But
throughout history, this elite,
whether monarchy, oligarchy, dictatorship
or junta, has been unable
to perpetuate itself. Leaders
die, the followers squabble for
power, and chaos is close behind.
With immortality, this last flaw
would be corrected. There would
be no discontinuity of leadership,
for the leaders would always be
there."</p>

<p>"A permanent dictatorship,"
Dennison said.</p>

<p>"Yes. A permanent, benevolent
rule by small, carefully chosen
elite corps, based upon the sole
and exclusive possession of immortality.
It's historically inevitable.
The only question is, who is
going to get control first?"</p>

<p>"And you think you are?" Dennison
demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course. Our organization is
still small, but absolutely solid. It
is bolstered by every new invention
that comes into our hands and
by every scientist who joins our
ranks. Our time will come, Dennison!
We'd like to have you with
us, among the elite."</p>

<p>"You want <i>me</i> to join you?"
Dennison asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"We do. Our organization needs
creative scientific minds to help us
in our work, to help us save mankind
from itself."</p>

<p>"Count me out," Dennison said,
his heart beating fast.</p>

<p>"You won't join us?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you all hanged."</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet nodded thoughtfully
and pursed his small lips. "You
have taken your own serum, have
you not?"</p>

<p>Dennison nodded. "I suppose
that means you kill me now?"</p>

<p>"We don't kill," Mr. Bennet
said. "We merely wait. I think you
are a reasonable man, and I think
you'll come to see things our way.
We'll be around a long time. So
will you. Take him away."</p>

<p>Dennison was led to an elevator
that dropped deep into the Earth.
He was marched down a long passageway
lined with armed men.
They went through four massive
doors. At the fifth, Dennison was
pushed inside alone, and the door
was locked behind him.</p>

<p>He was in a large, well-furnished
apartment. There were perhaps
twenty people in the room,
and they came forward to meet
him.</p>

<p>One of them, a stocky, bearded
man, was an old college acquaintance
of Dennison's.</p>

<p>"Jim Ferris?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Ferris said. "Welcome
to the Immortality Club,
Dennison."</p>

<p>"I read you were killed in an
air crash last year."</p>

<p>"I merely&mdash;disappeared," Ferris
said, with a rueful smile, "after inventing
the immortality serum.
Just like the others."</p>

<p>"All of them?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen of the men here invented
the serum independently.
The rest are successful inventors
in other fields. Our oldest member
is Doctor Li, a serum discoverer,
who disappeared from San
Francisco in 1911. You are our
latest acquisition. Our clubhouse
is probably the most carefully
guarded place on Earth."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dennison</span> said, "Nineteen-eleven!"
Despair flooded him
and he sat down heavily in a
chair. "Then there's no possibility
of rescue?"</p>

<p>"None. There are only four
choices available to us," Ferris
said. "Some have left us and joined
the Undertakers. Others have suicided.
A few have gone insane.
The rest of us have formed the
Immortality Club."</p>

<p>"What for?" Dennison bewilderedly
asked.</p>

<p>"To get out of this place!" said
Ferris. "To escape and give our
discoveries to the world. To stop
those hopeful little dictators upstairs."</p>

<p>"They must know what you're
planning."</p>

<p>"Of course. But they let us live
because, every so often, one of us
gives up and joins them. And they
don't think we can ever break
out. They're much too smug. It's
the basic defect of all power-elites,
and their eventual undoing."</p>

<p>"You said this was the most
closely guarded place on Earth?"</p>

<p>"It is," Ferris said.</p>

<p>"And some of you have been
trying to break out for fifty years?
Why, it'll take forever to escape!"</p>

<p>"Forever is exactly how long
we have," said Ferris. "But we
hope it won't take quite that long.
Every new man brings new ideas,
plans. One of them is bound to
work."</p>

<p>"<i>Forever</i>," Dennison said, his
face buried in his hands.</p>

<p>"You can go back upstairs and
join them," Ferris said, with a
hard note to his voice, "or you can
suicide, or just sit in a corner and
go quietly mad. Take your pick."</p>

<p>Dennison looked up. "I must be
honest with you and with myself.
I don't think we can escape. Furthermore,
I don't think any of you
really believe we can."</p>

<p>Ferris shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Aside from that," Dennison
said, "I think it's a damned good
idea. If you'll bring me up to date,
I'll contribute whatever I can to
the Forever Project. And let's
hope their complacency lasts."</p>

<p>"It will," Ferris said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> escape did not take forever,
of course. In one hundred
and thirty-seven years, Dennison
and his colleagues made their successful
breakout and revealed the
Undertakers' Plot. The Undertakers
were tried before the High
Court on charges of kidnapping,
conspiracy to overthrow the government,
and illegal possession of
immortality. They were found
guilty on all counts and summarily
executed.</p>

<p>Dennison and his colleagues
were also in illegal possession of
immortality, which is the privilege
only of our governmental elite.
But the death penalty was waived
in view of the Immortality Club's
service to the State.</p>

<p>This mercy was premature,
however. After some months the
members of the Immortality Club
went into hiding, with the avowed
purpose of overthrowing the Elite
Rule and disseminating immortality
among the masses. Project
Forever, as they termed it, has
received some support from dissidents,
who have not yet been apprehended.
It cannot be considered
a serious threat.</p>

<p>But this deviationist action in
no way detracts from the glory of
the Club's escape from the Undertakers.
The ingenious way in which
Dennison and his colleagues broke
out of their seemingly impregnable
prison, using only a steel belt
buckle, a tungsten filament, three
hens' eggs, and twelve chemicals
that can be readily obtained from
the human body, is too well known
to be repeated here.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
