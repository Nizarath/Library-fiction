<A name=1></a><b>THE STORE OF THE WORLDS</b><br>
by<br>
<b>Robert Sheckley</b><br>
Mr. Wayne came to the end of the long, shoulder-high mound of grey rubble, and there was the Store of the Worlds. <br>It was exactly as his friends had described: a small shack constructed of bits of lumber, parts of cars, a piece of<br>galvanised iron and a few rows of crumbling bricks, all daubed over with a watery blue paint.<br>
Mr. Wayne glanced back down the long lane of rubble to make sure he hadn’t been followed.  He tucked his parcel<br>
more firmly under his arm; then, with a little shiver at his own audacity, he opened the door and slipped inside.<br>
“Good morning,” the proprietor said.<br>He, too, was exactly as described: a tall, crafty-looking old fellow with narrow eyes and a downcast mouth.  His<br>
name was Tompkins.  He sat in an old rocking chair, and perched on the back of it was a blue and green parrot.  There<br>was one other chair in the store, and a table.  One the table was a rusted hypodermic.<br>
“I’ve heard about your store from friends,” Mr. Wayne said.<br>“Then you know my price,” Tompkins said.  “Have you brought it?”<br>“Yes,” said Mr. Wayne, holding up his parcel.  “But I want to ask first –”<br>“They always want to ask,” Tompkins said to the parrot, who blinked.  “Go ahead, ask.”<br>“I want to know what really happens.”<br>Tompkins sighed.  “What happens is this.  You pay me my fee.  I give you an injection which knocks you out. <br>
Then, with the aid of certain gadgets which I have in the back of the store, I liberate your mind.”<br>
Tompkins smiled as he said that, and his silent parrot seemed to smile, too.<br>“What happens then?” Mr. Wayne asked.<br>“Your mind, liberated from its body, is able to choose from the countless probability-worlds which the Earth casts<br>
off in every second of its existence.”<br>
Grinning now, Tompkins sat up in his rocking chair and began to show signs of enthusiasm.<br>“Yes, my friend, though you might not have suspected it, from the moment this battered Earth was born out of the<br>
sun’s fiery womb, it cast off its alternate-probability worlds.  Worlds without end, emanating from events large and<br>small; every Alexander and every amoeba creating worlds, just as ripples will spread in a pond no matter how big or<br>how small the stone you throw.  Doesn’t every object cast a shadow?  Well, my friend, the Earth itself is<br>four-dimensional; therefore it casts three-dimensional shadows, solid reflections of itself through every moment of its<br>being.  Millions, billions of Earths!  An infinity of Earths!  And your mind, liberated by me, will be able to select any of<br>these worlds, and to live upon it for a while.”<br>
Mr. Wayne was uncomfortably aware that Tompkins sounded like a circus barker, proclaiming marvels that simply<br>
couldn’t exist.  But, Mr. Wayne reminded himself, things had happened within his own lifetime which he would never<br>have believed possible.  Never!  So perhaps the wonders that Tompkins spoke of were possible, too.<br>
Mr. Wayne said, “My friends also told me –”<br>“That I was an out-and-out fraud?” Tompkins asked.<br>“Some of them <i>implied</i> that,” Mr. Wayne said cautiously.  “But I try to keep an open mind.  They also said –”<br>“I know what your dirty-minded friends said.  They told you about the fulfilment of desire.  Is that what you want<br>
to hear about?”<br>
“Yes,” said Mr. Wayne.  “They told me that whatever I wished for – whatever I wanted –”<br>“Exactly,” Tompkins said.  “The thing could work in no other way.  There are the infinite worlds to choose among. <br>
Your mind chooses, and is guided only by desire.  Your deepest desire is the only thing that counts.  If you have been<br>harbouring a secret dream of murder –”<br>
“Oh hardly, hardly!” cried Mr. Wayne.<br>“– then you will go to a world where you <i>can</i> murder, where you can roll in blood, where you can outdo de Sade or<br>
Caesar, or whoever your idol may be.  Suppose it’s power you want?  Then you’ll choose a world where you are a god,<br>literally and actually.  A bloodthirsty Juggernaut, perhaps, or an all-wise Buddha.”<br>
“I doubt very much if I –”<br>“There are other desires, too,” Tompkins said.  “All heavens and all hells.  Unbridled sexuality.  Gluttony,<br>
drunkenness, love, fame – anything you want.”<br>
“Amazing!” said Mr. Wayne.<br>“Yes,” Tompkins agreed.  “Of course, my little list doesn’t exhaust all the possibilities, all the combinations and<br>
permutations of desire.  For all I know you might want a simple, placid, pastoral existence on a South Sea island among<br>idealised natives.”<br>
“That sounds more like me,” Mr. Wayne said, with a shy laugh.<br>“But who knows?” Tompkins asked.  “Even you might not know what your true desires are.  They might involve<br>
your own death.”<br>
<hr>
<A name=2></a>“Does that happen often?” Mr. Wayne asked anxiously.<br>“Occasionally.”<br>“I wouldn’t want to die,” Mr. Wayne said.<br>“It hardly ever happens,” Tompkins said, looking at the parcel in Mr. Wayne’s hands.<br>“If you say so …  But how do I know all this is real?  Your fee is extremely high, it’ll take everything I own.  And for<br>
all I know, you’ll give me a drug and I’ll just <i>dream!</i>  Everything I own just for a – a shot of heroin and a lot of fancy<br>words!”<br>
Tompkins smiled reassuringly.  “The experience has no drug-like quality about it.  And no sensation of a dream,<br>
either.”<br>
“If it’s <i>true</i>,” Mr. Wayne said, a little petulantly, “why can’t I stay in the world of my desire for good?”<br>“I’m working on that,” Tompkins said.  “That’s why I charge so high a fee; to get materials, to experiment.  I’m<br>
trying to find a way of making the transition permanent.  So far I haven’t been able to loosen the cord that binds a man<br>to his own Earth – and pulls him back to it.  Not even the great mystics could cut that cord, except with death.  But I<br>still have my hopes.”<br>
“It would be a great thing if you succeeded,” Mr. Wayne said politely.<br>“Yes it would!” Tompkins cried, with a surprising burst of passion.  “For then I’d turn my wretched shop into an<br>
escape hatch!  My process would be free then, free for everyone!  Everyone would go to the Earth of their desires, the<br>Earth that really suited them, and leave <i>this</i> damned place to the rats and worms –”<br>
Tompkins cut himself off in mid-sentence, and became icy calm.  “But I fear my prejudices are showing.  I can’t<br>
offer a permanent escape from the Earth yet; not one that doesn’t involve death.  Perhaps I never will be able to.  For<br>now, all I can offer you is a vacation, a change, a taste of another world, and a look at your own desires.  You know my<br>fee.  I’ll refund it if the experience isn’t satisfactory.”<br>
“That’s good of you,” Mr. Wayne said, quite earnestly.  “But there’s that other matter my friends told me about. <br>
The ten years off my life.”<br>
“That can’t be helped,” Tompkins said, “and can’t be refunded.  My process is a tremendous strain on the nervous<br>
system, and life-expectancy is shortened accordingly.  That’s one of the reasons why our so-called government has<br>declared my process illegal.”<br>
“But they don’t enforce the ban very firmly,” Mr. Wayne said.<br>“No.  Officially the process is banned as a harmful fraud.  But officials are men, too.  They’d like to leave this Earth,<br>
just like everyone else.”<br>
“The cost,” Mr. Wayne mused, gripping his parcel tightly.  “And ten years off my life!  For the fulfilment of my<br>
secret desires …  Really, I must give this some thought.”<br>
“Think away,” Tompkins said indifferently.<br>All the way home Mr. Wayne thought about it.  When his train reached Port Washington, Long Island, he was still<br>
thinking.  And driving his car from the station to his home he was still thinking about Tompkins’s crafty old face, and<br>worlds of probability, and the fulfilment of desire.<br>
But when he stepped inside his house, those thoughts had to stop.  Janet, his wife, wanted him to speak sharply to<br>
the maid, who had been drinking again.  His son Tommy wanted to help with the sloop, which was to be launched<br>tomorrow.  And his baby daughter wanted to tell him about her day in kindergarten.<br>
Mr. Wayne spoke pleasantly but firmly to the maid.  He helped Tommy put the final coat of copper paint on the<br>
sloop’s bottom and he listened to Peggy tell about her adventures in the playground.<br>
Later, when the children were in bed and he and Janet were alone in their living room, she asked him if something<br>
were wrong.<br>
“Wrong?”<br>“You seem to be worried about something,” Janet said.  “Did you have a bad day at the office?”<br>“Oh, just the usual sort of thing …”<br>He certainly was not going to tell Janet, or anyone else, that he had taken the day off and gone to see Tompkins in<br>
his crazy old Store of the Worlds.  Now was he going to speak about the right every man should have, once in his<br>life-time, to fulfil his most secret desires.  Janet, with her good common sense, would never understand that.<br>
The next days at the office were extremely hectic.  All of Wall Street was in a mild panic over events in the Middle<br>
East and in Asia, and stocks were reacting accordingly.  Mr. Wayne settled down to work.  He tried not to think of the<br>fulfilment of desire at the cost of everything he possessed, with ten years of his life thrown in for good measure.  It<br>was crazy!  Old Tompkins must be insane!<br>
On weekends he went sailing with Tommy.  The old sloop was behaving very well, making practically no water<br>
through her bottom seams.  Tommy wanted a new set of racing sails, but Mr. Wayne sternly rejected that.  Perhaps<br>next year, if the market looked better.  For now, the old sails would have to do.<br>
Sometimes at night, after the children were asleep, he and Janet would go sailing.  Long Island Sound was quiet<br>
then, and cool.  Their boat glided past the blinking buoys, sailing toward the swollen yellow moon.<br>
“I <i>know </i> something’s on your mind,” Janet said.<br>“Darling, please!”<br>“Is there something you’re keeping from me?”<br>“Nothing!”<br>“Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure?”<br>“Absolutely sure.”<br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>“Then put your arms around me.  That’s right …”<br>And the sloop sailed itself for a while.<br>Desire and fulfilment …  But autumn came, and the sloop had to be hauled.  The stock market regained some<br>
stability, but Peggy caught the measles.  Tommy wanted to know the differences between ordinary bombs, atom<br>bombs, hydrogen bombs, cobalt bombs, and all the other kinds of bombs that were in the news.  Mr. Wayne explained<br>to the best of his ability.  And the maid quit unexpectedly.<br>
Secret desires were all very well.  Perhaps he <i>did</i> want to kill someone, or live on a South Sea island.  But there were<br>
responsibilities to consider.  He had two growing children, and a better wife than he deserved.<br>
Perhaps around Christmas time …<br>But in mid-winter there was a fire in the unoccupied guest bedroom due to defective wiring.  The firemen put out<br>
the blaze without much damage, and no one was hurt.  But it put any thought of Tompkins out of his mind for a while. <br>First the bedroom had to be repaired, for Mr. Wayne was very proud of his gracious old house.<br>
Business was still frantic and uncertain due to the international situation.  Those Russians, those Arabs, those<br>
Greeks, those Chinese.  The intercontinental missiles, the atom bombs, the sputniks …  Mr. Wayne spent long days at<br>the office, and sometimes evenings, too.  Tommy caught the mumps.  A part of the roof had to be re-shingled.  And<br>then already it was time to consider the spring launching of the sloop.<br>
A year had passed, and he’d had very little time to think of secret desires.  But perhaps next year.  In the meantime<br>
–<br>
“Well?” said Tompkins.  “Are you all right?”<br>“Yes, quite all right,” Mr. Wayne said.  He got up from the chair and rubbed his forehead.<br>“Do you want a refund?” Tompkins asked.<br>“No.  The experience was quite satisfactory.”<br>“They always are,” Tompkins said, winking lewdly at the parrot.  “Well, what was yours?”<br>“A world of the recent past,” Mr. Wayne said.<br>“A lot of them are.  Did you find out about your secret desire?  Was it murder?  Or a South Sea island?”<br>“I’d rather not discuss it,” Mr. Wayne said, pleasantly but firmly.<br>“A lot of people won’t discuss it with me,” Tompkins said sulkily.  “I’ll be damned if I know why.”<br>“Because – well, I think the world of one’s secret desires feels sacred, somehow.  No offence …  Do you think<br>
you’ll ever be able to make it permanent?  The world of one’s choice, I mean?”<br>
The old man shrugged his shoulders.  “I’m trying.  If I succeed, you’ll hear about it.  Everyone will.”<br>“Yes, I suppose so.”  Mr. Wayne undid his parcel and laid its contents on the table.  The parcel contained a pair of<br>
army boots, a knife, two coils of copper wire and three small cans of corned beef.<br>
Tompkins’s eyes glittered for a moment.  “Quite satisfactory,” he said.  “Thank you.”<br>“Goodbye,” said Mr. Wayne.  “And thank <i>you</i>.”<br>
Mr. Wayne left the shop and hurried down to the end of the lane of grey rubble.  Beyond it, as far as he could see,<br>
lay flat fields of rubble, brown and grey and black.  Those fields, stretching to every horizon, were made of the twisted<br>corpses of cities, the shattered remnants of trees and the fine white ash that once was human flesh and bone.<br>
“Well,” Mr. Wayne said to himself, “at least we gave as good as we got.”<br>That year in the past had cost him everything he owned, and ten years of life thrown in for good measure.  Had it<br>
been a dream?  It was still worth it!  But now he had to put away all thought of Janet and the children.  That was<br>finished, unless Tompkins perfected his process.  Now he had to think about his own survival.<br>
With the aid of his wrist geiger he found a deactivated lane through the rubble.  He’d better get back to the shelter<br>
before dark, before the rats came out.  If he didn’t hurry he’d miss the evening potato ration.<br>
