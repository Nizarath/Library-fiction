<h1>The Seventh Victim</h1>
<h2>by Robert Sheckley</h2>

<hr>
<p>STANTON FRELAINE sat at his desk, trying to look as busy as an
executive should at nine-thirty in the morning. It was
impossible. He couldn&#8217;t concentrate on the advertisement he had
written the previous night, couldn&#8217;t think about business. All he
could do was wait until the mail came.</p>
<p>He had been expecting his notification for two
weeks now. The government was behind schedule, as usual.</p>
<p>The glass door of his office was marked Morger
and Frelaine, Clothiers.</p>
<p>It opened, and E. J. Morger walked in, limping
slightly from his old gunshot wound. His shoulders were bent; but
at the age of seventy-three, he wasn&#8217;t worrying much about his posture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Stan?&#8221; Morger asked. &#8220;What
about that ad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Frelaine had joined Morger sixteen years ago,
when he was twenty-seven.</p>
<p>Together they had built Protec-Clothes into a
million-dollar concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you can run it,&#8221; Frelaine said,
handing the slip of paper to Morger. If only the mail would come
earlier, he thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Do you own a Protec-Suit?&#8221;&#8217; Morger read
aloud, holding the paper close to his eyes. &#8220;&#8217;The finest tailoring
in the world has gone into Morger and Frelaine&#8217;s Protec-Suit, to make
it the leader in men&#8217;s fashions.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p>Morger cleared his throat and glanced at
Frelaine. He smiled and read on.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Protec-Suit is the safest as well as the
smartest. Every Protec-Suit comes with special built-in gun
pocket, guaranteed not to bulge. No one will know you are carrying
a gun&#8212;except you. The gun pocket is exceptionally easy to get at,
permitting fast, unhindered draw. Choice of hip or breast
pocket.&#8221; &#8220;Very nice,&#8221; Morger commented.</p>
<p>Frelaine nodded morosely.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;The Protec-Suit Special has the fling-out gun
pocket, the greatest modern advance in personal protection. A
touch of the concealed button throws the gun into your hand, cocked,
safeties off. Why not drop into the Protec-Store nearest
you? Why not be safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; Morger said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a very
nice, dignified ad.&#8221; He thought for a moment, fingering his white
mustache. &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t you mention that Protec-Suits come in a
variety of styles, single and double-breasted, one and two-button
rolls,
deep and shallow flares?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. I forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frelaine took back the sheet and jotted a note
on the edge of it. Then he stood up, smoothing his jacket over his
prominent stomach. Frelaine was forty-three, a little overweight,
a little bald on top. He was an amiable-looking man with cold eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Relax,&#8221; Morger said. &#8220;It&#8217;ll come in
today&#8217;s mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frelaine forced himself to smile. He felt
like pacing the floor, but instead sat on the edge of the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think it was my first kill,&#8221; he said,
with a deprecating smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how it is,&#8221; Morger said. &#8220;Before I
hung up my gun, I couldn&#8217;t sleep for a month, waiting for a
notification. I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men waited. Just as the silence
was becoming unbearable, the door opened. A clerk walked in and
deposited the mail on Frelaine&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>Frelaine swung around and gathered up the
letters. He thumbed through them rapidly and found what he had
been waiting for&#8212;the long white envelope from ECB, with the official
government seal on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; Frelaine said, and broke into
a grin. &#8220;That&#8217;s the baby!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine.&#8221; Morger eyed the envelope with
interest, but didn&#8217;t ask Frelaine to open it. It would be a breach
of etiquette, as well as a violation in the eyes of the law. No
one was supposed to know a Victim&#8217;s name except his Hunter. &#8220;Have
a good hunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect to,&#8221; Frelaine replied
confidently. His desk was in order&#8212;had been for a week. He
picked up his briefcase.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good kill will do you a world of good,&#8221;
Morger said, putting his hand lightly on Frelaine&#8217;s padded
shoulder. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been keyed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Frelaine grinned again and shook
Morger&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish I was a kid again,&#8221; Morger said, glancing
down at his crippled leg with wryly humorous eyes. &#8220;Makes me want
to pick up a gun again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man had been quite a Hunter in his
day. Ten successful hunts had qualified him for the exclusive Tens
Club. And, of course, for each hunt Morger had had to act as
Victim, so he had twenty kills to his credit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure hope my Victim isn&#8217;t anyone like you,&#8221;
Frelaine said, half in jest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. What number will
this be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The seventh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucky seven. Go to it,&#8221; Morger
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get you into the Tens yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frelaine waved his hand and started out the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just don&#8217;t get careless,&#8221; warned
Morger. &#8220;All it takes is a single slip and I&#8217;ll need a new
partner. If you don&#8217;t mind, I like the one I&#8217;ve got now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful,&#8221; Frelaine promised.</p>
<p>Instead of taking a bus, Frelaine walked to his
apartment. He wanted time to cool off. There was no sense in
acting like a kid on his first kill.</p>
<p>As he walked, Frelaine kept his eyes strictly
to the front. Staring at anyone was practically asking for a
bullet, if the man happened to be serving as Victim. Some Victims
shot if you just glanced at them.</p>
<p>Nervous fellows. Frelaine prudently looked
above the heads of the people he passed.</p>
<p>Ahead of him was a huge billboard, offering J.
F. O&#8217;Donovan&#8217;s services to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;Victims!&#8221; the sign proclaimed in huge red
letters. &#8220;Why take chances? Use an O&#8217;Donovan accredited
Spotter. Let us locate your assigned killer. Pay after you
get him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sign reminded Frelaine. He would call
Ed Morrow as soon as he reached his apartment.</p>
<p>He crossed the street, quickening his
stride. He could hardly wait to get home now, to open the envelope
and discover who his victim was.</p>
<p>Would he be clever or stupid? Rich, like
Frelaine&#8217;s fourth Victim, or poor, like the first and
second? Would he have an organized spotter service, or try to go
it on his own?</p>
<p>The excitement of the chase was wonderful,
coursing through his veins, quickening his heartbeat. From a block
or so away, he heard gunfire.</p>
<p>Two quick shots, and then a final one.</p>
<p>Somebody got his man, Frelaine
thought. Good for him.</p>
<p>It was a superb feeling, he told
himself. He was alive again.</p>
<p>At his one-room apartment, the first thing
Frelaine did was call Ed Morrow, his spotter. The man worked as a
garage attendant between calls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Ed? Frelaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hi, Mr. Frelaine.&#8221; He could see the
man&#8217;s thin, grease-stained face, grinning flat-lipped at the telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out on one, Ed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck, Mr. Frelaine,&#8221; Ed Morrow
said. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll want me to stand by?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I don&#8217;t expect to be gone
more than a week or two.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably get my notification of Victim
Status within three months of the kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be standing by. Good hunting,
Mr. Frelaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. So long.&#8221; He hung
up. It was a wise safety measure to reserve a first-class
spotter. After his kill, it would be Frelaine&#8217;s turn as Victim.</p>
<p>Then, once again, Ed Morrow would be his life
insurance.</p>
<p>And what a marvelous spotter Morrow
was! Uneducated-stupid, really.</p>
<p>But what an eye for people! Morrow was a
natural. His pale eyes could tell an out-of-towner at a
glance. He was diabolically clever at rigging an ambush.</p>
<p>An indispensable man.</p>
<p>Frelaine took out the envelope, chuckling to
himself, remembering some of the tricks Morrow had turned for the
Hunters. Still smiling, he glanced at the data inside the envelope.</p>
<p>Janet-Marie Patzig.</p>
<p>His Victim was a female!</p>
<p>Frelaine stood up and paced for a few
moments. Then he read the letter again. Janet-Marie
Patzig. No mistake. A girl. Three photographs were
enclosed, her address, and the usual descriptive data.</p>
<p>Frelaine frowned. He had never killed a
female.</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, then picked up the
telephone and dialed ECB.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emotional Catharsis Bureau, Information
Section,&#8221; a man&#8217;s voice answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, look,&#8221; Frelaine said. &#8220;I just got my
notification and I pulled a girl. Is that in order?&#8221; He gave
the clerk the girl&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in order, sir,&#8221; the clerk replied
after a minute of checking micro-files. &#8220;The girl registered with
the board under her own free will. The law says she has the same rights
and
privileges as a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you tell me how many kills she has?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, sir. The only information
you&#8217;re allowed is the Victim&#8217;s legal status and the descriptive data
you have received.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221; Frelaine paused. &#8220;Could I
draw another?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can refuse the hunt, of course. That
is your legal right. But you will not be allowed another Victim
until you have served. Do you wish to refuse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; Frelaine said hastily. &#8220;I was
just wondering. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hung up and sat down in his largest
armchair, loosening his belt.</p>
<p>This required some thought.</p>
<p>Damn women, he grumbled to himself, always
trying to horn in on a man&#8217;s game. Why can&#8217;t they stay home?</p>
<p>But they were free citizens, he reminded
himself. Still, it just didn&#8217;t seem feminine.</p>
<p>He knew that, historically speaking, the
Emotional Catharsis Board had been established for men and men
only. The board had been formed at the end of the fourth world
war&#8212;or sixth, as some historians counted it.</p>
<p>At that time there had been a driving need for
permanent, lasting peace.</p>
<p>The reason was practical, as were the men who
engineered it.</p>
<p>Simply&#8212;annihilation was just around the corner.</p>
<p>In the world wars, weapons increased in
magnitude, efficiency and exterminating power. Soldiers became
accustomed to them, less and less reluctant to use them.</p>
<p>But the saturation point had been
reached. Another war would truly be the war to end all
wars. There would be no one left to start another.</p>
<p>So this peace had to last for all time, but the
men who engineered it were practical. They recognized the tensions
and dislocations still present, the cauldrons in which wars are
brewed. They asked themselves why peace had never lasted in the
past.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because men like to fight,&#8221; was their answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; screamed the idealists.</p>
<p>But the men who engineered the peace were
forced to postulate, regretfully, the presence of a need for violence
in a large percentage of mankind.</p>
<p>Men aren&#8217;t angels. They aren&#8217;t fiends,
either. They are just very human beings, with a high degree of
combativeness.</p>
<p>With the scientific knowledge and the power
they had at that moment, the practical men could have gone a long way
toward breeding this trait out of the race. Many thought this was
the answer.</p>
<p>The practical men didn&#8217;t. They recognized
the validity of competition, love of battle, courage in the face of
overwhelming odds. These, they felt, were admirable traits for a
race, and insurance toward its perpetuity.</p>
<p>Without them, the race would be bound to
retrogress.</p>
<p>The tendency toward violence, they found, was
inexplicably linked with ingenuity, flexibility, drive.</p>
<p>The problem, then: To arrange a peace that
would last after they were gone. To stop the race from destroying
itself, without removing the responsible traits.</p>
<p>The way to do this, they decided, was to
rechannel Man&#8217;s violence.</p>
<p>Provide him with an outlet, an expression.</p>
<p>The first big step was the legalization of
gladiatorial events, complete with blood and thunder. But more was
needed. Sublimations worked only up to a point. Then people
demanded the real thing.</p>
<p>There is no substitute for murder.</p>
<p>So murder was legalized, on a strictly
individual basis, and only for those who wanted it. The
governments were directed to create Emotional Catharsis Boards.</p>
<p>After a period of experimentation, uniform
rules were adopted.</p>
<p>Anyone who wanted to murder could sign up at
the ECB. Giving certain data and assurances, he would be granted a
Victim.</p>
<p>Anyone who signed up to murder, under the
government rules, had to take his turn a few months later as Victim&#8212;if
he survived.</p>
<p>That, in essence, was the setup. The
individual could commit as many murders as he wanted. But between
each, he had to be a Victim. If he successfully killed his Hunter,
he could stop, or sign up for another murder.</p>
<p>At the end of ten years, an estimated third of
the world&#8217;s civilized population had applied for at least one
murder. The number slid to a fourth, and stayed there.</p>
<p>Philosophers shook their heads, but the
practical men were satisfied.</p>
<p>War was where it belonged&#8212;in the hands of the
individual.</p>
<p>Of course, there were ramifications to the
game, and elaborations.</p>
<p>Once its existence had been accepted it became
big business. There were services for Victim and Hunter alike.</p>
<p>The Emotional Catharsis Board picked the
Victims&#8217; names at random. A Hunter was allowed two weeks in which
to make his kill. This had to be done by his own ingenuity,
unaided. He was given the name of his Victim, address and
description, and allowed to use a standard-caliber pistol. He
could wear no armor of any sort.</p>
<p>The Victim was notified a week before the
Hunter. He was told only that he was a Victim. He did not
know the name of his Hunter. He was allowed his choice of
armor. He could hire spotters. A spotter couldn&#8217;t kill; only
Victim and Hunter could do that. But he could detect a stranger in
town, or ferret out a nervous gunman.</p>
<p>The Victim could arrange any kind of ambush in
his power to kill the Hunter.</p>
<p>There were stiff penalties for killing or
wounding the wrong man, for no other murder was allowed. Grudge
killings and gain killings were punishable by death.</p>
<p>The beauty of the system was that the people
who wanted to kill could do so. Those who didn&#8217;t&#8212;the bulk of the
population&#8212;didn&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>At least, there weren&#8217;t any more big
wars. Not even the imminence of one.</p>
<p>Just hundreds of thousands of small ones.</p>
<p>Frelaine didn&#8217;t especially like the idea of
killing a woman; but she had signed up. It wasn&#8217;t his
fault. And he wasn&#8217;t going to lose out on his seventh hunt.</p>
<p>He spent the rest of the morning memorizing the
data on his Victim, then filed the letter.</p>
<p>Janet Patzig lived in New York. That was
good. He enjoyed hunting in a big city, and he had always wanted
to see New York. Her age wasn&#8217;t given, but to judge from her
photographs, she was in her early twenties.</p>
<p>Frelaine phoned for his jet reservations to New
York, then took a shower.</p>
<p>He dressed with care in a new Protec-Suit
Special made for the occasion.</p>
<p>From his collection he selected a gun, cleaned
and oiled it, and fitted it into the fling-out pocket of the
suit. Then he packed his suitcase.</p>
<p>A pulse of excitement was pounding in his
veins. Strange, he thought, how each killing was a new
thrill. It was something you just didn&#8217;t tire of, the way you did
of French pastry or women or drinking or anything else. It was
always new and different.</p>
<p>Finally, he looked over his books to see which
he would take.</p>
<p>His library contained all the good books on the
subject. He wouldn&#8217;t need any of his Victim books, like L. Fred
Tracy&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Tactics for the Victim</span>,
with its insistence on a rigidly
controlled environment, or Dr. Frisch&#8217;s <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Don&#8217;t Think like a Victim!</span></p>
<p>He would be very interested in those in a few
months, when he was a Victim again. Now he wanted hunting books.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Tactics for Hunting Humans</span>
was the standard and
definitive work, but he had it almost memorized. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Development of
the Ambush</span> was not adapted to his present needs.</p>
<p>He chose <span style="font-style: italic;">Hunting in Cities</span>,
by Mitwell and
Clark, <span style="font-style: italic;">Spotting the Spotter</span>,
by Algreen, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Victim&#8217;s In-group</span>,
by
the same author.</p>
<p>Everything was in order. He left a note
for the milkman, locked his apartment and took a cab to the airport.</p>
<p>In New York, he checked into a hotel in the
midtown area, not too far from his Victim&#8217;s address. The clerks
were smiling and attentive, which bothered Frelaine. He didn&#8217;t
like to be recognized so easily as an out-of-town killer.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw in his room was a
pamphlet on his bedtable. <span style="font-style: italic;">How to Get
the Most Out of Your
Emotional Catharsis</span>, it was called, with the compliments of the
management. Frelaine smiled and thumbed through it.</p>
<p>Since it was his first visit to New York, he
spent the afternoon just walking the streets in his Victim&#8217;s
neighborhood. After that, he wandered through a few stores.</p>
<p>Martinson and Black was a fascinating
place. He went through their Hunter-Hunted room. There were
lightweight bullet-proof vests for Victims, and Richard Arlington hats,
with bulletproof crowns.</p>
<p>On one side was a large display of a new .38
caliber sidearm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Use the Malvern Strait-shot!&#8221; the ad
proclaimed. &#8220;ECB-approved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carries a load of twelve shots. Tested
deviation less than .001 inches per 1000 feet. Don&#8217;t miss your Victim!
Don&#8217;t risk your
life without the best! Be safe with Malvern!&#8221;</p>
<p>Frelaine smiled. The ad was good, and the
small black weapon looked ultimately efficient. But he was
satisfied with the one he had.</p>
<p>There was a special sale on trick canes, with
concealed four-shot magazine, promising safety and concealment. As
a young man, Frelaine had gone in heavily for novelties. But now
he knew that the old-fashioned ways were usually best.</p>
<p>Outside the store, four men from the Department
of Sanitation were carting away a freshly killed corpse. Frelaine
regretted missing the take.</p>
<p>He ate dinner in a good restaurant and went to
bed early.</p>
<p>Tomorrow he had a lot to do.</p>
<p>The next day, with the face of his Victim
before him, Frelaine walked through her neighborhood. He didn&#8217;t
look closely at anyone. Instead, he moved rapidly, as though he
were really going somewhere, the way an old Hunter should walk.</p>
<p>He passed several bars and dropped into one for
a drink. Then he went on, down a side street off Lexington Avenue.</p>
<p>There was a pleasant sidewalk cafe
there. Frelaine walked past it.</p>
<p>And there she was! He could never mistake
the face. It was Janet Patzig, seated at a table, staring into a
drink. She didn&#8217;t look up as he passed.</p>
<p>Frelaine walked to the end of the
block. He turned the corner and stopped, hands trembling.
</p>
<center>
<p>* * *</p>
</center>
<p>Was the girl crazy, exposing herself in the
open? Did she think she had a charmed life?</p>
<p>He hailed a taxi and had the man drive around
the block. Sure enough, she was just sitting there. Frelaine
took a careful look.</p>
<p>She seemed younger than her pictures, but he
couldn&#8217;t be sure. He would guess her to be not much over
twenty. Her
dark hair was parted in the middle and combed above her ears, giving
her a nunlike appearance. Her expression, as far as Frelaine could
tell, was one of resigned sadness.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t she even going to make an attempt to
defend herself?</p>
<p>Frelaine paid the driver and hurried to a
drugstore. Finding a vacant telephone booth, he called ECB.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure that a Victim named Janet-Marie
Patzig has been notified?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, sir.&#8221; Frelaine tapped on the
door
while the clerk looked up the information. &#8220;Yes, sir. We have
her
personal confirmation. Is there anything wrong, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Frelaine said. &#8220;Just wanted to
check.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, it was no one&#8217;s business if the girl
didn&#8217;t want to defend herself.</p>
<p>He was still entitled to kill her.</p>
<p>It was his turn.</p>
<p>He postponed it for that day however, and went
to a movie. After dinner, he returned to his room and read the ECB
pamphlet. Then he lay on his bed and glared at the ceiling.</p>
<p>All he had to do was pump a bullet into
her. Just ride by in a cab and kill her.</p>
<p>She was being a very bad sport about it, he
decided resentfully, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, Frelaine walked by the cafe
again. The girl was back, sitting at the same table. Frelaine
caught a cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive around the block very slowly,&#8221; he told
the driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; the driver said, grinning with sardonic
wisdom.</p>
<p>From the cab, Frelaine watched for
spotters. As far as he could tell, the girl had none. Both her hands
were in
sight upon the table.</p>
<p>An easy, stationary target.</p>
<p>Frelaine touched the button of his
double-breasted jacket. A fold flew open and the gun was in his
hand. He broke it open and checked the cartridges, then closed it
with a snap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slowly, now,&#8221; he told the driver.</p>
<p>The taxi crawled by the cafe. Frelaine
took careful aim, centering the girl in his sights. His finger
tightened on the trigger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A waiter had passed by the girl. He didn&#8217;t
want to chance winging someone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Around the block again,&#8221; he told the driver.</p>
<p>The man gave him another grin and hunched down
in his seat. Frelaine wondered if the driver would feel so happy
if he
knew that Frelaine was gunning for a woman.</p>
<p>This time there was no waiter around. The
girl
was lighting a cigarette, her mournful face intent on her
lighter. Frelaine centered her in his sights, squarely above the
eyes,
and held his breath.</p>
<p>Then he shook his head and put the gun back in
his pocket.</p>
<p>The idiotic girl was robbing him of the full
benefit of his catharsis.</p>
<center>
<p>* * *</p>
</center>
<p>He paid the driver and started to walk.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too easy, he told himself. He was
used to a real chase. Most of the other six kills had been quite
difficult. The Victims had tried every dodge. One had hired at least a
dozen
spotters. But Frelaine had reached them all by altering his
tactics to meet the situation.</p>
<p>Once he had dressed as a milkman, another time
as a bill collector.</p>
<p>The sixth Victim he had had to chase through
the Sierra Nevadas. The man had clipped him, too. But
Frelaine had done better.</p>
<p>How could he be proud of this one? What
would the Tens Club say?</p>
<p>That brought Frelaine up with a start. He
wanted to get into the club.</p>
<p>Even if he passed up this girl he would have to
defend himself against a Hunter. If he survived, he would still be
four
hunts away from membership.</p>
<p>At that rate, he might never get in.</p>
<p>He began to pass the cafe again, then, on
impulse, stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Janet Patzig looked at him out of sad blue
eyes, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, look,&#8221; he said, sitting down. &#8220;If
I&#8217;m
being fresh, just tell me and I&#8217;ll go. I&#8217;m an
out-of-towner. Here on a
convention. And I&#8217;d just like someone feminine to talk to. If
you&#8217;d
rather I didn&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Janet Patzig said tonelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A brandy,&#8221; Frelaine told the
waiter. Janet Patzig&#8217;s glass was still half full.</p>
<p>Frelaine looked at the girl and he could feel
his heart throbbing against his ribs. This was more like it&#8212;having
a
drink with your Victim!</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Stanton Frelaine,&#8221; he said, knowing
it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Janet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Janet what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Janet Patzig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice to know you,&#8221; Frelaine said, in a
perfectly natural voice. &#8220;Are you doing anything tonight, Janet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m probably being killed tonight,&#8221; she said
quietly.</p>
<p>Frelaine looked at her carefully. Did she
realize who he was? For all he knew, she had a gun leveled at him
under the table.</p>
<p>He kept his hand close to the fling-out button.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a Victim?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You guessed it,&#8221; she said
sardonically. &#8220;If I were you, I&#8217;d stay out of the way. No
sense getting hit by mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frelaine couldn&#8217;t understand the girl&#8217;s
calm. Was she a suicide?</p>
<p>Perhaps she just didn&#8217;t care. Perhaps she
wanted to die.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got any spotters?&#8221; he asked,
with the right expression of amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; She looked at him, full in the face,
and Frelaine saw something he hadn&#8217;t noticed before.</p>
<p>She was very lovely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a bad, bad girl,&#8221; she said
lightly. &#8220;I
got the idea I&#8217;d like to commit a murder, so I signed for
EB. Then&#8212;I
couldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frelaine shook his head, sympathizing with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m still in, of course. Even if I
didn&#8217;t shoot, I still have to be a Victim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why don&#8217;t you hire some spotters?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t kill anyone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
just couldn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t even have a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a lot of courage,&#8221; Frelaine said,
&#8220;coming out in the open this way.&#8221; Secretly, he was amazed at her
stupidity.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; she asked
listlessly. &#8220;You can&#8217;t hide from a Hunter. Not a real one. And I don&#8217;t
have enough
money to make a good disappearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since it&#8217;s in your own defense, I should
think&#8212;&#8221; Frelaine began, but she interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve made up my mind on
that. This whole
thing is wrong, the whole system. When I had my Victim in the
sights&#8212;when I saw how easily I could&#8212;I could&#8212;&#8221;&nbsp; She pulled herself
together quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s forget it,&#8221; she said and smiled.</p>
<p>Frelaine found her smile dazzling.</p>
<p>After that, they talked of other
things. Frelaine told her of his business, and she told him about
New
York. She was twenty-two, an unsuccessful actress.</p>
<p>They had supper together. When she
accepted Frelaine&#8217;s invitation to go to the Gladiatorials, he felt
absurdly elated.</p>
<p>He called a cab&#8212;he seemed to be spending his
entire time in New York in cabs&#8212;and opened the door for her. She
started in. Frelaine hesitated. He could have pumped a shot
into her at
that moment. It would have been very easy.</p>
<p>But he held back. Just for the moment, he
told himself.</p>
<p>The Gladiatorials were about the same as those
held anywhere else, except that the talent was a little
better. There
were the usual historical events, swordsmen and netmen, duels with
saber and foil.</p>
<p>Most of these, naturally, were fought to the
death.</p>
<p>Then bull fighting, lion fighting and rhino
fighting, followed by the more modern events. Fights from behind
barricades with bow and arrow.</p>
<p>Dueling on a high wire.</p>
<p>The evening passed pleasantly.</p>
<p>Frelaine escorted the girl home, the palms of
his hands sticky with sweat.</p>
<p>He had never found a woman he liked
better. And yet she was his legitimate kill.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t know what he was going to do.</p>
<p>She invited him in and they sat together on the
couch. The girl lighted a cigarette for herself with a large
lighter,
then settled back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you leaving soon?&#8221; she asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; Frelaine said. &#8220;The
convention is only lasting another day.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
sorry to see you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were quiet for a while. Then Janet
went to fix him a drink.</p>
<p>Frelaine eyed her retreating back. Now was
the time. He placed his hand near the button.</p>
<p>But the moment had passed for him,
irrevocably. He wasn&#8217;t going to kill her. You don&#8217;t kill the
girl you love.</p>
<p>The realization that he loved her was
shocking. He&#8217;d come to kill, not to find a wife.</p>
<p>She came back with the drink and sat down
opposite him, staring at emptiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Janet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat, just looking at him. There were
tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;I&#8217;m a
Victim. I won&#8217;t live long enough to&#8212;&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be
killed. I&#8217;m your Hunter.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stared at him a moment, then laughed
uncertainly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to kill me?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to marry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly she was in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;The
waiting&#8212;I&#8217;ve been
so frightened&#8212;&#8220; &#8220;It&#8217;s all over,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;Think what a story
it&#8217;ll
make for our kids. How I came to murder you and left marrying you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She kissed him, then sat back and lighted
another cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s start packing,&#8221; Frelaine said. &#8220;I
want&#8212;&#8220; &#8220;Wait,&#8221; Janet interrupted. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t asked if I love
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was still smiling and the cigarette lighter
was pointed at him. In the bottom of it was a black hole. A
hole just
large enough for a .3 caliber bullet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t kid around,&#8221; he objected, getting to his
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not being funny, darling,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In a fraction of a second, Frelaine had time to
wonder how he could ever have thought she was not much over
twenty. Looking at her now&#8212;really looking at her&#8212;he knew she
couldn&#8217;t
be much less than thirty. Every minute of her strained, tense
existence
showed on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t love you, Stanton,&#8221; she said very
softly, the cigarette lighter poised.</p>
<p>Frelaine struggled for breath. One part of
him
was able to realize detachedly what a marvelous actress she really
was. She must have known all along.</p>
<p>Frelaine pushed the button, and the gun was in
his hand, cocked and ready.</p>
<p>The blow that struck him in the chest knocked
him over a coffee table.</p>
<p>The gun fell out of his hand. Gasping,
half-conscious, he watched her take careful aim for the coup de grace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I can join the Tens,&#8221; he heard her say
elatedly as she squeezed the trigger.</p>
