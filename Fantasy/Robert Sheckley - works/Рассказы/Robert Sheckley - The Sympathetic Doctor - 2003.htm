      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        had been on a city street in New York. Now, suddenly and for no discernable 
        reason, I was on a dirt road in the countryside. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Ahead of me I could see a city, a lot of little stone and marble buildings, 
        piled high up the side of a hill. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The other people on the road were peasant types. They wore what looked 
        like smocks, pulled back from the shoulders because it was hot out, even 
        though it seemed to be almost evening. The people around me were mostly 
        colored a medium olive-brown. Some of them carried staves, or maybe they 
        were cudgels. Some of them were herding goats into the city. The bleating 
        of the goats was the loudest sound I heard.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        What did I do? The first thing I did was get off the road, sit down on 
        a small boulder, and try to figure out what had happened to me. I'll tell 
        you, I was shaking. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I had just been on West End Avenue and 96<sup>th</sup> street. Now I was 
        standing in rolling, open land, and there was an ancient-looking city 
        in the near distance, a bunch of small marble and brick buildings piled 
        on a hill. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I thought, "Oh-oh, Toto, we're not in Kansas any more." Except that I 
        had no Toto with me. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I was in this place alone, and I was wearing a sort of sheepskin tunic, 
        and leather sandals had replaced my Nikes, in fact all my clothing was 
        gone, and my wallet with it, but now I had a leather pouch hanging around 
        my neck by a leather strap.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I opened the pouch. There were a few irregular coins in it, and when I 
        looked at them, I could make out Greek letters. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        That's when I decided I must have passed through some sort of a portal 
        or doorway in time. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Why just me and no one else? The mind moves at lightning speed to find 
        answers. Maybe I had a rare blood type, though they had never told me 
        so at Flower and Fifth hospital. Maybe I had a peculiar brain configuration. 
        Who the hell knows? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        There was no one around I could ask. The people passing on the road were 
        peasant types, dressed much as I was, and some of them were leading donkeys, 
        and some were driving goats.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I'll tell you, it freaked me out. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I can't really remember what I had been doing before all this began. Going 
        to the subway, I think. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I know, I'm in a stressed state. Maybe I'm not responsible for what I'm 
        saying, but believe me, I'm telling the truth as I know it. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I was in the past. My condition was made all the worse by my inability 
        to do anything about it. To have any control over it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It's like someone, some god or demon, told me, "OK, we're going to give 
        you one of the most precious dreams of mankind. We're going to let you 
        walk in an age not your own, an age out of the splendid past."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        This someone could also have said, "We're also going to give you automatic 
        command of the local language. We're going to dress you appropriately, 
        and we'll even throw in a little local currency so you can buy yourself 
        a drink. What do you think about that?" </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I would have gone for it with effusive thanks. But that's before it happened, 
        and I could see it's not working out like I thought it would.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I heard a voice call out, "Ho, wayfarer! Wait for me!" </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I turned. A small, portly, bearded man dressed similarly to me came bustling 
        up. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You're 
        new around here," he said. I nodded. "And you're going to Corinth." He 
        gestured at the city ahead of us. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"So 
        what?" I said. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You're 
        not from around here?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No," 
        I said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"So 
        you're going to need a place to sleep in Corinth."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Hmm," 
        I said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Have 
        you got a place?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I shook my head.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This 
        is your lucky day. I've got just the place for you."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Well, I was pretty sure the man was a charlatan of some sort, but I needed 
        to talk to someone so I just nodded, not making much in the way of replies, 
        which didn't slow him down at all. He told me about The Mysteries, an 
        organization he was an agent for. The Mysteries of Hermes owned Hermetic 
        temples all over Greece. They were in accord with the main religion of 
        the country, the worship of Zeus and the Olympians, of whom Hermes was 
        one. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It 
        isn't very expensive to join the organization. And in return, the owners 
        of the temples will make sleeping quarters available for you in whatever 
        city you visit. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It sounded to me like: If you join our Elks club, you can sleep in any 
        of the Elk lodges around the United States. Can't beat that for a travel 
        bargain.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I nodded.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"In 
        Corinth," he said. "the main temple is right near the marketplace. Handy 
        for business."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I nodded again. It was pretty impressive, in a way. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I didn't know how to get rid of the guy, so I let him tag along with me. 
        Anyhow, I would need a place to sleep. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Pylas, as he called himself, invited me to an inn for a bowl of lentils. 
        I accepted. It was a sort of low dive--the ancient equivalent of a trucker's 
        cafÈ, maybe. Pylas had his own utensils, and when I looked in my pouch 
        I found that I had a big wooden spoon.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It was pretty exciting being in ancient Greece. If I hadn't been so nervous 
        about what was going to happen next, I would have asked him where I might 
        find Plato or Aristotle. But I didn't ask. That was just too touristy 
        for me.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Pylas continued talking to me about the advantages of joining the Mysteries. 
        He found me a place to sleep that night on the portico of one of the Hermes 
        temples. He never got a chance to collect a fee, because I was gone before 
        he woke up. I don't mean I left of my own free will. I just woke up somewhere 
        else. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I woke up in another city, this one built of wood and stone, and with 
        broad paved streets. In a square ahead of me was a Byzantine-style church. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I was wearing a sort of unbelted smock woven of some coarse fabric. I 
        had wooden clogs on my feet. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It was crowded. There were a lot of people pushing around in the square. 
        Most of the men were bearded. A lot of them wore fur hats. The sky overhead 
        was gray, and there was an icy wind. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It took no great intelligence on my part to decide I was probably in Russia. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The people were all talking in what must have been Russian. It didn't 
        sound like Russian to me. I understood it. It seemed to be the only language 
        I spoke, just as Greek had been my only language yesterday.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Russia. And not in modern times, because I saw no cars. Only horses and 
        carriages.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I knew I had to keep a low profile, stay out of trouble. My best bet was 
        to find some really cheap tavern, get a bowl of borsht and a piece of 
        bread, see if I could stay the night there, and hope that I'd find myself 
        somewhere else in the morning. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Whoever or whatever was doing this had moved me so twice now. Why not 
        a third time?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I was thinking so hard about staying out of trouble that I blundered right 
        into it. I started to walk and stepped right in front of an officer on 
        a horse. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I dodged out of the way, and the horse dodged in the same direction. I 
        would have gone under his hooves if the rider had not promptly pulled 
        him back on its hind legs. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The officer swung out of the saddle, came up and glared at me belligerently.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Are 
        you blind? Why did you get in my way like that?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I cowered, mumbling apologies.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You're 
        not going to last long in St. Petersburg like that. Where are you from?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Odessa," 
        I said, the first name that came to my mind.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Really? 
        You don't sound like a southerner. Let me see your travel permit and city 
        pass."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        My heart sank. This officer seemed to be in his early thirties, gorgeously 
        turned out in a tight-fitting uniform of blue and red and gold. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Well?" 
        he said. He scowled, his drooping black moustache drawing down around 
        his long chin.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I looked in my bag. No papers. Just a couple of rubles to buy dinner with, 
        if I hadn't run into this. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Time to improvise. "My papers are gone," I said. "I was in an inn earlier, 
        and someone must have stolen them."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He glared at me. His eyes were very blue and cold.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You 
        have no papers?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No, 
        your excellency. I just came here to find work. I'm harmless, believe 
        me."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        My declaration of harmlessness seemed to stir his suspicions. "Maybe you 
        are and maybe you're not. Steady, Sonya," he said to his horse--his mare--who 
        was acting skittish. "Anyhow, it's something for the politicians to sort 
        out."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        A small crowd had gathered around us. The officer looked around. A tall, 
        thin man in a long black overcoat stepped forward.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes, 
        Captain, is there anything wrong?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This 
        fellow doesn't have his papers. Claims to be from Odessa, but his accent's 
        all wrong."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Is 
        that a fact?" the tall man said. He made a hand gesture. Two men, dressed 
        similarly to him, came up. The crowd fell back and ostentatiously paid 
        us no attention.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The first man said, "You'd better come with us."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        And that's how I found myself in St. Petersburg's prison, the Peter and 
        Paul Fortress. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The two men led me through a series of gates. From their occasional muttered 
        conversation with each other, I learned we were going to the Trubetskoi 
        Bastion, facing the river Neva. They said that Bakunin had been held here, 
        and Kropotkin before him. When I asked why I was being held, they didn't 
        answer. Then one of them grunted that it would all be explained to me 
        in due course. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        A guard unlocked an iron door and led us into a corridor. There were cell 
        doors all along it, and there were stoves, fed from the corridor, which 
        heated the cells.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The guard unlocked a cell and locked me in. I was alone in a fair-sized 
        square room, perhaps fifteen feet on a side. It was very hot in the room. 
        There was a window at one side, within a deep embrasure in the thick walls. 
        It was covered with an iron wire net. I could see a wall perhaps twenty 
        feet away. And I could catch a glimpse of the gray St. Petersburg sky. 
        And there I sat, now in despair. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        These men probably thought I was subversive. No matter who was in charge 
        of Russia, that didn't promise well for me.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        An hour or so later, the warden, bearded, in a baggy dark suit, visited 
        me. He brought pen and paper, and advised me to make as full confession 
        as possible if I hoped for any clemency. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He advised me to write the complete truth, left the pen and paper, and 
        then left. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I didn't know what to write. The truth as I knew it was wilder than anything 
        they might have encountered in the pages of Baron Munchausen. They seemed 
        to want something political from me. But I didn't know anything about 
        the politics of this period. I was probably in Russia some time before 
        the First World War. No one was going to believe that I was a loyal Czarist.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I lay down on the iron cot in a state of complete despair. Despite the 
        stifling heat, I fell asleep. And when I awoke, I was somewhere else.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I woke up with no sense of transition. One minute, I had been in Russia, 
        in St. Petersburg's Peter and Paul fortress, probably at the turn of the 
        19<sup>th</sup> century; now I was standing on a modern city street down 
        which automobiles moved. Automobiles! I was back in modern times. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        A wave of dizziness hit me and I had to lean against the side of the building 
        to keep from falling. I sometimes experience vertigo on these locale-changing 
        journeys.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The cop must have been standing right close by watching me. He walked 
        up and asked, "You all right, bub?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Oh, 
        yes," I said. "It's just--"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Just 
        what?" he asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He seemed sympathetic. There was one thing I really wanted to know. It 
        seemed such a simple, natural question. So I blurted it out. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Could 
        you tell me what year this is?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        You see, knowing when you are is more important than knowing where you 
        are. Once you can pinpoint when you are, you're half familiar with it 
        already. You have some idea how to cope.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        But this is not the question to ask if you're trying to pass unnoticed. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The cop didn't answer, but began asking me a lot of other questions. When 
        I couldn't tell him where I was staying, or even produce a driver's license--I 
        was in a seersucker suit with a five dollar bill in one pocket and nothing 
        else--his suspicions were further aroused</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Where 
        do you come from?" he asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"My 
        last stop was St. Petersburg."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"St. 
        Petersburg, Florida?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"St. 
        Petersburg, Russia. Around the year 1900 as near as I could judge. But 
        I'm not an expert on these matters."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He stared at me. I realized I shouldn't have said that. I was showing 
        off, perhaps, or, more accurately, I was reaching out desperately for 
        sympathy. Not a hanging offense. But the cop was really suspicious of 
        me now. When I could produce no identification, not even a driver's license, 
        his opinion that I was a crazy person was confirmed. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        'Where are you from?" he asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        don't know," I told him. "Wait, I do know. New York. A place like this."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He nodded. "Come along with me," he said. "I know a place where you can 
        spend the night. Maybe a couple of nights. Your last stop was St. Petersburg, 
        you said? In Russia? You'll like this better."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He took me (I really had no choice in the matter) to a large graystone 
        building a few blocks away. It appeared to be a hospital of some sort. 
        A receptionist signed me in. Several attendants brought a wheel chair, 
        strapped me in it, and wheeled me down the corridor. They took me to a 
        room with a bed, two chairs, and a bureau. They unstrapped me, motioned 
        me to one of the chairs, and left.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I got up and tried the door.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It was locked. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I sat down again. I calmed myself by remembering that no matter how long 
        they tried to keep me here, I'd likely be out pretty soon. A day or two 
        at the most, to judge by how it had already gone. Then, if this followed 
        the form, I'd find myself in a new place, at a different time, with a 
        new set of problems. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Quite a lot of time passed. I dozed for a while, sitting in the chair. 
        Then, suddenly the door opened and a man walked in. He was tall, with 
        dark, curly hair. He appeared to be in his early forties. He wore a long 
        white doctor's coat. A stethoscope hung around his neck. He had a metal-backed 
        clipboard under his arm. He wore a plastic nametag which read Dr. Irving 
        Schwartz, M.D., Ph.D.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Good 
        morning," he said. "We don't seem to have your name on file."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'm 
        Jonathan Weiss," I told him.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He said, "How are you this morning, Jonathan?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'm 
        here," I said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes," 
        he said. "But how are you, really?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Literally, 
        I am as you see me. But actually, I am in a different state."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Dr. Schwartz was carrying a pad on a clipboard, with a ball-point pen 
        attached. He made a note, then gave me what I considered a searching look. 
        "Interesting differentiation. Would you care to explain further?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I looked at him--searchingly, I suppose. He had a square, honest face. 
        A small dark beard, well trimmed. He looked sympathetic, open-minded, 
        intelligent. I decided to take a chance. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This 
        has been a difficult day for me," I said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Oh?" 
        He made a mark on his clipboard. "How so?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Well, 
        I just arrived here in your city this morning."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He nodded. "Plane? Train?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"None 
        of the above," I told him. "I just showed up. That is to say, I opened 
        my eyes a little while ago and found myself in a strange place, which 
        turned out to be your city. The policeman who questioned me outside must 
        have thought I was behaving oddly. He brought me here."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Now 
        let me get this straight," the doctor said. "You just opened your eyes 
        and found yourself here? Where were you before this? Where were you last 
        night?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"My 
        last stop was St. Petersburg, Russia, around the turn of the century, 
        I think. Before that, I was in ancient Greece. Around 300 B.C., I think, 
        but I'm no expert on these matters. I can barely make sense of the Greek 
        alphabet. I think I was in Post Homeric Greece, but pre-Platonic, I think."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        is all this ancient Greek stuff," Dr. Schwartz said. "Did you see some 
        movie on this subject? Or read an historical novel?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's 
        not like that," I said. "I'm telling you what really happened to me."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        A bell sounded, and a green light on the wall came on.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Dr. Schwartz closed his clipboard. He said, "I have appointments. I'd 
        like to talk to you later. That all right with you? I may have some clues 
        on your condition."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I shrugged. "It doesn't look like I'll be going anywhere soon."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Later," 
        Schwartz said, and left. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I hardly ever tell people how it is with me. They usually assume I'm crazy 
        and lock me away. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Of course, I am only one man, and not a well-schooled man. I can't prove 
        any of this. I cannot give you a surveyor's view of Babylon or Rome or 
        Ur of the Chaldees. Particularities seem always to be exceptional. I have 
        never seen, knowingly, an average temple, tavern, or citizen.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Another thing that bothers me is, why am I so often in famous places? 
        Why am I in Rome rather than Pisa, London instead of Birmingham, New York 
        instead of White Plains? In the timeñtrack of the Earth there are infinitely 
        more obscure and unknown places than famous ones. What brings me to the 
        ones well-known in history? Am I somehow selecting them myself? Or is 
        there some other principle at work? I can speculate on this, but I can 
        never know. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I asked Dr. Schwartz about that when he returned.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        can't answer that directly," Dr. Schwartz said. "The formula is a little 
        involved. But I can tell you something about the condition from which 
        you suffer. Spatio-temporal dislocation, known today as Jenkins-Steiner 
        syndrome, is not unknown in this day and age, especially since the publication 
        of Jenkins' and Steiner's authoritative work on the subject. But it is 
        still rare, and is frequently mistaken for other ailments of a psychological 
        nature. The documentation is extensive and persuasive. Historical instances 
        of sufferers from Jenkins-Steiner include Victor Hauser, and the man who 
        walked around the horses. "The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus" would be a good 
        early example if they had not been proven to be purely legendary, and 
        thus not to be included in our list of historical instances. The so-called 
        Man from Mars, who walked the streets of Moscow early in the 20<sup>th</sup> 
        century and was written up in newspapers at the time, and even photographed, 
        was once believed a hoax, has but been since shown to be a literal and 
        well-documented case of a man or, rather, creature suffering from an alien 
        form of Jenkins-Steiner, called Jenkins-Steiner Alien Strain A. I could 
        go on and on, but perhaps you would like to consult our source itself."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        would," I said. "But first can you tell me if there is any cure for Jenkins-Steiner? 
        Because I must tell you, fascinating as my condition may seem to you, 
        I am heartily sick of it. I'm tired of journeying up and down the ages, 
        never staying in one place for long, sometimes for no longer than a day, 
        never having any friends, no wife, no family, no work, no income, not 
        even any hobbies or interests, for my condition prevents me all that."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You 
        really want to get rid of your Jenkins-Steiner?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"With 
        all my heart!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Interesting. 
        There are others who would do anything to get it. Time-travel is one of 
        the oldest and most precious dreams of the human race. But if you really 
        want to get rid of it--</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        do!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Then 
        let me tell you, your case is not without hope. Amazing strides have been 
        made recently in humano-temporal engineering. Although we can hold out 
        no definitive promise, I can tell you that--"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Whatever Schwartz was going to say was suddenly cut short when the door 
        to the room was violently flung open. Two husky men in white pants, with 
        short-sleeved white shirts, came through, followed by a nurse, also in 
        white.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"There 
        he is!" the nurse said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The husky attendants advanced, and I cowered back. They seized--not me, 
        but Schwartz, who collapsed in their arms like a rag doll. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Mr. 
        Lepsky!" the nurse said to him in a scolding voice. "You promised you 
        wouldn't act out again. But you stole Dr. Schwartz's coat and pad, and 
        here you are, impersonating a doctor." </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Impersonating?" 
        the false Schwartz cried. "You think this is an impersonation? Wail until 
        I tell the authorities how you are treating me. Where I come from, I am 
        a licensed physician. Nurse, this man is a sufferer from Jenkins-Steiner, 
        and I demand--"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Take 
        him to Observation B," the nurse said, and they dragged Schwartz or whatever 
        his name was out. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Nurse," 
        I said, "I need to speak further with that man! I have reason to believe 
        he has information that could be vital to me."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The 
        only vital thing Lepsky has is a gift of gab," the nurse said. "You may 
        see him again on the open floor, during recreation hour, if he behaves."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I looked forward to the meeting. But of course, before it could take place, 
        I was somewhere else.</font></p>
