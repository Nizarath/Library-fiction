      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
        left our story of the West Nile virus with the threat from Hamster United, 
        the hamster consciousness that had learned of the deal to substitute hamsters 
        for humans as West Nile's new victims. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The hamsters needed to show us at once that their threat was real. Since 
        the hamsters had collateral links with dogs, they appealed to the canine 
        universal consciousness, reminding the dogs that they had been having 
        it easy for too long, living off humans. It was time they did something 
        for the species. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The dog consciousness agreed, and started sending down orders to individual 
        dogs. Seeing eye dogs started running their people into cars and phone 
        poles. Sniffer dogs used by the ATF and police departments, begin to sniff 
        out only thyme. Cuddlesome home pets begin to attack when addressed as 
        "Cuddley-po," or "Dweat Big Dog." </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        ›t took a special agreement by the Universal Congress of Group-Consciousnesses 
        to permit the Hamsters United to install the necessary reactions to produce 
        these effects. It was objected that this would give the dogs intelligence. 
        But this was quickly refuted by a video of Dignity puppies, as they came 
        to be called, chasing their tails in the same silly way puppies always 
        have. This convinced the council that a modicum of intelligence need not 
        be fatal to levity of spirit. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Bailey had a hell of a time convincing his wife of the truth and urgency 
        of all that he was telling her. The only way they could imagine convincing 
        her superiors was by making a training film. They called it "Group Consciousnesses 
        Unleashed! The Next big Threat to Mankind." </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It took time and money, but they got it done with assistance from a famous 
        director who liked what he called "weird projects." The Signal Corps gave 
        the film their stamp; of approval, and this, coupled with the increase 
        in dog attacks, convinced the government powers. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The need for action became more apparent when the President was convinced 
        that, unless something was changed soon, they would have to order all 
        household pets destroyed. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        An order like that would be unpopular and would lose him the next election. 
        But, as the virulence and frequency of dog-owner attacks increased, it 
        became apparent that to let this go on would also lose him the election.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        A search was mounted to find a new host for the West Nile virus and the 
        mosquitoes who carried it. The lungfish, as a possible host, was examined 
        and found wanting: too much trouble to program the lungfish to swim close 
        to the surface, or to equip the virus-carrying mosquitoes to adapt to 
        a life spent at least part of the time under water. The problems of arranging 
        so that the mosquito's proboscis would not become too soggy were difficult, 
        enough. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        An attempt was made to get the mosquitoes to infect each other. This proved 
        a failure: there seems to be some kind of difficulty in producing death 
        by auto-intoxication among the unintelligent.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Finally American scientists found a suitable substitute host animal. It 
        was a small, blind mole--the leaf-nosed bat mole-- living in its native 
        Guatemala on corn husks, and bothering no one. It was not even a true 
        mole. It had fewer links with other species than any other creature found. 
        It was even believed that this mole might be Martian in origin, that bits 
        of its DNA traveled from Mars to Earth on meteorites or by some means 
        not yet determined, and that the mole set itself up in blind independence 
        from all the other species of Earth--a creature without an enemy, subsistent 
        only on corn husks which existed in Guatemala in great quantity--a crime 
        of self-sufficient hubris which would be paid for now.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The attack of the viruses was diverted from dogs to leaf nosed bat moles. 
        Teams of scientists, working day and night, found ways to get the moles 
        to reproduce at an unprecedented rate. This broke existing laws against 
        cloning, but they were superceded in the face of the national emergency. 
        Moles were delivered to all parts of the Earth. This was expensive, since 
        several pharmaceutical companies had developed special drugs to enable 
        the moles to live in a variety of climates, from sub-freezing cold to 
        post-boiling hot. The Pharmaceuticals had to be paid their royalties, 
        and mole drugs did not come cheap.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        But this turned out to be no solution after all. The universal consciousness 
        of the leaf-nosed bat moles appealed to the Congress of Group-Consciousnesses. 
        The Council, working with what they possessed instead of Intelligence, 
        declared the current state of things intolerable. Unless Earth, in the 
        entity of the United States, immediately ceased and desisted this activity, 
        a universal attack on Humanity by all Consciousnesses would be declared. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Word of this reached the President, causing him to cancel several golf 
        games. Intent on re-election though he was, the possibility of the destruction 
        of mankind worried him. It is reported that he put down his putter and 
        said, "You know, reelection isn't worth it if it's going to cost the lives 
        of everybody on the planet. There is a time when the Higher Morality must 
        prevail." </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Millions of high school and college children studied his words in new 
        courses on The Higher Morality. The opposition pointed out that to let 
        mankind perish would be worse than the deeds of all the dictators the 
        President opposed. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        can we do?" the President asked the Consciousnesses Council. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The Council took a few days to consider the question. Meanwhile, attacks 
        of rabid pugs and frenzied Chihuahuas upon postal workers demanding federal 
        protection went on. The only way to protect the postal workers was to 
        send them out accompanied by at least one guard, armed with an automatic 
        weapon. Given the number of postal workers in the country, this would 
        have been cost-prohibitive. But the President was between a rock and a 
        hard place. Weapons manufacturers tooled up for a big year.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        jhe President was in a mood to listen when the Council of Universal Consciousnesses 
        delivered its advice.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        They said, "You humans have done a remarkable job with the development 
        of your individual intelligence, and the use of them to improve your individual 
        lots. But an unfortunate bias seems to have accompanied your thinking. 
        That is the notion that the purpose of human life is to enhance said life 
        at the expense of every other form of life. You have taken the position 
        that all creatures large or small are subservient to you, and are there 
        to serve you, to be used, and, if proven unuseful, to be destroyed. This 
        cannot be tolerated any longer. The best we can suggest is that you cease 
        your efforts to destroy the West Nile virus and accept that you must suffer 
        from this disease, and some of you must die, to prevent the worse effects 
        attendant upon destroying or deviating West Nile."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        This was of course an unacceptable alternative for mankind, and their 
        self-appointed representative, the president, ,wrestled with it. A decision 
        had to be made soon. </font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The Congress of Group Consciousnesses now threatened to unleash other 
        doomsday scenarios on the Earth. For a beginning, and to show that they 
        were indeed serious, they declared that all ice cream was henceforth poisonous, 
        and fatal to humans within three days of ingestion. They even put into 
        place a hasty scenario as to how this could happen scientifically--for 
        they knew that unless the scientists were convinced, they would get nowhere. 
        Their autonomous killer spore theory made good sense, its only weakness 
        being the spontaneous generation of the spores for no scientific reason 
        at all. But a rationalization was found as to how this would be possible, 
        and the scientists, showing an unusual degree of good sense, urged the 
        president to close with the offer.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's 
        only a stopgap," the more bellicose among them pointed out, in a secret 
        protocol. "We'll be working on this in secret, biding our time, figuring 
        out how to enforce our knowledge that we humans are the chief ornament 
        of everything in the Universe, that everything else is there to serve 
        us, and that we can kill whatever we please in fulfilling this mandate 
        from our own own innermost nature." </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The President gave the order, though he had grave doubts about it. It 
        seemed to him that he was acting like some dictators in the past he had 
        been opposed to: pretending compliance but secretly putting together his 
        weapons and planning for a great breakout. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        His advisors convinced him that this was not the case. He was only doing 
        what any other intelligent, dedicated human would do under similar circumstances. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The president agreed and the order was given. The president won reelection 
        on the platform, "He saved us from the Evil Council," as the Congress 
        on Universal Consciousnesses was known on Earth. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        And to make it all better, there was a brief economic upturn when the 
        president tooled up for war against the Central Asian Confederacy, which 
        had been found guilty of promulgating the doctrine of Communism under 
        the guise of a religious message from the poet Kabir, and of producing 
        and stockpiling atomic weapons for no clear purpose but with clear evil 
        intent. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Americans, as opposed to evil as they always have been, rallied to this 
        war. The rest of the world reluctantly went along. And as a capper and 
        final resolution, the president declared all West Nile Virus sufferers 
        to be Heroes of the Fight For Human Freedom, to be awarded medals, to 
        be given free hospital care and cost of living benefits. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        This move was applauded. But Congress proved lax in voting the necessary 
        funds... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        More important, a top movie entertainer went on tv at her own expense 
        and recited Tennyson's "Locksley Hall, ending with the stirring lines, 
        "And the gentle Earth shall slumber, wrapped in Universal Law."</font></p>
