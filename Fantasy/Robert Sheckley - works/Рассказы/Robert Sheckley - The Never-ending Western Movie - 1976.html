<A name=1></a><b>The Never-Ending Western Movie <br></b>Robert Sheckley <br>
 <br> <br>The name is Washburn: just plain Washburn to my friends, Mister Washburn to <br>
enemies and strangers. Saying that I've said everything, because you've seen me a <br>
thousand times, on the big screen in your neighborhood theater or on the little pay-tv <br>screen in your living room, riding through Cholla cactus and short grass, my famous <br>
derby pulled down over my eyes, my famous Colt 44 with the 7 1/2-inch barrel strapped <br>down to my right leg. But just now I'm riding in a big air-conditioned Cadillac, sitting <br>between my agent-manager Gordon Simms, and my wife, Consuela. We've turned off <br>
State Highway 101 and we're bouncing along a rutted dirt road which will end presently <br>at the Wells Fargo Station that marks one of the entrances to The Set. Simms is talking <br>
rapidly and rubbing the back of my neck like I was a fighter about to enter the ring, <br>which is more or less the situation. Consuela is quiet. Her English isn't too good yet. <br>
She's the prettiest little thing imaginable, my wife of less than two months, a former Miss <br>Chile, a former actress in various Gaucho dramas filmed in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. <br>
This entire scene is supposed to be off-camera. It's the part they never show you: the <br>return of the famous gunfighter, all the way from Bel Air in the jolly jittery year of 2031 <br>to the Old West of the mid-1900's. <br>
Simms is jabbering away about some investment he wants me to come in on, some <br>
new seabed mining operation, another of Simms's get-richer-quick schemes, because <br>
Simms is already a wealthy man, as who wouldn't be with a thirty-percent bit on my <br>earnings throughout my ten biggest years as a star? Simms is my friend, too, but I can't <br>
think about investments now because we're coming to The Set. <br>
Consuela, sitting on my right, shivers as the famous weatherbeaten old station comes <br>
into view. She's never really understood The Never-Ending Western Movie. In South <br>America they still make their movies in the old-fashioned way, everything staged, <br>everything faked, and the guns fire only blanks. She can't understand why America's <br>
famous Movie has to be done for real when you could contrive all the effects and nobody <br>would get killed. I've tried to explain it to her, but it sounds ridiculous in Spanish. <br>
It's  different  for  me  this  time,  of  course:  I'm  coming  out  of  retirement  to  make  a <br>
cameo appearance. I'm on a no-kill contract—famous gunman to do a comedy bit with <br>
Old Jeff Mangles and Natchez Parker. There's no script, of course; there never is in The <br>Movie. We'll improvise around any situation that comes up—we, the commedia dell'arte <br>
players of the Old West. Consuela doesn't understand any of this. She's heard about <br>contracts to kill, but a no-kill contract is something new in her experience. <br>
And now we've arrived. The car stops in front of a low, unpainted pinewood building. <br>
Everything on this side of it is 21st-century America in all its recycled and reproduced <br>gory. On the other side is the million-acre expanse of prairie, mountains and desert, with <br>
its thousands of concealed cameras and microphones, that is The Set for The Never-<br>Ending Movie. <br>
I'm in costume already—blue jeans, blue-and-white checked shirt, boots, derby, <br>
rawhide jacket, and 3. 2 pounds of revolver. A horse is waiting for me at the hitching <br>
post of the other side of the station, with all my gear tied aboard in a neat blanket roll. <br>An assistant director checks me over and finds me in order: no wristwatch or other <br>anachronisms for the cameras to find. “All right, Mr. Washburn,” he says, “you can go <br>
through whenever you're ready.” <br>
Simms gives his main-event boy a final rub on the back. He's bouncing up and down <br>
on his toes, excited, envying me, wishing he were the one to be riding out into the <br>desert, a tall, slow-moving man with mild manners and sudden death always near his <br>
right hand. But Simms is short and fat and nearly bald and he would never do, certainly <br>not for a heroic gunman's role, so he lives it vicariously. I am Simms's manhood, and he <br>
and I have ridden the danger trail many times and our trusty 44 had cleared out all <br>opposition, until we reigned supreme, the absolute best gunslinger in the West, the one <br>who finally retired when all the opposition was dead or lying low... Poor Simms, he <br>
always wanted us to play that last big scene, the final definitive walkdown on some dusty <br>Main Street. He wanted us to go out high, wide and handsome, not for the money, we've <br>
got too much of that as it is, but just for the glory, retiring from The Movie in a blaze of <br>
<hr>
<A name=2></a>gunfire at the top of our form. I wanted it that way myself, but the opposition got <br>cautious, and Washburn spent a final ridiculous year in The Movie, riding around looking <br>
for something to do, six-shooter ready, but never finding anyone who wanted to shoot it <br>out with him. And even this cameo appearance—for Simms it is a mockery of all that we <br>
have stood for, and I suppose it's that way for me, too. (It is difficult to know where I <br>start and where Simms ends, difficult to separate what I want and what Simms wants, <br>
difficult to face this, the end of our great years in The Movie.) <br>
Simms shakes my hand and grips me hard on the shoulder and says nothing in that <br>
manly Western style he's picked up through the years of associating with me, being me. <br>Consuela hugs me, there are tears in her eyes, she kisses me, she tells me to come back <br>to her soon. Ah, those incredible first months with a new wife! The splendor of it, before <br>
the dreary old reality sets in! Consuela is number four, I've ridden down a lot of trails in <br>my time, most of them the same, and now the director checks me again for lipstick <br>
smears, nods okay, and I turn away from Consuela and Simms, throw them the little <br>two-finger salute I'm famous for, and stride across the creaking floor of the Wells Fargo <br>
Office and out the other side, into the blazing sunshine and the world of The Never-<br>Ending Western Movie. <br>
 <br>From far away, the camera picks up a lone rider, moving antlike between brilliantly <br>
striped canyon walls. We see him in successive shots against an unfolding panorama of <br>
desert scenery. Here he is in the evening, silhouetted against a flaming sky, derby <br>cocked jauntily on the back of his head, cooking over a little fire. How he is asleep, rolled <br>
in his blanket, as the embers of his fire fade to ash. Before dawn the rider is up again, <br>making coffee, preparing for the day's ride. Sunrise finds him mounted and moving, <br>
shielding his eyes from the sun, leaning back long in the stirrups, letting his horse pick <br>its own way over the rocky slopes. <br>
I am also the audience watching me the actor, as well as the actor watching me the <br>
audience. It is the dream of childhood come true: to play a part and also watch ourselves <br>play it. I know now that we never stop acting, never stop watching ourselves act. It is <br>
merely  an  irony  of  fate  that  the  heroic  images  I  see  coincide  with  what  you,  sitting  in <br>front of your little screen, also see. <br>
Now the rider has climbed to a high saddleback between two mountains. It is cold up <br>
here, a high wind is blowing, the rider's coat collar is turned up and is derby is tied in <br>
place with a bright wool scarf. Looking over the man's shoulder, far below, we see a <br>settlement, tiny and lost in the immensity of the landscape. We follow as the rider clucks <br>
to his tired horse and begins the journey down to the settlement. <br>
 <br>The derbied rider is walking his horse through the settlement of Comanche. There is <br>
one street—Main Street—with its saloon, boarding house, livery stable, blacksmith's, <br>general store, all as quaint and stark as a Civil War daguerreotype. The desert wind <br>
blows unceasingly through the town, and a find dust is settled over everything. <br>
The rider is recognized. Loungers in front of the general store say: “Hey, it's <br>
Washburn!” <br>
I dismount stiffly in front of the livery stable—a tall, travel-stained man, gun belt worn <br>
low and strapped down, the cracked horn-faced gun butt standing out easy to reach, <br>easy to see. I turn and rub my face—the famous, long, sorrowful face, the puckered scar <br>along one cheekbone, the narrow unblinking gray eyes. It is the face of a tough, <br>
dangerous, unpredictable man; yet a sympathetic one. It is me watching you watching <br>me. <br>
I come out of the livery stable, and there to greet me is Sheriff Ben Watson, an old <br>
friend, hard tanned face and black handlebar mustache, tin star gleaming on his worsted <br>
vest. <br>
“Heard you might be coming through,” Watson says. “Heard you been to Californee for <br>
a spell.” <br>
“Californee” is our own special code word for retirement. <br>“That's so,” I say. “How's everything around here?” <br>
“So-so,” Watson tells me. “I don't suppose you heard about Old Jeff Mangles?” <br>
 <br>
2<br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>I wait. The sheriff says, “Happened just yesterday. Old Jeff got thrown, out on the <br>
desert. We figure his horse shied at a rattler—Christ knows that I told him to sell that big <br>
skittery wall-eyed brute. But you know Old Jeff…” <br>
“What happened to him?” I ask. <br>
“Well, like I say, he got thrown and dragged. He was dead before Jimmy Conners <br>
found him.” <br>
Long silence. I push the derby to the back of my head. Finally I say, “Okay, Ben, what <br>
else do you want to tell me?” <br>
The sheriff is ill at ease. He fidgets, shifting from one foot to the other. I wait. Jeff <br>
Mangles dead; that blows the scene I was hired to play. What other development is <br>coming up? <br>
Watson says, “You must be thirsty. What say we put down a beer…” <br>“Just tell me the news.” <br>
“Well... You ever hear of a cowpuncher from the Panhandle name of Little Joe Potter?” <br>I shake my head. <br>
“He came drifting up this way a while ago, bringing with him quite a reputation as a <br>
fast gun. Didn't you hear about the shootout down at Twin Peaks?” <br>
Now that he mentions it, I do remember hearing something about it. Bit I've been out <br>
to Californee doing other things, and shootouts just didn't interest me much until right <br>now. <br>
“This Little Joe Potter,” Watson goes on, “he went up against four X-Bar riders in a <br>
dispute over some woman. The say it was quite a fight. The result was that Little Joe <br>
blew them four riders all to hell, and he picked himself up quite a reputation thereby.” <br>
“So what?” I ask. <br>
“Well, some time after that, Little Joe was in a poker game with some boys down Gila <br>
Bend way...” Watson stops, uncomfortable. “Washburn, maybe you better get the story <br>
from Charlie Gibbs, since he spoke to a man who was actually present at that game. <br>Yeah, you better hear it from Charlie. See you later, Washburn.” <br>
The sheriff moves away, following The Movie dictum of keeping the talk-scenes short <br>
and letting other people have a piece of the action. <br>
I walk to the saloon. There is someone following me, a kid, no more than eighteen or <br>
nineteen, a gangling snubnosed freckled kid in too-short overalls and cracked boots. He <br>wears a gun. What does he want of me? What everyone else wants, I suppose. <br>
I enter the saloon, my spurs clattering on the plank floor. Charlie Gibbs is drinking at <br>
the bar, a fat sloppy man all grin and crinkle, not wearing a gun because Charlie Gibbs is <br>
a comic character and therefore does not kill or get killed. Charlie is also our local Screen <br>Actors' Guild representative. <br>
I buy him a drink and ask him about Little Joe Potter's famous poker game. <br>
“I heard about it from Texas Jim Claire. You remember Texas Jim, don't you <br>
Washburn? Good old boy who works for the Donaldson outfit as a wrangler? Well, sir, <br>
Texas Jim was in this poker game over by way of the Gila Bend. The action commenced <br>to get hot. There was this one big jackpot at the end, and Doc Dailey bet a thousand <br>
dollars Mex on his hand. Little Joe was right fond of the cards he was holding, but he <br>didn't have no more money to back hisself with. Doc said he'd take collateral, if Little Joe <br>
could think of any. Little Joe thought about it for a while, and then he said, 'How much <br>would you give me for Mr. Washburn's derby?' There was a silence then, because nobody <br>just walks up and takes away Mr. Washburn's derby, not without first killing the man <br>
underneath it. But on the other hand, Little Joe was not known as a braggart, and he'd <br>handled hisself well during that shootout with the X-Bar riders. So Doc, he thought about <br>
it a while, then he said,  <br>
‘Sure, Joe, I'll allow you a thousand for a ringside seat when you got to take it off <br>
him.’ ‘You can have that ringside seat for nothing,’ says Little Joe, ‘if I lose this hand, <br>which I'm not fixing to do.’ So the bet is accepted and they show down. Little Joe's four <br>
eights lose to Doc's four Jacks. Little Joe rises and stretches, and says, 'Well, Doc, looks <br>like you're going to get your ringside seat after all.’” <br>
Charlie finishes off his drink and looks at me with bright, malicious eyes. I nod, finish <br>
my own drink, and go out back to the outhouse. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
3<br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>The outhouse is a designated off-camera area. We use it for talks which are <br>
necessary, but are out of our Western context. Charlie Gibbs comes out a few minutes <br>
later. He turns on the hidden air conditioning, takes a pack of cigarettes from behind a <br>beam, lights up, sits down and makes himself comfortable. As SAG representative, <br>
Charlie spends a fair amount of time out here listening to gripes and grievances. This is <br>his office, and he's tried to make it pleasant for himself. <br>
Charlie says, “I suppose you want to know what's going on?” <br>“Damned right I do,” I tell him. “What is this crap about Joe Potter coming to take <br>
away my derby?” <br>
“Don't get excited,” Charlie says, “everything is in order. Potter is a new star on his <br>
way up. After Jeff Mangles got killed, it was natural to match up you and him. Potter <br>
went along with it. Your agent was approached yesterday and he renegotiated your <br>contract. You're getting a hell of a bonus for this shootout appearance.” <br>
“Simms renegotiated my contract? Without asking me first?” <br>“You weren't available then. Simms said it  would  be  fine  with  you.  He  gave  a <br>
statement to the newspapers about how you and he had talked about this many times, <br>and that it had always been your desire to leave The Movie big, at the top of your firm, in <br>
one last shootout. He said he didn't have to discuss it with your because you and he hand <br>talked it over many times and you and he were closer than brothers. He said he was glad <br>this chance had come up, and he knew you would be glad, too.” <br>
“Christ! That simple-minded Simms!” <br>“Was he setting you up?” Charlie asks. <br>
“No, it's not like hat at all. We did talk a lot about a final showdown. I did tell him that <br>
I'd like to end big…” <br>
“But it was just talk?” Charlie suggests. <br>“Not exactly.” But it's one thing to talk about a shootout when you're retired and save <br>
in your house in Bel Air. It's another to suddenly find yourself involved in a fight without <br>preparation. “Simms didn't set me up; but he did involve me in something that I'd want <br>to make up my own mind about.” <br>
“So the situation is,” Charlie says, “that you were a fool for shooting off your mouth <br>
about wanting a final match, and your agent was a fool for taking you at your word.” <br>
“That's the way it looks.” <br>“So what are you going to do about it?” <br>
“I'll tell you,” I say, “as long as I've talking to my old buddy Charlie, and not to Gibbs <br>
the SAG representative.” <br>
“Sure,” Charlie says. <br>“I'm going to waltz on out of here,” I say. “I'm thirty-seven years old and I haven't <br>
practiced gunplay for a year. I've got a new wife…” <br>
“You don't have to go into all that,” Gibbs says. “Life is sweet, that says it all. As your <br>
friend, I approve. As your SAG representative, I cant tell you that the Guild won't back <br>
you up if you break a valid contract made by your legally appointed representative. If <br>The Company sues you, you're all alone on your lonesome.” <br>
“Better all alone than underground with company,” I tell him. “How good is this Little <br>
Joe?” <br>
“He's good. But not as good as you are, Washburn. You're the best I ever seen. You <br>
thinking about meeting him?” <br>
“Nope. Just asking.” <br>
“Keep it that way,” Charlie says. “As your friend, I advise you to get out and stay out. <br>
You've already taken everything that can be gotten out of The Movie: you're a hero, <br>
you're rich, and you've got a pretty young wife. You've won everything in sight. Now <br>don't hand around and wait for someone to take it off you.” <br>
“I'm not fixing to,” I tell him. But I find that  my  hand  has  come  to  rest  on  my  gun <br>
butt. <br>
 <br>I go back into the saloon. I sit alone at the table, a shot glass of whiskey in front of <br>
me, a thin black Mexican cigar between my teeth. I am thinking about the situation. <br>
Little Joe is riding up from the south. He'll probably figure to find me here in Comanche. <br>But I don't figure to be here. Safest way would be for me to ride back the way I came, <br>
back to the Wells Fargo Station and out into the world again. But I'm not going to do it <br>
 <br>
4<br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a>that way. I'm going out of The Set by way of Brimstone in the extreme northeastern <br>corner, thus making a complete tour of The Territory. Let them figure that one out... <br>
Suddenly a long shadow falls across the table, a figure has moved between me and <br>
the light, and without a thought I roll out of my chair, gun already drawn, hammer back, <br>
forefinger tightening on the trigger. A boy's frightened, high-pitched voice says, “Oh! <br>Excuse me, Mr. Washburn!” It's that snubnosed freckle-faced kid I saw watching me <br>
earlier, now gaping at the end of my gun, scared, as he damned well should be having <br>just startled me out of a year's growth. <br>
I thumb down the hammer of my 44. I get up, holster the gun, dust myself off, pick <br>
up my chair and sit down on it. Curly the bartender brings me another drink. I say to the <br>kid, “Kid, don't you know better than to move up sudden on a man like that? I should <br>
have blown you to hell just on the off-chance.” <br>
“I'm sorry, Mr. Washburn,” he says. “I'm new out here, I didn't realize... I just wanted <br>
to tell you how much I admire you.” <br>
He was new, all right; he looked fresh out of The Company's School of Western Skills, <br>
which we must all graduate from before we're even allowed on The Set. I had been just <br>as raw as him during my first weeks in The Movie. <br>
“Someday,” he tells me, “I'm going to be like you. I thought maybe you could give me <br>
a few pointers. I got this old gun here…” <br>
The kid draws, and once again I react without thinking, slap the gun out of his hand, <br>
chop him down with a fist to the ear. <br>
“Goddamn you!” I shout, “haven't you got no sense at all? You just don't up and draw <br>
like that unless you're meaning to use it.” <br>
“I just wanted to show you my gun,” he says, not getting up yet. <br>
“If you want someone to look at your gun,” I tell him, “take it out of your holster slow <br>
and easy, keeping your fingers outside the trigger guard. And first announce what you're <br>
going to do.” <br>
“Mr. Washburn,” he says, “I don't know what to say.” <br>“Don't say anything,” I tell him. “Just get out of here. You look like bad luck to me. Go <br>
show someone else your goddamned gun.” <br>
“Shall I show it to Joe Potter?” he asks, getting up and dusting himself off. <br>
He looks at me. I haven't said a word. He gulps, he knows he's put his foot in it again. <br>I stand up slow. “Would you care to explain that remark?” <br>
“I didn't mean nothing by it.” <br>“You sure of that?” <br>
“Real sure, Mr. Washburn. I'm sorry!” <br>“Get out of here,” I say, and the kid scrams fast. <br>I go over to the bar. Curly has the whiskey bottle out, but I wave it away and he <br>
draws me a beer. “Curly,” I say, “I know they can't help being young, but isn't there <br>something they can do about being so stupid?” <br>
“I reckon not, Mr. Washburn,” Curly says. <br>We are silent for a few moments. Then Curly says, “Natchez Parker sent word he'd like <br>
to see you.” <br>
“All right,” I tell him. <br>
 <br>Dissolve to: a ranch on the edge of the desert. In the chuckhouse, the Chinese cook is <br>
sharpening his knives. Bud Farrell, one of the hands, is sitting on a crate peeling <br>
potatoes. He is singing as he works, his long horse face bent over the spuds. The cook, <br>oblivious to him, looks out the window, says, “Rider comes.” <br>
Bud Farrell gets up, looks, scratches his hayseed head, looks again: “That's something <br>
more than just a rider, you heathen Chinee. That's Mister Washburn, sure as God made <br>
little green apples!” <br>
Bud Farrell gets up, walks to the front of the main house, calls, “Hey, Mr. Parker! Mr. <br>
Washburn is riding up here!” <br>
 <br>Washburn and Parker are sitting together at a small wooden table over steaming mugs <br>
of coffee in Natchez Parker's sitting room. Parker is a huge mustachioed man sitting in a <br>straight-back wooden chair, an Indian blanket over his withered legs. He is paralyzed <br>
from the waist down because of an old bullet crease in the spine. <br>
 <br>
5<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>“Well, Washburn,” says Parker, “I heard about you and Little Joe Potter, just like <br>
everyone else in the Territory. Ought to be one hell of a meeting. Wish I could see it.” <br>
I say, “I wouldn't mind seeing it myself.” <br>“Where is it going to take place?” <br>
“In hell, I guess.” <br>Parker leans forward. “What does that mean?” <br>
“It means that I'm not meeting Little Joe. I'm riding for Brimstone, and then straight <br>
on, away from Little Joe and the whole damned West.” <br>
Parker leans forward and vigorously rubs his shock of gray hair. His big face puckers <br>
together like he puckers together like he had bitten into a rotten apple. <br>
“You're running?” he asks. <br>
“That's it,” Washburn says. <br>The old man grimaces, hawks, spits on the floor. He says, “I never thought to hear <br>
you of all people say a thing like that. I never thought to see you go against the values <br>you've always lived by.” <br>
“Natchez, those were never my values. They came ready-made with the role. Now I'm <br>
through with the role, and I'm turning in the values too.” <br>
The old man chewed that over for a while. The he said, “What in hell is the matter <br>
with you? Got too much to live for all of a sudden? Or just gone yellow?” <br>
“Call it what you like,” I tell him. “I came by to tell you. I owe you that.” <br>
“Well, wasn't that nice of you?” says Parker. “You owed me something and it was on <br>
your way anyhow, so you figured the least you could do was come by and tell me you <br>
was running away from a jumped-up baby gunslinger with one fight under his belt.” <br>
“Get off my back.” <br>
“Tom,” he says, “listen to me.” <br>I look up. Parker is the only man in the Territory who ever calls me by my first name. <br>
He doesn't do it often. <br>
“Now look,” he says, “I am not one for fancy speeches. But you simply can't run away <br>
like this, Tom. Not on account of anything but yourself. You've got to live with yourself, <br>
no matter where you go.” <br>
“I'll manage that just fine,” I tell him. <br>
Parker shakes his head. “Damn it all, what do you think this think is all about? They <br>
let us dress up in fancy clothes and strut our stuff like we owned the whole damned <br>
world. They pay us plenty just to be men. Not just when it's easy, like at the beginning. <br>We gotta stay men right straight through to the end, no matter what the end is. We don't <br>
just act these parts, Tom; we live them, we stake our lives on them, we are these parts. <br>Christ, anybody can dress up in a cowboy outfit and swagger down Main Street. But not <br>everyone can wear a gun and use it.” <br>
I say, “That's a beautiful speech, Parker, and you're such a pro that you've blown this <br>
scene. Get back in character and let's get on with it.” <br>
“Goddamn you,” Parker says, “I don't give a damn for the scene or The Movie or any <br>
of it. I'm talking to you straight now, Tom Washburn. We've been closer than kin ever <br>
since you came into the Territory, a frightened tanglefoot kid who mad a place for <br>himself on sheer guts. I'm not going to let you run away now.” <br>
“I'm finishing this coffee,” I tell him, “and riding on.” <br>Natchez suddenly twists in his chair, grabs a handful of my shirt and pulls my face <br>
close to his. In his other hand I see a knife. <br>
“Get out your knife, Tom. I'd rather kill you myself than let you ride away a coward.” <br>Parker's face is close to mine, glaring at me, the old man's breath sour in my face. I <br>
brace my left foot on the floor, plant my right foot on the edge of Parker's chair and push <br>hard. Parker's chair topples over and I see the look of shock on the old man's face as he <br>
falls to the floor. I draw my gun and take aim between his eyes. <br>
“Christ, Tom,” he says. <br>
I thumb back the hammer. “You stupid old bastard,” I say, “what do you think this is, <br>
some kind of game? You've gotten sorta heavy-handed and long-winded ever since that <br>bullet creased your spine. You think there are special rules, and you know all about <br>
them. But there aren't any rules. You don't tell me what to do and I don't tell you. You're <br>a crippled old man, but if you pick a fight with me I'm going to fight my own way, not <br>
yours, and I'm going to put you down any way I can.” <br>
 <br>
6<br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a>I take up slack on the trigger. Old Parker's eyes bulge, his mouth starts trembling, he <br>
tries to control himself but he can't. He screams, not loud, but high-pitched, like a <br>
frightened girl. <br>
I thumb down the hammer and put my gun away. “Okay,” I say, “maybe now you can <br>
wake up and remember how it really is.” <br>
I lift him up and slide the chair under him. “Sorry it's gotta be this way, Natchez. I'm <br>
going now.” <br>
I stop at the door and look back. Parker is grinning at me. “Glad to see you're feeling <br>
better, Tom. I should have remembered that you got nerves. All of the good ones have <br>nerves. But you'll be fine at the showdown.” <br>
“You old idiot, there's not going to be any showdown. I told you before, I'm riding out <br>
of here.” <br>
“Good luck, Tom. Give 'em hell!” <br>
“Idiot!” I get out of there. <br> <br>A horseman crosses a high ridge and lets his horse pick its own way down the other <br>
side to the desert floor. There is a soft hiss of wind, glitter of mica, sand gathered into <br>
long wavering windows. <br>
The noon sun beats down as the rider passes through gigantic rock formations carved <br>
by the wind into fantastic shapes. At evening, the rider dismounts and inspects his <br>
horse's hooves. He whistles tunelessly to himself, pours water from his canteen into his <br>derby, waters his horse, puts the had back on, and drinks sparingly himself. He hobbles <br>
the horse and makes camp on the desert. He sits by a little fire and watches the swollen <br>desert sun go down. He is a tall, lean man, with a battered derby on his head and a <br>
horn-handled 44 strapped down on his right leg. <br>
 <br>Brimstone: a desolate mining settlement on the northeastern edge of the Territory. <br>
Rising above the town is the natural rock formation of Devil's Highway—a broad, gently <br>sloping rock bridge. The far end, out of sight from here, is firmly anchored just outside <br>
The Set, two hundred yards and 150 years away. <br>
I come in on a limping horse. There aren't many people around, but I do spot one <br>
familiar face; it's that damned freckle-faced kid. He must have ridden pretty hard to get <br>here before me. I pass him by without a word. <br>
I sit on my horse for a while and admire the Devil's Highway. Five minutes' ride to the <br>
other side and I'll be out of the West for good, finished with it all, the good times and the <br>
bad, the fear and the laughter, the long slow days and the dull, dangerous nights. In a <br>few hours I'll be with Consuela, I'll be reading the newspapers and watching tv... <br>
Now I'm going to put down one last shot of redeye and then sashay out of here. <br>
I pull up my horse at the saloon. A few more people are on the street now, watching <br>
me. I walk into the saloon. <br>
 <br>There is one man drinking alone at the bar. He's short and stocky, wearing a black <br>
leather vest and a Mountain Man's buffalo hat. He turns; he carries one unholstered gun <br>high in his belt. I never saw him before, but I know who he is. <br>
“Howdy, Mr. Washburn,” he says. <br>“Howdy, Little Joe,” I reply. <br>He holds the bottle out questioningly. I nod. He reaches behind the bar, finds another <br>
shot glass, fills it up for me. We sip quietly. <br>
After a while I say, “Hope you didn't have too much trouble finding me.” <br>
“Not too much,” Little Joe says. He's older than I had expected, nearly thirty. He's got <br>
a tough, craggy face, high cheekbones, a black handlebar mustache. He sips his drink, <br>
then says to me, very gently, “Mr. Washburn, I heard a rumor which I don't believe. The <br>rumor said that you was leaving this Territory in sort of a hurry.” <br>
“That's right,” I tell him. <br>“The rumor also said that you wasn't planning to stay around long enough to give me <br>
the time of day.” <br>
“That's also true, Little Joe. I didn't figure I had no time for you. But here you are <br>
anyhow.” <br>
 <br>

<hr>
<A name=8></a>“Indeed I am,” Little Joe says. He rubs down the ends of his mustache and pulls hard <br>
at his nose. “Frankly, Mr. Washburn, I simply can't believe that you're not planning to <br>
waltz around with me. I know all about you, Mr. Washburn, and I just can't believe that.” <br>
“Better believe it, Joe,” I say to him. “I'm finishing this drink, and then I'm walking out <br>
this door and getting on my horse and riding over Devil's Highway.” <br>
Little Joe tugs at his nose again, frowns, pushes back his hat. “I never thought to hear <br>
this.” <br>
“I never thought to say it.” <br>
“You're really not going to face me?” <br>I finish my drink and set the shot glass down on the bar. “Take care of yourself, Little <br>
Joe.” I start toward the door. <br>
Little Joe says, “There's just one last thing.” <br>I turn. Little Joe is standing away from the bar, both hands visible. “I can't force you <br>
into a showdown, Mr. Washburn. But I did make a little bet concerning that derby of <br>yours.” <br>
“So I heard.” <br>“And so, although it pains me more than you can know, I'll have to have it.” <br>
I stand, facing him, not answering. <br>Little Joe says, “Look, Washburn, no sense you just standing there glaring at me. Give <br>
the hat or make your play.” <br>
I take off the derby. I smooth it on my sleeve, then sail it to him. He picks it up, never <br>
taking his eyes from me. He says, “Well, I'll be.” <br>
“Take care of yourself, Little Joe.” I walk out of the saloon. <br> <br>A crowd has assembled opposite the saloon. They wait and watch, talking in hushed <br>
voices. The saloon doors swing and a tall thin bareheaded man comes through. He is <br>
beginning to bald. He carries a 44 strapped down on his right leg, and he looks like he <br>knows how to use it. But the fact is, he hasn't used it. <br>
Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Washburn unties his horse, mounts it, and sets <br>
it at a walk toward the bridge. <br>
The saloon doors swing again. A short, stocky hard-faced man comes through, holding <br>
a battered derby. He watches the horseman ride away. <br>
Washburn spurs his horse, which hesitates a moment, then mounts the stone bridge. <br>
It takes constant urging to keep the horse going, picking its way across the sloping <br>pebble-clad surface, to the center. Here Washburn stops the horse, or allows it to stop. <br>
He sits at the highest point of the bridge's curve, astride the joint between two worlds, <br>but looking at neither. He reaches up to tug at his hat's brim and is mildly surprised to <br>find himself bareheaded. He scratches his forehead lazily, a man with all the time in the <br>
world. The he turns his horse around and starts back down the bridge to Brimstone. <br>
 <br>The crowd watches as Washburn rides toward them. They are motionless, silent. Then, <br>
realizing what is about to happen, they scatter for the shelter of wagons, duck down <br>
behind water troughs, crouch behind grain sacks. <br>
Only Little Joe Potter remains in the dusty street. HE watches while Washburn <br>
dismounts, shoos his horse out of the line of fire, walks slowly toward him. <br>
Little Joe calls out, “Hey, Washburn! Come back for your hat?” <br>Washburn grins, shakes his head. “No, Little Joe, I came back because it's our dance.” <br>
They both laugh, it is all some ridiculous joke. Then, suddenly, both mend draw. The <br>
heavy bark of their . 44s crashes through the town. Smoke and dust obscure the <br>
fighters. <br>
The smoke blows away. Both men are still standing. Little Joe's gin is pointed down. <br>
He twirls it, and watches it fall from his hand. Then he collapses. <br>
Washburn holsters his gun, walks over to Little Joe, kneels, lifts his head out of the <br>
dirt. <br>
“Goddamn,” Little Joe says, “that was one short dance, huh, Washburn?” <br>“Too short,” Washburn says. “Joe, I'm sorry...” <br>
But Little Joe doesn't hear this. His eyes have gone blank and unfocused, his body is <br>
limp. Blood trickles out of two holes in his chest, blood stains the dust from the large exit <br>
wounds in his back. <br>
 <br>

<hr>
<A name=9></a>Washburn gets to his feet, finds his derby in the dust, wipes it off, puts it on. HE walks <br>
over to his horse. People are coming out now, there is a buzz of conversation. Washburn <br>
sets one foot in the stirrup, begins to mount. <br>
At that moment, a wavering, high-pitched voice calls out, “Okay, Washburn, draw!” <br>
Washburn's face contorts as he whirls, trying to get his gun hand clear, trying to spin <br>
out of the line of fire. Even in that cramped and impossible posture he manages to get <br>
the 44 drawn, spins to see the freckled-faced kid ten yards away with gun drawn and <br>aimed, firing. <br>
Sunlight explodes in Washburn's head, he hears his horse scream, he is falling <br>
through the dusty floors of the world, falling as the bullets thud into him with a sound <br>like a butcher's cleaver swung flat against a side of beet. The world is coming apart, the <br>
picture-making machine is smashed, his eyes are a broken lens that reflects the sudden <br>destruction of the world. A red light flashes a final warning and the world goes to black. <br>
 <br>The viewer, audience and actor, looks for a while at the darkened screen, stirs in his <br>
easy chair, rubs his chin. He seems to be in some distress. Then, at last, he belches, and <br>reaches out and turns off the screen. <br>
