        left home and took a trip that brought him to a city in a country he'd 
        never seen before or even heard of.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3" color="black" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He arrived in the new city by train, perhaps, or plane. Or possibly even 
        by bus, though horseback could not to be entirely discounted. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3" color="black" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He walked around for a while, admiring the architecture. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3" color="black" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Toward evening, he went into a bar for a glass of wine. There was a man 
        drinking at the bar, a very large, well-dressed man with long, pointed 
        teeth. He also had small tusks protruding from his mouth. By this Denis 
        knew he was an ogre. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
        was a considerable knowledge of ogres where Denis came from. There were 
        different theories about them, but everyone warned against them. They 
        were considered dangerous. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Nice 
        day," the ogre said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes, 
        it is," Denis agreed, because he had been taught it was only politic to 
        be nice to ogres.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You're 
        new in this city," the ogre said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes, 
        I am."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Well, 
        it's my city. I own it. Every building and every person in it."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Wow," 
        Denis said politely, not quite knowing what else to say.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Would 
        you like to come to dinner?" the ogre said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Denis didn't, but knew you were never supposed to say no to an ogre. He 
        said he'd be delighted.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The ogre handed him a card on which was his address. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Then he said, "I suppose you've heard a lot of talk about ogres."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Well, 
        you know, just gossip."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        can tell you, we ogres are generally considered a fearsome lot. But we 
        are not without manners. You will be my guest at dinner not just for tonight 
        but for the next two nights."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That 
        is very kind of you."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We 
        ogres can be kind. There's a catch, of course, but it needn't worry you."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        is the catch?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"For 
        three nights I will provide your dinners. But if you are still here in 
        the city on the fourth night, you will be my dinner."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That 
        doesn't sound so good," Denis said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        said it needn't concern you. All you have to do is leave before the fourth 
        day is up."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's 
        really as simple as that?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Just 
        as simple as that. Good bye. See you tonight around seven pm. You'll have 
        no trouble finding my house"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Denis decided he was safe enough. He would stay this first day, dine with 
        the ogre in the evening, then leave in the morning.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He wandered around the city, went into a bar for a glass of wine, and 
        met the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She seemed taken with him, 
        too, and even bought him a drink. She had to leave suddenly, but told 
        him they would meet again.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He went to dinner that night at the Ogre's mansion, which he found without 
        even trying. The ogre was charming. The beautiful woman was there too, 
        she was a cousin of the ogre, and she seemed even more interested in Denis 
        than before. At the end of the meal, she gave him unmistakable signs that 
        he was to follow her. And the ogre gave him an invitation for the next 
        evening.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Denis followed the woman out into the street. He walked with her to her 
        home, but she wouldn't let him in. "</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I don't dare," she said. "My old boy friend has unexpectedly returned. 
        He is very jealous, so much so that he is likely to kill anyone he saw 
        with me."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Denis didn't like the sound of that. But she promised to take care of 
        everything, and assured him they would they get together soon. She kissed 
        him hastily and went into her house. Denis returned to his hotel room, 
        which the ogre had provided for him free. It was quite a decent hotel, 
        but not as nice as several others further down the block.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Next morning, he decided that although everyone was being nice, he really 
        ought to get out of this city, because his host after all, despite his 
        excellent manners and general air of sympathy, was a tusked and toothed 
        ogre. One night with the ogre was enough! Denis had been taught from childhood 
        to beware of ogres and to put no trust in them. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Time to go! He walked to the outskirts of the city, and set off in the 
        direction of the hills he could see faintly in the far distance. He walked 
        all day, through barren, scrubby lands. He had forgotten to take a lunch, 
        and so grew very hungry. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        By nightfall he was tired. He saw a building ahead. To his surprise, it 
        was the back of the ogre's mansion. The ogre was sitting in the garden, 
        in a deckchair, beside a fountain. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        hope you had a nice stroll,." The ogre said. "Now it is time for dinner."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Denis found this unpleasant and more than a little disquieting. Still, 
        he had two days left. He knew there was no real cause for alarm.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The dinner that second night was utterly splendid. There were guests, 
        and Denis listened to bright and intelligent talk. There were several 
        good-looking woman, though none so fine as the ogre's cousin, who was 
        also there. There was even an orchestra, and they were playing all his 
        favorite songs. He danced with the ogre's cousin and it was fine, utterly 
        fine. He was saddened when the leader told him the orchestra would be 
        back next week with an even finer program. Alas, he knew he would not 
        be there!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        That evening, the cousin was more flirtatious with him than before. She 
        even led him to a bedroom on the second floor. But although he was expecting 
        great things, he was sadly disappointed. When he timidly tried to take 
        her hand, she was astonished at his temerity. She just wanted to show 
        him some paintings she had done as a child. Some people thought they showed 
        promise... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        When he tried to kiss her, she evaded him. She was elusive but she told 
        him that she adored him. But there was a difficulty. She didn't tell him 
        what the difficulty was. Finally he returned alone to his hotel.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The next day was the third day, the last free day before becoming the 
        ogre's meal the day after. He decides he had better get going. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He walked through the city. On the way through the narrow streets he passed 
        a man in a tall white chef's hat, who grinned at him in a familiar way 
        but didn't speak. Denis continued walking. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Later he passed the ogre's mansion again--the place seemed to spring up 
        everywhere--and, as he went by, he heard screaming, and coarse laughter. 
        Peering in through the lower windows, he saw the kitchen, and the fellow 
        he saw earlier in the tall white hat was there, laughing, and he is clutching 
        some poor fellow and urging him toward a very large pot. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Denis realized that the terrified man was one of the guests from the previous 
        night. One who must have dined for three nights, and was to be dinner 
        the fourth.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He hurried away from the horrid sight, came to a beach at the end of the 
        city, and found a small sail boat on it. He pushed it into the sea and 
        set sail.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He sailed for many hours. He was out of sight of land, lost. He knew he 
        should have taken time to find a chart, so at least he'd know which direction 
        to sail in. Searching around the boat, he found a map in a locker. The 
        map indicated a direction, and gave instructions as to where a compass 
        was stored. He had a lot of trouble finding the compass--the locker it 
        was in had a tricky way of opening. It was evening and he saw a beach 
        ahead. He landed, and the ogre was there, sitting in a deck chair, smoking 
        a cigar.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        hope you enjoyed your sail on my pond," the ogre said. The boat was of 
        course free for anyone staying in the hotel. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The ogre reminded him of the invitation that night, and said that his 
        cousin is eager to see him again. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        How quickly the days have speeded by! Dinner tonight with the ogre, the 
        last one, and then the next day... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It was already apparent that whatever Denis did, he was going to wind 
        up in the city again on the fourth day, with the ogre. Obviously, the 
        ogre's domains were everywhere one could get to in this territory. If 
        he could neither walk out nor sail out, he wasn't likely to get out without 
        help, which he didn't think he'd find. Telling him he could go when he 
        liked was apparently a cruel joke on the ogre's part. But he still had 
        a day left. Was there somewhere he could hide where the ogre wouldn't 
        find him? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He thought of going underground. But he'd already seen, on the previous 
        day, that the kitchens were down there, and by the wails he heard, he 
        knew there were other people to whom the ogre had made the same offer. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He dined with the ogre that night, and the cousin was there, more flirtatious 
        than ever. When the ogre went to get another bottle of wine and they had 
        a chance alone, she breathlessly told him he was the only man for her, 
        and that she was determined they will marry next month. The youth didn't 
        think he'd live to see next month. He wanted to explain his situation, 
        but the ogre returned before he could tell her. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        She evaded him again at the end of the dinner, and Denis and returned 
        alone again to his hotel.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He spent the last safe day moping around and trying to think his position 
        through.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Suffice it to say that the evening of the fourth day arrived. Denis had 
        remembered a story his school teacher back home once told him. In one 
        of his discourses, the Buddha made a simile, asking if a dying man would 
        hold off treatment while he found out who poisoned him, and by what means.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Denis didn't know how this pertained to his case, but he thought maybe 
        it did, and he also thought the Buddha may have been wrong, or the story 
        wrongly ascribed to him. It seemed to the youth that sometimes you needed 
        to know what the disease was before you could make a treatment for it. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He wasn't sure what to make of this, but hoped something would come to 
        him. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        That night he went to the ogre for the fourth and final time.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The ogre led him to the dining room, and said, "At least we can have a 
        glass of wine together before the unpleasantness." The girl was not there. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"She 
        said she had another appointment," the ogre said.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Ah," 
        said Denis.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes, 
        it's a disappointment. She seems quite taken with you."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"She's 
        the loveliest thing I've ever seen."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes, 
        she is, isn't she? Doesn't get it from my side of the family!" The ogre 
        poured the wine. They drank. The ogre said, "As long as we're having a 
        drink, might as well have some snacks." Appetizers appeared. Then a main 
        course was brought on without explanation. Denis ate. The ogre seemed 
        disturbed about something. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The youth asked if something was wrong. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This 
        is a little embarrassing," the ogre says. "You remember that fellow in 
        the white hat who stared at you so rudely the other day? That was my head 
        cook who wanted to get an idea of your size before cooking you. Well, 
        everything was ready, the right size pot was procured, I was going to 
        have you parboiled with a white sauce--there's something fishy about you, 
        no insult intended--but then the wretched fellow had to fall ill. He can't 
        cook tonight. But he's planned it again, three days from now, and he swears 
        nothing will stand in the way. If necessary, if he's not well enough, 
        he will have his nephew slaughter and cook you, and make the white sauce. 
        The nephew is not as good a cook, but at least he's healthy and reliable. 
        This being the case, you might as well meet my cousin tomorrow. She wanted 
        you to know she'll be at the little bridge over the river at noon, and 
        she'd be delighted to see you." </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        thank you for your hospitality," Denis said. "But if you will release 
        me from your kingdom, I really think I'd like to be on my way. And you 
        can play your tricks on someone else. And that goes for your cousin, too. 
        By the way, I think I know your name now."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"How 
        did you figure it out?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        considered your characteristics. You are generous, but cruel. You do favors, 
        but in order for the recipient to feel greater loss thereafter. You are 
        the lord of confusion and ambiguity. Who would fit those characteristics? 
        Only Fear, which is your name."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Well, 
        you're right. I don't think I mentioned that if you guess my name, you 
        are free of me. But perhaps you'll agree there's a lot out there to fear."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No," 
        said Denis. "There's very little out there to fear. But a lot in here"--he 
        tapped his head--"there's a lot to fear. And you can tell your cousin 
        that I never want to see her again."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Do 
        you know her name, too?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Yes. 
        She is Disappointment."</font></p>
