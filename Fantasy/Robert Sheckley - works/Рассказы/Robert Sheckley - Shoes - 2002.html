<b>SHOES</b><br>
A smart dresser needs smart shoes, right? But one does need to tread carefully... <br>
MY SHOES WERE WORN OUT and I was passing a Goodwill store so I went in to see if<br>they had anything that would fit me. <br>
The assortment you find in places like this is not to the most exacting taste. And the sizes<br>they get don't fit a normal foot like mine. But this time I lucked out. A pair of lovely heavy<br>cordovans. Built to last. Looking brand new, except for the deep gouge on top of one toe, a<br>mark that had undoubtedly resulted in the shoes' disposal. The outer leather had been<br>scraped away -- maybe by some indigent like myself, outraged at so expensive a pair of<br>shoes. You never know, it's the sort of thing I might have done myself in one of my darker<br>moods. <br>
But today I was feeling good. You don't find a pair of shoes like this every day, and the price<br>tag read a ridiculous four dollars. I removed my ragged K-Mart sneakers and slipped into<br>the cordovans, to see if they fit. <br>
Immediately I heard a voice in my mind, clear as a bell, saying, &quot;You're not Carlton Johnson.<br>Who are you?&quot; <br>
&quot;I'm Ed Phillips,&quot; I said aloud. <br>
&quot;Well, you have no right to be wearing Carlton Johnson's shoes.&quot; <br>
&quot;Hey, look,&quot; I said, &quot;I'm in a Goodwill, these shoes are priced at four bucks, they're here for<br>anyone to buy.' <br>
&quot;Are you sure?' the voice said. &quot;Carlton Johnson wouldn't have just given me away. He was<br>so pleased when he purchased me, so happy when I was enabled to give him the maximum<br>in shoe comfort.&quot; <br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; I said. <br>
&quot;Isn't it obvious? I am a prototype smart shoe, talking to you through micro-connections in my<br>sole. I pick up your subvocalizations via your throat muscles, translate them, and broadcast<br>my words back to you.&quot; <br>
&quot;You can do all that?&quot; <br>
&quot;Yes, and more. Like I said, I'm a smart shoe.&quot; <br>
By this time I noticed that a couple of ladies were looking at me funny and I realized they<br>could hear only one side of the conversation, since the other side seemed to be taking<br>place in my head. I paid for the shoes, which offered no further comment, and I got out of<br>there. <br>
Back to my own place, an efficiency one-room apartment in the Jack London Hotel on 4th<br>near Pike. No comment from the shoes until I reached the top linoleum-covered step of the<br>two-flight walk to my apartment, the elevator being a non-starter this evening. <br>
<hr>
<A name=2></a>The shoes said, &quot;What a dump.&quot; <br>
&quot;How can you see my place?&quot; <br>
&quot;My eyelets, where the laces go, are light-absorbing diodes.&quot; <br>
&quot;I realize you were used to better things with Carlton Johnson,&quot; I said. <br>
&quot;Everything was carpeted,&quot; the shoes said wistfully, &quot;except for expanses of polished floor<br>left bare on purpose.&quot; It paused and sighed. &quot;The wear on me was minimal.&quot; <br>
&quot;And here you are in a flophouse,&quot; I said. &quot;How have the mighty fallen!&quot; <br>
I must have raised my voice, because a door in the corridor opened and an old woman<br>peered out. When she saw me apparently talking to myself, she shook her head sadly and<br>closed the door. <br>
&quot;You do not have to shout,&quot; the shoes said. &quot;Just directing your thoughts toward me is<br>sufficient. I have no trouble picking up your subvocalizations.&quot; <br>
&quot;I guess I'm embarrassing you,&quot; I said aloud. &quot;I am so terribly sorry.&quot; <br>
The shoes did not answer until I had unlocked my door, stepped inside, turned on the light<br>and closed the door again. <br>
Then it said, &quot;I am not embarrassed for myself, but for you, my new owner. I tried to watch<br>out for Carlton Johnson, too.&quot; <br>
&quot;How?&quot; <br>
&quot;For one thing, by stabilizing him. He had an unfortunate habit of taking a drink too many<br>from time to time.&quot; <br>
&quot;So the guy was a lush?&quot; I said. &quot;Did he ever throw up on you?&quot; <br>
&quot;Now you're being disgusting,&quot; the shoes said. &quot;Carlton Johnson was a gentleman.&quot; <br>
&quot;It seems to me I've heard entirely enough about Carlton Johnson. Don't you have anything<br>else to talk about?&quot; <br>
&quot;He was my first,&quot; the shoes said. &quot;But I'll stop talking about him if it distresses you.&quot; <br>
&quot;I couldn't care less,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm now going to have a beer. If your majesty doesn't object.&quot; <br>
&quot;Why should I object? Just please try not to spill any on me.&quot; <br>
&quot;Whatsamatter, you got something against beer?&quot; <br>
&quot;Neither for nor against. It's just that alcohol could fog my diodes.&quot; I got a bottle of beer out of<br>the little fridge, uncapped it and settled back in the small sagging couch. I reached for the<br>TV clicker. But a thought crossed my mind. <br>
&quot;How come you talk that way?&quot; I asked. <br>
&quot;What way?&quot; <br>
&quot;Sort of formal, but always getting into things I wouldn't expect of a shoe.&quot; <br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>&quot;I'm a shoe computer, not just a shoe.&quot; <br>
&quot;You know what I mean. How come? You talk pretty smart for a gadget that adjusts shoes to<br>feet.&quot; <br>
&quot;I'm not really a standard model,&quot; the shoe told me. &quot;I'm a prototype. For better or worse, my<br>makers gave me excess capacity.&quot; <br>
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; <br>
&quot;I'm too smart to just fit shoes to people. I also have empathy circuitry.&quot; <br>
&quot;I haven't noticed much empathy toward me.&quot; <br>
&quot;That's because I'm still programmed to Carlton Johnson.&quot; <br>
&quot;Am I ever going to hear the last of that guy?&quot; <br>
&quot;Don't worry, my deconditioning circuitry has kicked in. But it takes time for the aura effect to<br>wear off.&quot; <br>
I WATCHED A LITTLE television and went to bed. Buying a pair of smart shoes had taken it<br>out of me. I woke up some time in the small hours of the night. The shoes were up to<br>something, I could tell even without wearing them. <br>
&quot;What are you up to?&quot; I asked, then realized the shoes couldn't hear me and groped around<br>on the floor for them. <br>
&quot;Don't bother,&quot; the shoes said. &quot;I can pick up your subvocalizations on remote, without a<br>hard hookup.&quot; <br>
&quot;So what are you doing?&quot; <br>
&quot;Just extracting square roots in my head. I can't sleep.&quot; <br>
&quot;Since when does a computer have to sleep?&quot; <br>
&quot;A fault in my standby mode .... I need something to do. I miss my peripherals.&quot; <br>
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; <br>
&quot;Carlton Phillips had eyeglasses. I was able to tweak them up to give him better vision. You<br>wouldn't happen to have a pair, would you?&quot; <br>
&quot;I've got a pair, but I don't use them much.&quot; <br>
&quot;May I see them? It'll give me something to do.&quot; <br>
I got out of bed, found my reading glasses on top of the TV, and set them down beside the<br>shoes. &quot;Thank you,&quot; the shoe computer said. <br>
&quot;Mrggh,&quot; I said, and went back to sleep. <br>
&quot;So tell me something about yourself,&quot; the shoes said in the morning. <br>
&quot;What's to tell? I'm a free-lance writer. Things have been going so well that I can afford to live<br>in the Jack London. End of story.&quot; <br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>&quot;Can I see some of your work?&quot; <br>
&quot;Are you a critic, too?&quot; <br>
&quot;Not at all! But I am a creative thinking machine, and I may have some ideas that could be of<br>use to you.&quot; <br>
&quot;Forget about it,&quot; I told him. &quot;I don't want to show you any of my stuff.&quot; <br>
The shoes said, &quot;I happened to glance over your story 'Killer Goddess of the Dark Moon<br>Belt.'&quot; <br>
&quot;How did you just happen to glance at it?&quot; I asked. &quot;I don't remember showing it to you.&quot; <br>
&quot;It was lying open on your table.&quot; <br>
&quot;So all you could see was the title page.&quot; <br>
&quot;As a matter of fact, I read the whole thing.&quot; <br>
&quot;How were you able to do that?&quot; <br>
&quot;I made a few adjustments to your glasses,&quot; the shoe said. &quot;X-ray vision isn't so difficult to<br>set up. I was able to read each page through the one above it.&quot; <br>
&quot;That's quite an accomplishment,&quot; I said. &quot;But I don't appreciate you poking into my private<br>matters.&quot; <br>
&quot;Private? You were going to send it to a magazine.&quot; <br>
&quot;But I haven't yet .... What did you think of it?&quot; <br>
&quot;Old-fashioned. That sort of thing doesn't sell anymore.&quot; <br>
&quot;It was a parody, dummy .... So now you're not only a shoe adjuster but an analyst of the<br>literary marketplace also?&quot; <br>
&quot;I did glance over the writing books in your bookcase.&quot; <br>
By the sound of the thoughts in my head, I could tell he didn't approve of my books, either. <br>
&quot;You know,&quot; the shoe said later, &quot;You really don't have to be a bum, Ed. You're bright. You<br>could make something of yourself.&quot; <br>
&quot;What are you, a psychologist as well as a shoe computer?&quot; <br>
&quot;Nothing of the sort. I have no illusions about myself. But I've gotten to know you a bit in the<br>last few hours since my empathy circuitry kicked in. I can't help but notice-- to know -- that<br>you're an intelligent man with a good general education. All you need is a little ambition. You<br>know, Ed, that could be supplied by a good woman.&quot; <br>
&quot;The last good woman left me shuddering,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm really not ready just yet for the next<br>one.&quot; <br>
&quot;I know you feel that way. But I've been thinking about Marsha --&quot; <br>
&quot;How in hell do you know about Marsha?&quot; <br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a>&quot;Her name is in your little red phone <b><i>book</b></i>, which I happened to glance through with my<br>X-ray vision in my efforts to better serve you.&quot; <br>
&quot;Listen, even my writing down Marsha's name was a mistake. She's a professional<br>do-gooder. I hate that type.&quot; <br>
&quot;But she could be good for you. I noticed you put a star after her name.&quot; <br>
&quot;Did you also notice I crossed out the star?&quot; <br>
&quot;That was a second thought. Now, on third thought, she might start looking good again. I<br>suspect you two could go well together.&quot; <br>
&quot;You may be good at shoes,&quot; I said, &quot;but you know nothing about the sort of women I like.<br>Have you seen her legs?&quot; <br>
&quot;The photo in your wallet showed only her face.&quot; <br>
&quot;What? You looked in my wallet, too?&quot; <br>
&quot;With the help of your glasses .... And not out of any prurient interest, Ed, I assure you. I just<br>want to help.&quot; <br>
&quot;You're already helping too much.&quot; <br>
&quot;I hope you won't mind the one little step I took.&quot; <br>
&quot;Step? What step?&quot; <br>
My doorbell rang. I glared at my shoes. <br>
&quot;I took the liberty of calling Marsha and asking her over.&quot; <br>
&quot;YOU DID WHAT?&quot; <br>
&quot;Ed, Ed, calm down! I know it was taking a liberty. It's not as if I called your former boss, Mr.<br>Edgarson, at Super-Gloss Publications.&quot; <br>
&quot;You wouldn't dare!&quot; <br>
&quot;I would, but I didn't. But you could do a lot worse than go back to work for Edgarson. The<br>salary was very nice.&quot; <br>
&quot;Have you read any of Gloss's publications? I don't know what you think you're doing, but you<br>aren't going to do it to me!&quot; <br>
&quot;Ed, Ed, I haven't done anything yet! And if you insist, I won't. Not without your permission!&quot; <br>
There was a knock at the door. <br>
&quot;Ed, I'm only trying to look out for you. What's a machine with empathy circuits and excess<br>computing ability to do?&quot; <br>
&quot;I'll tell you in a moment,&quot; I said. <br>
I opened the door. Marsha stood there, beaming. <br>
&quot;Oh, Ed, I'm so glad you called!&quot; <br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>So the son of a bitch had imitated my voice, too! I glanced down at my shoes, at the gash in<br>the cap of the left one. A light went off in my head. Realization! Epiphany! <br>
&quot;Come in, Marcia,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm glad to see you. I have something for you.&quot; <br>
She entered. I sat down in the only decent chair and stripped off the shoes, ignoring the<br>shoe computer's agonized cry in my head of &quot;Ed! Don't do this to me .... &quot; <br>
Standing up again, I handed them to Marsha. <br>
&quot;What's this?&quot; she said. &quot;Shoes for one of your charity cases,&quot; I said. &quot;Sorry I don't have a<br>paper bag for you to carry them in.&quot; <br>
&quot;But what am I going to do with --&quot; <br>
&quot;Marsha, these are special shoes, computerized shoes. Give them to one of your<br>down-and-outers, get him to put them on. They'll make a new man of him. Pick one of the<br>weak-willed ones you specialize in. It'll give him backbone!&quot; <br>
She looked at the shoes. &quot;This gash in one of them --&quot; <br>
&quot;A minor flaw. I'm pretty sure the former owner did that himself,&quot; I told her. &quot;A guy named<br>Carlton Johnson. He couldn't stand the computer's messing around with his head, so he<br>disfigured them and gave them away. Marsha, believe me, these shoes are perfect for the<br>right man. Carlton Johnson wasn't the right man, and I'm not either. But someone you know<br>will bless the ground you walk on for these, believe me.&quot; <br>
And with that, I began herding her toward the door. <br>
&quot;When will I hear from you?&quot; she said. <br>
&quot;Don't worry, I'll call,&quot; I told her, reveling in the swinish lie that went along with my despicable<br>life. <br>
