SIGHTSEEING, 2179<br>
WELL-MEANING FRIENDS HAD advised K to exercise caution on this trip to Venice. Considering<br>the fragile state of his health, it would require the utmost caution on his part to come out of this all right. In<br>fact, considering the inevitable strain of the journey and the dislocations attendant on any holiday in<br>foreign parts, and also adding in the constant temptation to augment his mind receptivity in order to get<br>the most out of the experience, it would be best not to go to Venice at all, not to leave Brooklyn, where<br>he had immediate access to the finest medical treatment. To stay at home was the only way of playing it<br>safe. And after all, he had visited Venice once, many years ago. It was natural to want to repeat a peak<br>experience. But he did have his health to consider.<br>Nor would he necessarily lose by staying home. His friend Mortimer Gould had offered him exclusive<br>access to Gould's own memories of Venice, which he had registered as recently as last year. Gould's<br>memories were fresh, and he had spent two weeks in the city and had seen everything. K could connect<br>to these memories in the comfort of his own home, or even in a hospital setting, if that seemed the wise<br>thing to do, and all this at his leisure, with plenty of time for breaks, refreshments, naps, even for<br>professional moment-to-moment monitoring of his state of health.<br>K had thanked Gould courteously, but had insisted on going to Venice himself, in his own failing body.<br>He knew it might be the last time, and he was determined to relive his own memories while he still had the<br>chance, to restimulate them with one more look at the real thing, one final visit to a dearly loved city. This<br>had become urgent to him as his state of health declined and the time he had left to live grew increasingly<br>uncertain.<br>And so he had followed his own decision and taken the flight to Marco Polo airport, and now he was on<br>the Grand Canal of Venice in a water bus, a vaporetto, prepared to store in his memories enough to last<br>whatever time he had left, store them and replay them in his small apartment on Stone Street in Brooklyn.<br>But would he ever get back to Brooklyn? That seemed in some doubt, though he tried to assure himself<br>otherwise. But in any event, what did it matter? Memories were not just for the sake of the replaying.<br>These memories, which he was stimulating and re- enhancing, were the closest he could come to<br>recapturing something infinitely precious but unnameable, indefinable. And that was as it should be,<br>because the essence of life was not to be won like a prize in a shooting gallery.<br>It was August of the year 2179. The life of individuals and of nations was the best it had ever been.<br>Major wars were a thing of the past. Even minor conflicts nowadays were quickly and judiciously settled<br>by international tribunals with enforcement powers supplied to them by most of the nations of the world.<br>The birthrate had leveled out at an acceptable level. The impoverishment of the world's resources had<br>been arrested, even put modestly into reverse. The Greenhouse Effect had been turned back. Species on<br>the verge of extinction were making a comeback. The ozone layers had returned. Plankton was coming<br>back, and with it all other fish. Bison now roamed America's greatly expanded state and national parks.<br>Wolves were firmly entrenched. The bald eagle needed no longer to fear chemicals. Substitutes for dams<br>had been found, and salmon could now swim upstream to their spawning places. The list went on and on.<br>Medically, it had been a stirring time. AIDS had been all but eradicated. No other plague or virus<br>threatened. Psychologically, great strides had been made. The brain technicians had learned how to put a<br>man in charge of the controls of his own mind. Now, with proper training, a man could dial up his<br>sensations when he wanted to, or dial them down to subsistence level when it was a matter of just<br>standing around waiting.<br>The success of the Genome Program, though too late for some, had proven a spur to the science of<br>longevity. People now lived longer, and in better health, than ever before. But men still died. No matter<br>how good life was, or how long it lasted, it came at last to an end. One day you heard the fat lady sing<br>and you knew the words were, that's all she wrote, folks.<br>
<hr>
<A name=2></a>The very pleasantness of life made it more than usually bitter to leave it. But if you had to go, at least you<br>had some choice in the manner of your departure. If you've got to go out, better to go out with a bang, K<br>reasoned.<br>Following this line of thinking, K had no difficulty convincing himself that he had to visit Venice one last<br>time, if not because he was up for it then because he was not up for it. At least he could give himself one<br>last fling no matter what the price.<br>
HE THOUGHT OF THIS staring at the young girls who leaned out over the Rialto Bridge, waving, not<br>to him, perhaps, but to the man he once had been.<br>The vaporetto pulled up to a dock and came to a stop, the barrier was pulled back, a crowd pushed off,<br>another crowd pushed on. Secure in his front seat, at the boat's front left hand side, K took it all in. His<br>Brooklyn memories, like old rotogravures, blazed up for a moment: his grandfather's pushcart, the smell<br>of freshly ground coffee in the small three-room apartment, the hard slick feeling of the sofa stuffed with<br>horsehair. Then those memories faded and the images of Venice past and present rose up in his mind.<br>The old memories were splendid, but they were overshadowed by the new images that crossed his mind<br>-- there at the Accademia Bridge with Santa Maria Salute coming up in the background.<br>It was an important moment, but he wanted to feel it more powerfully. With a mental command he<br>stepped up the intensity dial on his interior controls.<br>His doctor had warned him against doing this. &quot;Take this trip if you must. But don't play with your internal<br>mechanisms. There's a price to be paid for everything, you know, and this mental ability that man has<br>available now, this access to his interior engineering that permits a man to augment his acuity, is all very<br>well, but it comes at a price. Our bodies follow an ancient design. Our physiological systems were not<br>built to permit the ravishing of our senses made possible by our inner controls. Oh, a young man can get<br>away with it for a while, but yours, even with the enhancements of medical technology, is an old model of<br>an ancient design. I know, you want to live like a god once more. But remember, K, your body won't<br>stand for it. Be patient, be prudent, enjoy the good without insisting on the superlative.&quot;<br>Good advice, no doubt of it, and K, despite the bravado of his thoughts, had had every intention of<br>following it.<br>Just to see Venice again, he had told himself, that was enough. But now, at this moment, in the gently<br>rocking vaporetto, warm air rising from the lagoon, blue sky overhead, the indescribable buildings of<br>Venice approaching slowly, like stately figures in a dance, K threw all caution to the winds. He stepped<br>up the intensity again, and when he felt his heart balking at this psychic overload, he overrode it, his spirit<br>floating on top of it, young and vibrant again, a godlike human whose apprehension was unlimited, no<br>longer bound by Hamlet's doubt or Lear's bitterness.<br>&quot;Once more into the breach, brave friends,&quot; he said aloud.<br>A few people glanced at him curiously, then turned away. A man was still permitted to talk to himself for<br>no apparent reason, even in this enlightened day and age.<br>And what if they did think he was crazy? K didn't care. He was feeling wonderful. At that moment he<br>was where he should have been if his species had been better designed. The music from the orchestra in<br>front of Florian's rose in a triumph of heavenly harmonies, and he saw a one-armed gondolier poling his<br>boat across the smooth waters in perfect harmony, saw a straw hat floating in a little side canal in solitary<br>glory, saw a single white cloud of tremulous promise drift across the impossibly blue sky like a detail in a<br>stage-setting.<br>Floating in the wonder of enhanced receptivity, he watched the spectacle of distant buildings seen through<br>arched openings. These buildings seemed to float on the water, colored in hues that began to fade even<br>as he looked at them.<br>Still entranced, he left the vaporetto and walked through narrow streets and across hump-backed<br>bridges, still in an ecstasy. But his pleasure began to give way to a pain in his legs, chronic,<br>attention-getting, which he suppressed by mental directive. And then there was the pounding of his heart,<br>which he suppressed by mental commend. He did this in order to fully appreciate a foreign woman in a<br>Donald Duck T-shirt toss long bronze-colored hair out of her eyes. After that he was eating a pizza with<br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>false teeth made whole by determination alone, and then he was walking among the pigeons strutting with<br>impunity along the cobblestones, and after that he was watching a child at a kiosk try on a golden carnival<br>mask of papier-mâché.<br>At that point he knew he had won a victory over time and illness and loss, won it and still was living. It<br>was time to let up, slow down, retreat from the exhilarating and dangerous heights he had attained, calm<br>down, accept the pain again, get to the train station, find a taxi, get to a hotel room, or, better, to a<br>hospital.<br>That would have been the wise thing to do. But the godlike being he had created or resurrected inside<br>himself, the all-devouring god of memory who accepted no boundaries, refused to accept the inevitable<br>anticlimax of a return to his mortal state. On the one side was his doctor's warning, backed up by the<br>frugal wisdom of science, which saw each moment mainly as an opportunity to live the next. On the other<br>side he heard mad Nietzsche's voice, speaking as Zarathustra, saying, &quot;Die at the right time.&quot;<br>If a man had to die, what better way to go than at the height of his powers, flooded with brilliant vision?<br>One small part of him regretted only the inconvenience he would be causing others as his body refused<br>any longer to accept the insult or the grace from the overload he was giving it. He collapsed to the<br>pavement.<br>He was leaving a mess, but he couldn't help it. It was inevitable that in a world built for the living, dying<br>should be an inconvenience to others. But to a man dying, death should be a triumph and a glorious<br>summation of all the best acts, visions, and nuances of his existence, blazing forth now as he descended<br>into the dark mystery that alone made life worth living.<br>
