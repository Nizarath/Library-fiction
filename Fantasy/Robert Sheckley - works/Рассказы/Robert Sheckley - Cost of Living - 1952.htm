<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Carrin</span> decided that he
could trace his present
mood to Miller's suicide
last week. But the knowledge
didn't help him get rid of the
vague, formless fear in the back
of his mind. It was foolish. Miller's
suicide didn't concern him.</p>

<p>But why had that fat, jovial
man killed himself? Miller had
had everything to live for&mdash;wife,
kids, good job, and all the marvelous
luxuries of the age. Why
had he done it?</p>

<p>"Good morning, dear," Carrin's
wife said as he sat down at
the breakfast table.</p>

<p>"Morning, honey. Morning,
Billy."</p>

<p>His son grunted something.</p>

<p>You just couldn't tell about
people, Carrin decided, and dialed
his breakfast. The meal was
gracefully prepared and served
by the new Avignon Electric Auto-cook.</p>

<p>His mood persisted, annoyingly
enough since Carrin wanted to
be in top form this morning. It
was his day off, and the Avignon
Electric finance man was coming.
This was an important day.</p>

<p>He walked to the door with his
son.</p>

<p>"Have a good day, Billy."</p>

<p>His son nodded, shifted his
books and started to school without
answering. Carrin wondered
if something was bothering him,
too. He hoped not. One worrier
in the family was plenty.</p>

<p>"See you later, honey." He
kissed his wife as she left to go
shopping.</p>

<p>At any rate, he thought, watching
her go down the walk, at
least she's happy. He wondered
how much she'd spend at the
A. E. store.</p>

<p>Checking his watch, he found
that he had half an hour before
the A. E. finance man was due.
The best way to get rid of a bad
mood was to drown it, he told
himself, and headed for the
shower.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> shower room was a glittering
plastic wonder, and the
sheer luxury of it eased Carrin's
mind. He threw his clothes into
the A. E. automatic Kleen-presser,
and adjusted the shower spray
to a notch above "brisk." The
five-degrees-above-skin-temperature
water beat against his thin
white body. Delightful! And then
a relaxing rub-dry in the A. E.
Auto-towel.</p>

<p>Wonderful, he thought, as the
towel stretched and kneaded his
stringy muscles. And it should be
wonderful, he reminded himself.
The A. E. Auto-towel with shaving
attachments had cost three
hundred and thirteen dollars, plus
tax.</p>

<p>But worth every penny of it,
he decided, as the A. E. shaver
came out of a corner and whisked
off his rudimentary stubble.
After all, what good was life if
you couldn't enjoy the luxuries?</p>

<p>His skin tingled when he
switched off the Auto-towel. He
should have been feeling wonderful,
but he wasn't. Miller's suicide
kept nagging at his mind,
destroying the peace of his day
off.</p>

<p>Was there anything else bothering
him? Certainly there was
nothing wrong with the house.
His papers were in order for the
finance man.</p>

<p>"Have I forgotten something?"
he asked out loud.</p>

<p>"The Avignon Electric finance
man will be here in fifteen minutes,"
his A. E. bathroom Wall-reminder
whispered.</p>

<p>"I know that. Is there anything
else?"</p>

<p>The Wall-reminder reeled off
its memorized data&mdash;a vast
amount of minutiae about watering
the lawn, having the Jet-lash
checked, buying lamb chops for
Monday, and the like. Things he
still hadn't found time for.</p>

<p>"All right, that's enough." He
allowed the A. E. Auto-dresser to
dress him, skillfully draping a
new selection of fabrics over his
bony frame. A whiff of fashionable
masculine perfume finished
him and he went into the living
room, threading his way between
the appliances that lined the
walls.</p>

<p>A quick inspection of the dials
on the wall assured him that the
house was in order. The breakfast
dishes had been sanitized and
stacked, the house had been
cleaned, dusted, polished, his
wife's garments had been hung
up, his son's model rocket ships
had been put back in the closet.</p>

<p>Stop worrying, you hypochondriac,
he told himself angrily.</p>

<p>The door announced, "Mr.
Pathis from Avignon Finance is
here."</p>

<p>Carrin started to tell the door
to open, when he noticed the Automatic
Bartender.</p>

<p>Good God, why hadn't he
thought of it!</p>

<p>The Automatic Bartender was
manufactured by Castile Motors.
He had bought it in a weak moment.
A. E. wouldn't think very
highly of that, since they sold
their own brand.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> wheeled the bartender into
the kitchen, and told the
door to open.</p>

<p>"A very good day to you, sir,"
Mr. Pathis said.</p>

<p>Pathis was a tall, imposing
man, dressed in a conservative
tweed drape. His eyes had the
crinkled corners of a man who
laughs frequently. He beamed
broadly and shook Carrin's hand,
looking around the crowded living
room.</p>

<p>"A beautiful place you have
here, sir. Beautiful! As a matter
of fact, I don't think I'll be overstepping
the company's code to
inform you that yours is the
nicest interior in this section."</p>

<p>Carrin felt a sudden glow of
pride at that, thinking of the
rows of identical houses, on this
block and the next, and the one
after that.</p>

<p>"Now, then, is everything functioning
properly?" Mr. Pathis
asked, setting his briefcase on a
chair. "Everything in order?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Carrin said enthusiastically.
"Avignon Electric never
goes out of whack."</p>

<p>"The phone all right? Changes
records for the full seventeen
hours?"</p>

<p>"It certainly does," Carrin
said. He hadn't had a chance to
try out the phone, but it was a
beautiful piece of furniture.</p>

<p>"The Solido-projector all right?
Enjoying the programs?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely perfect reception."
He had watched a program just
last month, and it had been startlingly
lifelike.</p>

<p>"How about the kitchen? Auto-cook
in order? Recipe-master
still knocking 'em out?"</p>

<p>"Marvelous stuff. Simply marvelous."</p>

<p>Mr. Pathis went on to inquire
about his refrigerator, his vacuum
cleaner, his car, his
helicopter, his subterranean swimming
pool, and the hundreds of
other items Carrin had bought
from Avignon Electric.</p>

<p>"Everything is swell," Carrin
said, a trifle untruthfully since
he hadn't unpacked every item
yet. "Just wonderful."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," Mr. Pathis said,
leaning back with a sigh of relief.
"You have no idea how hard we
try to satisfy our customers. If
a product isn't right, back it
comes, no questions asked. We
believe in pleasing our customers."</p>

<p>"I certainly appreciate it, Mr.
Pathis."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Carrin</span> hoped the A. E. man
wouldn't ask to see the kitchen.
He visualized the Castile
Motors Bartender in there, like
a porcupine in a dog show.</p>

<p>"I'm proud to say that most of
the people in this neighborhood
buy from us," Mr. Pathis was
saying. "We're a solid firm."</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Miller a customer of
yours?" Carrin asked.</p>

<p>"That fellow who killed himself?"
Pathis frowned briefly.
"He was, as a matter of fact.
That amazed me, sir, absolutely
amazed me. Why, just last month
the fellow bought a brand-new
Jet-lash from me, capable of doing
three hundred and fifty miles
an hour on a straightaway. He
was as happy as a kid over it,
and then to go and do a thing
like that! Of course, the Jet-lash
brought up his debt a little."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"But what did that matter?
He had every luxury in the world.
And then he went and hung himself."</p>

<p>"Hung himself?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Pathis said, the frown
coming back. "Every modern
convenience in his house, and he
hung himself with a piece of rope.
Probably unbalanced for a long
time."</p>

<p>The frown slid off his face, and
the customary smile replaced it.
"But enough of that! Let's talk
about you."</p>

<p>The smile widened as Pathis
opened his briefcase. "Now, then,
your account. You owe us two
hundred and three thousand dollars
and twenty-nine cents, Mr.
Carrin, as of your last purchase.
Right?"</p>

<p>"Right," Carrin said, remembering
the amount from his own
papers. "Here's my installment."</p>

<p>He handed Pathis an envelope,
which the man checked and put
in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Fine. Now you know, Mr.
Carrin, that you won't live long
enough to pay us the full two
hundred thousand, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose I will,"
Carrin said soberly.</p>

<p>He was only thirty-nine, with
a full hundred years of life before
him, thanks to the marvels
of medical science. But at a salary
of three thousand a year, he
still couldn't pay it all off and
have enough to support a family
on at the same time.</p>

<p>"Of course, we would not want
to deprive you of necessities,
which in any case is fully protected
by the laws we helped
formulate and pass. To say nothing
of the terrific items that are
coming out next year. Things
you wouldn't want to miss, sir!"</p>

<p>Mr. Carrin nodded. Certainly
he wanted new items.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose we make the
customary arrangement. If you
will just sign over your son's
earnings for the first thirty years
of his adult life, we can easily
arrange credit for you."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Mr.</span> Pathis whipped the papers
out of his briefcase and
spread them in front of Carrin.</p>

<p>"If you'll just sign here, sir."</p>

<p>"Well," Carrin said, "I'm not
sure. I'd like to give the boy a
start in life, not saddle him
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But my dear sir," Pathis interposed,
"this is for your son as
well. He lives here, doesn't he?
He has a right to enjoy the luxuries,
the marvels of science."</p>

<p>"Sure," Carrin said. "Only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, today the average
man is living like a king. A
hundred years ago the richest
man in the world couldn't buy
what any ordinary citizen possesses
at present. You mustn't
look upon it as a debt. It's an
investment."</p>

<p>"That's true," Carrin said dubiously.</p>

<p>He thought about his son and
his rocket ship models, his star
charts, his maps. Would it be
right? he asked himself.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Pathis asked
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Well, I was just wondering,"
Carrin said. "Signing over my
son's earnings&mdash;you don't think
I'm getting in a little too deep,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Too deep? My dear sir!"
Pathis exploded into laughter.
"Do you know Mellon down the
block? Well, don't say I said it,
but he's already mortgaged his
grandchildren's salary for their
full life-expectancy! And he
doesn't have half the goods he's
made up his mind to own! We'll
work out something for him.
Service to the customer is our job
and we know it well."</p>

<p>Carrin wavered visibly.</p>

<p>"And after you're gone, sir,
they'll all belong to your son."</p>

<p>That was true, Carrin thought.
His son would have all the marvelous
things that filled the
house. And after all, it was only
thirty years out of a life expectancy
of a hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>He signed with a flourish.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" Pathis said. "And
by the way, has your home got
an A. E. Master-operator?"</p>

<p>It hadn't. Pathis explained that
a Master-operator was new this
year, a stupendous advance in
scientific engineering. It was
designed to take over all the functions
of housecleaning and cooking,
without its owner having to
lift a finger.</p>

<p>"Instead of running around all
day, pushing half a dozen different
buttons, with the Master-operator
all you have to do is
push <i>one</i>! A remarkable achievement!"</p>

<p>Since it was only five hundred
and thirty-five dollars, Carrin
signed for one, having it added
to his son's debt.</p>

<p>Right's right, he thought, walking
Pathis to the door. This house
will be Billy's some day. His and
his wife's. They certainly will
want everything up-to-date.</p>

<p>Just one button, he thought.
That <i>would</i> be a time-saver!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">After</span> Pathis left, Carrin sat
back in an adjustable chair
and turned on the solido. After
twisting the Ezi-dial, he discovered
that there was nothing he
wanted to see. He tilted back the
chair and took a nap.</p>

<p>The something on his mind was
still bothering him.</p>

<p>"Hello, darling!" He awoke to
find his wife was home. She kissed
him on the ear. "Look."</p>

<p>She had bought an A. E. Sexitizer-negligee.
He was pleasantly
surprised that that was all she
had bought. Usually, Leela returned
from shopping laden
down.</p>

<p>"It's lovely," he said.</p>

<p>She bent over for a kiss, then
giggled&mdash;a habit he knew she had
picked up from the latest popular
solido star. He wished she hadn't.</p>

<p>"Going to dial supper," she
said, and went to the kitchen.
Carrin smiled, thinking that soon
she would be able to dial the
meals without moving out of the
living room. He settled back in
his chair, and his son walked in.</p>

<p>"How's it going, Son?" he
asked heartily.</p>

<p>"All right," Billy answered listlessly.</p>

<p>"What'sa matter, Son?" The
boy stared at his feet, not answering.
"Come on, tell Dad what's
the trouble."</p>

<p>Billy sat down on a packing
case and put his chin in his hands.
He looked thoughtfully at his
father.</p>

<p>"Dad, could I be a Master Repairman
if I wanted to be?"</p>

<p>Mr. Carrin smiled at the question.
Billy alternated between
wanting to be a Master Repairman
and a rocket pilot. The
repairmen were the elite. It was
their job to fix the automatic repair
machines. The repair machines
could fix just about
anything, but you couldn't have
a machine fix the machine that
fixed the machine. That was
where the Master Repairmen
came in.</p>

<p>But it was a highly competitive
field and only a very few of the
best brains were able to get their
degrees. And, although the boy
was bright, he didn't seem to have
an engineering bent.</p>

<p>"It's possible, Son. Anything is
possible."</p>

<p>"But is it possible for me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Carrin answered,
as honestly as he could.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to be a
Master Repairman anyway," the
boy said, seeing that the answer
was no. "I want to be a space
pilot."</p>

<p>"A space pilot, Billy?" Leela
asked, coming in to the room.
"But there aren't any."</p>

<p>"Yes, there are," Billy argued.
"We were told in school that the
government is going to send some
men to Mars."</p>

<p>"They've been saying that for
a hundred years," Carrin said,
"and they still haven't gotten
around to doing it."</p>

<p>"They will this time."</p>

<p>"Why would you want to go to
Mars?" Leela asked, winking at
Carrin. "There are no pretty girls
on Mars."</p>

<p>"I'm not interested in girls. I
just want to go to Mars."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like it, honey,"
Leela said. "It's a nasty old place
with no air."</p>

<p>"It's got some air. I'd like to
go there," the boy insisted sullenly.
"I don't like it here."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Carrin asked,
sitting up straight. "Is there anything
you haven't got? Anything
you want?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I've got everything I
want." Whenever his son called
him 'sir,' Carrin knew that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>"Look, Son, when I was your
age I wanted to go to Mars, too.
I wanted to do romantic things.
I even wanted to be a Master
Repairman."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I grew up. I realized
that there were more important
things. First I had to pay off the
debt my father had left me, and
then I met your mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>Leela giggled.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and I wanted a home of my
own. It'll be the same with you.
You'll pay off your debt and get
married, the same as the rest of
us."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Billy</span> was silent for a while,
then he brushed his dark hair&mdash;straight,
like his father's&mdash;back
from his forehead and wet his
lips.</p>

<p>"How come I have debts, sir?"</p>

<p>Carrin explained carefully.
About the things a family needed
for civilized living, and the cost
of those items. How they had to
be paid. How it was customary
for a son to take on a part of his
parent's debt, when he came of
age.</p>

<p>Billy's silence annoyed him. It
was almost as if the boy were reproaching
him. After he had
slaved for years to give the ungrateful
whelp every luxury!</p>

<p>"Son," he said harshly, "have
you studied history in school?
Good. Then you know how it
was in the past. Wars. How would
you like to get blown up in a
war?"</p>

<p>The boy didn't answer.</p>

<p>"Or how would you like to
break your back for eight hours
a day, doing work a machine
should handle? Or be hungry all
the time? Or cold, with the rain
beating down on you, and no
place to sleep?"</p>

<p>He paused for a response, got
none and went on. "You live in
the most fortunate age mankind
has ever known. You are surrounded
by every wonder of art
and science. The finest music, the
greatest books and art, all at your
fingertips. All you have to do is
push a button." He shifted to a
kindlier tone. "Well, what are
you thinking?"</p>

<p>"I was just wondering how I
could go to Mars," the boy said.
"With the debt, I mean. I don't
suppose I could get away from
that."</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"Unless I stowed away on a
rocket."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't do that."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," the boy
said, but his tone lacked conviction.</p>

<p>"You'll stay here and marry a
very nice girl," Leela told him.</p>

<p>"Sure I will," Billy said.
"Sure." He grinned suddenly. "I
didn't mean any of that stuff
about going to Mars. I really
didn't."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," Leela
answered.</p>

<p>"Just forget I mentioned it,"
Billy said, smiling stiffly. He
stood up and raced upstairs.</p>

<p>"Probably gone to play with
his rockets," Leela said. "He's
such a little devil."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Carrins ate a quiet supper,
and then it was time for Mr.
Carrin to go to work. He was on
night shift this month. He kissed
his wife good-by, climbed into
his Jet-lash and roared to the
factory. The automatic gates recognized
him and opened. He
parked and walked in.</p>

<p>Automatic lathes, automatic
presses&mdash;everything was automatic.
The factory was huge and
bright, and the machines hummed
softly to themselves, doing
their job and doing it well.</p>

<p>Carrin walked to the end of
the automatic washing machine
assembly line, to relieve the man
there.</p>

<p>"Everything all right?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Sure," the man said. "Haven't
had a bad one all year. These
new models here have built-in
voices. They don't light up like
the old ones."</p>

<p>Carrin sat down where the man
had sat and waited for the first
washing machine to come
through. His job was the soul of
simplicity. He just sat there and
the machines went by him. He
pressed a button on them and
found out if they were all right.
They always were. After passing
him, the washing machines went
to the packaging section.</p>

<p>The first one slid by on the
long slide of rollers. He pressed
the starting button on the side.</p>

<p>"Ready for the wash," the
washing machine said.</p>

<p>Carrin pressed the release and
let it go by.</p>

<p>That boy of his, Carrin
thought. Would he grow up and
face his responsibilities? Would
he mature and take his place in
society? Carrin doubted it. The
boy was a born rebel. If anyone
got to Mars, it would be his kid.</p>

<p>But the thought didn't especially
disturb him.</p>

<p>"Ready for the wash." Another
machine went by.</p>

<p>Carrin remembered something
about Miller. The jovial man had
always been talking about the
planets, always kidding about
going off somewhere and roughing
it. He hadn't, though. He'd
committed suicide.</p>

<p>"Ready for the wash."</p>

<p>Carrin had eight hours in front
of him, and he loosened his belt
to prepare for it. Eight hours of
pushing buttons and listening to
a machine announce its readiness.</p>

<p>"Ready for the wash."</p>

<p>He pressed the release.</p>

<p>"Ready for the wash."</p>

<p>Carrin's mind strayed from the
job, which didn't need much attention
in any case. He wished
he had done what he had longed
to do as a youngster.</p>

<p>It would have been great to be
a rocket pilot, to push a button
and go to Mars.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
