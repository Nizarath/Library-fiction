        <font size="3">Illustration by Scott L. </font></font></font></p>
      <p align=left>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Chris 
        was in the grip of a great flood of feeling. It was unfamiliar, but not 
        unpleasing. Unsettling, but not unbearable. In fact, it was quite bearable. 
        Who would not like to be in a great wave of feeling? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        If you had been standing in the little thicket beside the footpath, you 
        would have seen Chris coming. He was breathing hard, and he crashed through 
        the bushes like a bull or some other reputedly clumsy beast. But there's 
        no beast so clumsy as a man in a rage.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He was walking in his bare feet. He had come from his apartment in the 
        center of town to Johan's house on the last lane within town limits. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He had been feeling this rage for hours. This rage, with its certainty, 
        had propelled him to this spot on the edge of town, to the last row of 
        houses before the hills began. To the house where Johan lived.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        How had this rage begun? What marked its point of inception? What were 
        its triggers?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        At least he knew enough to not answer those questions. The feeling was 
        its own proof of the rightness of what was going on. It was that rarest 
        of things, a thing desirable in itself without being a stepping stone 
        to something else. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Beneath his rage there was someone witnessing his rage and saying, "It's 
        about time you felt this rage. It's right that you should feel it, because 
        you're being robbed of the one and only thing that gives your life any 
        meaning. That one thing is the possession of Annabelle. She was almost 
        yours, and then this stranger, Johan, came to town and with his charming, 
        deceitful ways and took possession of what had been yours. He is the only 
        thing that stands in your way--because if he were gone, Annabelle would 
        no longer resist you. She is soft, she is an object, she wants to be possessed. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        And while he listened to this voice, there in the midst of his rage, Chris 
        knew there was something behind and beneath that voice, witnessing both 
        his rage and the voice commenting on it. This voice wasn't interested 
        in the rights or wrongs of what the voice was urging Chris to do. This 
        voice was only interested in commenting on the fact that a rage and a 
        voice were existing.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        But there was a voice behind that, commenting on how strange it was to 
        be in this situation--at the window to Johan's house, small hatchet in 
        his pocket, trembling on the brink of entering and doing something he 
        didn't want to put into words. He didn't want to look at the voice that 
        told him that this feeling and the voices commenting on it were of very 
        recent origin, they had begun minutes ago, maybe seconds. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        There might also have been a cautionary voice telling him he should be 
        careful about doing what a voice that had suddenly sprung up in his head 
        told him he should do, especially since that involved murder, and murder 
        was one of those things that can change your life forever, so you should 
        think about it at least for a moment or two before doing it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        But he didn't want to think about it! Too much time and agony, agony-tipped 
        time, had gone into the making of the decision to kill what blocked him 
        and then take when he wanted. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        And the voices were taking his attention away from what he was doing. 
        Right now he was opening the window into Johan's darkened parlor. He retained 
        enough attention to do this skillfully, silently, the way the dream had 
        told him it should be done. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He climbed in the window and out onto the moonlit rug in Johan's front 
        room. He smelled the faint unmistakable trace of John, and overlaying 
        it, the slight sweet fragrance of Annabelle. Quietly, quietly he entered 
        the room. Only his emotions were noisy, and they didn't make a sound to 
        any ears but his. </font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He stood, balanced on the balls of his feet, and ahead of him, in the 
        moonlight, he saw the dark shape of the staircase that led up to Johan's 
        sleeping room on the second floor. Without ever having been there, he 
        knew it was a square little room, with no windows. There was a bed with 
        a white bedspread pushed up against the wall, and there was a little night 
        stand beside it. Funny how you could know a thing like that before you 
        could ever know it. But this was a strange night, and a lot of things 
        were different tonight. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He went up the stairs, entered the room, and experienced a moment of shock 
        when he found Johan not lying in the bed, as he had imagined, but sitting 
        in a straight-backed chair beside it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Something about Johan was different. It took Charles a moment to figure 
        out what it was. Then he had it. Instead of being a young fellow in his 
        middle thirties, as he had been only the previous day, Johan was now an 
        enormous beetle with dark bronze armor. Sitting in a chair wasn't natural 
        for a beetle, but Johan had managed it somehow. Johan had the triangular 
        face of a beetle, and you might have thought that one beetle looks very 
        much like another beetle, but that's to a human's eyes, whereas to a person 
        like Charles---who was just starting to suspect he was not the person 
        he had assumed himself to be, but something other, better, more interesting--to 
        his eyes, Johan was fully characterized in his features, and showed up 
        as a nice guy with a keen, intelligent face and two expressive eyes on 
        the end of eye-stalks. And an expressive smile to his mouth slit. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You've 
        got it, don't you?" Johan asked. "The insect perception, I mean."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
        suppose I do," Charles said. Somehow he had never imagined that Johan 
        would address him in this way--from a position inside the nightmare, you 
        could say.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Johan shifted his thorax slightly. He folded one spindly leg over another. 
        He said, "It's not so strange, you know. Mankind has always humanized 
        insects, reptiles, birds, animals. Made them over in his own image. Might 
        that not be because they are a part of him, part of his original makeup?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Seems 
        possible," Charles said, his hand gripping the handle of the hatchet under 
        his shirt, his eyes considering the distance between him and Johan. A 
        distance he was slowly creeping into, slowly diminishing. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Finally, Charles said, "It's like a hallucination, isn't it?"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Very 
        much so," Johan said. "But hallucinations are unreal, and this is real. 
        You're angry because I've stolen Annabelle, who used to be your girlfriend."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
        do you suppose we should do about that?" Johan said, continuing to edge 
        forward, so that the hatchet stroke would be sure. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Why 
        don't we face facts. We both want her."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And 
        only one can have her."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Wrong!" 
        Johan cried. "That's the proposition I beg you to look at now. We both 
        want her, for different reasons, and at different times."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Where 
        is she?" Charles asked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Right 
        here, in the guest bedroom."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Johan uncrossed his legs. "Follow me." He walked toward the door on his 
        many legs. Charles knew that that was the moment to strike, with Johan's 
        head turned away. But he put if off--this was too interesting. Anyhow, 
        he wanted to see Annabelle. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He followed Johan down the hall and into the next room. There was an overhead 
        light on. By its glow, Charles could see Annabelle lying on the bed. She 
        was all bloody. She didn't move.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Damn 
        you!" Charles said, and pulled out the hatchet.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No, 
        wait!" Johan said. And Charles wondered for a moment how many times this 
        moment had been played out, and with what differing outcomes. He lifted 
        the hatchet.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This 
        is a delicate moment," Johan said. "But I beg you to consider what you 
        really want of Annabelle. I have merely prepared her for you."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Annabelle was quite dead, and there seemed to be a scum over the blood, 
        which had already begun to dry. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You 
        killed her!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Well, 
        yes, It's what I wanted to do. What I was born to do. I'm not an aggressive 
        carnivorous beetle for nothing. But consider yourself, for a moment. Look 
        at yourself in the tall pier-glass there beside the bed."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        There is a moment before a nightmare becomes real when you can still refuse 
        it; or think you can. And Charles was at that point now. There were many 
        ways he could go. But he happened to look at himself in the mirror.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        He saw a long gray, pulpy thing with a horny, segmented skin, a little 
        round head, a full set of teeth, and many many tiny feet. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Well 
        I'll be damned," he said. "I'm a larva."</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"A 
        very special larva," Johan said. "You're ready to sleep now with the beloved. 
        I have done my share. My moment with her is over. Now it is your turn. 
        You should be glad I killed her for you."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Charles knew it was only politeness to agree. But he was caught up in 
        another wave of feeling. This one was directed to eating, to entering 
        the beloved. He found it natural to begin at her white abdomen, and to 
        continue munching until he was inside. </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The 
        townspeople will be very surprised," Johan said. "If there are townspeople, 
        that is."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="black" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        At the moment Charles didn't care if there were townspeople or not. He 
        only knew that fate had conspired to bring him to the racial dream of 
        an insect, and here, in this red and black place, he could feel something 
        moving in his insides. The final wonder would soon begin. He would give 
        birth.</font></p>
