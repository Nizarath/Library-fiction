style='font-size:18.0pt'>By ROBERT SHECKLEY</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><b><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>WARRIOR RACE</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i>Destroying the spirit </i>of <i>the
enemy is the goal of war and the aliens had the best </i>way! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>THEY never did discover whose
fault it was. Fannia pointed out that if Donnaught had had the brains of an ox,
as well as the build, he would have remembered to check the tanks. Donnaught,
although twice as big as him, wasn't quite as fast with an insult. He
intimated, after a little thought, that Fannia's nose might have obstructed his
reading of the fuel guage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>This still left them twenty
light-years from Thetis, with a cupful of transformer fuel in the emergency
tank. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;All right,&quot; Fannia said
presitly. &quot;What's done is done. We can squeeze about three light years out
of the fuel before we're back on atomics. Hand me <i>The Galactic Pilot</i>—unless
you forgot that, too.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Donnaught dragged the bulky
microfilm volume out of its locker, and they explored its pages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i>The Galactic Pilot </i>told
them they were in a sparse, seldom-visited section of space, which they already
knew. The nearest planetary system was Hatterfield; no intelligent life there.
Sersus had a native population, but no refueling facilities. The same with
Illed, Hung and Porderai. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ah-ha!&quot; Fannia said.
&quot;Read that, Donnaught. If you can read, that is.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Cascella,&quot; Donnaught
read, slowly and clearly, following the line with a thick forefinger.
&quot;Type M sun. Three planets, intelligent (AA3C) human-type life on second.
Oxygen-breathers. Non-mechanical. Religious. Friendly. Unique social structure,
described in Galactic Survey Report 33877242. Population estimate: stable at
three billion. Basic Cascellan vocabulary taped under Cas33b2. Scheduled for
resurvey 2375A.D. Cache of transformer fuel left, beam coordinate 8741 kgl.
Physical descript : Unocc. flatland.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Transformer fuel, boy!&quot;
Fannia said gleefully. &quot;I believe we will get to Thetis, after all.&quot;
He punched the new direction on the ship's tape. &quot;If that fuel's still
there.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Should we read up on the
unique social structure?&quot; Donnaught asked, still poring over <i>The
Galactic Pilot. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Certainly,&quot; Fannia
said. &quot;Just step over to the main galactic base on Earth and buy me a
copy.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I forgot,&quot; Donnaught
admitted slowly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Let me see,&quot; Fannia
said, dragging out the ship's language library. &quot;Cascellan, Cascellan ...
Here it is. Be good while I learn the language.&quot; He set the tape in the
hypnophone and switched it on. &quot;Another useless tongue in my overstuffed
head,&quot; he murmured, and then the hypnophone took over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>COMING out of transformer with at
least a drop of fuel left, they switched to atomics. Fannia rode the beam right
across the planet, locating the slender metal spire of the Galactic Survey
cache. The plain was no longer unoccupied, however, The Cascellans had built a
city around the cache, and the spire dominated the crude wood-and-mud
buildings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hang on,&quot; Fannia said,
and brought the ship down on the outskirts of the city, in a field of stubble. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.25in'><img
width=276 height=511
src="Sheckley,%20Robert%20-%20Warrior%20Race%20v1.0_files/image001.jpg"
alt=Picture></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now look,&quot; Fannia said,
unfastening his safety belt. &quot;We're just here for fuel. No souvenirs, no
side-trips, no fraternizing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Through the port, they could see a
cloud of dust from the city. As it came closer, they made out figures running
toward their ship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What do you think this
unique social structure is?&quot; Donnaught asked, pensively checking the
charge in a needler gun. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I know not and care
less,&quot; Fannia said, struggling into space armor. &quot;Get dressed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The air's breathable.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Look, pachyderm, for all we
know, these Cascellans think the proper way to greet visitors is to chop off
their heads and stuff them with green apples. If Galactic says unique, it
probably means unique.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Galactic said they were
friendly.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That means they haven't got
atomic bombs. Come on, get dressed.&quot; Donnaught put down the needler and
struggled into an oversize suit of space armor. Both men strapped on needlers,
paralyzers, and a few grenades. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't think we have
anything to worry about,&quot; Fannia said, tightening the last nut on his
helmet. &quot;Even if they get rough, they can't crack space armor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>And if they're not rough, we won't
have any trouble. Maybe these gewgaws will help.&quot; He picked up a box of
trading articles —mirrors, toys and the like. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Helmeted and armored, Fannia slid
out the port and raised one hand to the Cascellans. The language, hypnotically
placed in his mind, leaped to his lips. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We come as friends and
brothers. Take us to the chief.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The natives clustered around,
gaping at the ship and the space armor. Although they had the same number of
eyes, ears and limbs as humans, they completely missed looking like them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If they're friendly,&quot;
Donnaught asked, climbing out of the port, &quot;why all the hardware?&quot;
The Cascellans were dressed predominantly in a collection of knives, swords and
daggers. Each man had at least five, and some had eight or nine: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Maybe Galactic got their
signals crossed,&quot; Fannia said, as the natives spread out in an escort.
&quot;Or maybe the natives just use the knives for mumblypeg.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>THE city was typical of a non-mechanical
culture. Narrow, packed-dirt streets twisted between ramshackle huts. A few
two-story buildings threatened to collapse at any minute. A stench filled the
air, so strong that Fannia's filter couldn't quite eradicate it. The Cascellans
bounded ahead of the heavily laden Earthmen, dashing around like a pack of
playful puppies. Their knives glittered and clanked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The chief's house was the only
three-story building in the city. The tall spire of the cache was right behind
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If you come in peace,&quot;
the chief said when they entered, &quot;you are welcome.&quot; He was a
middle-aged Cascellan with at least fifteen knives strapped to various parts of
his person. He squatted cross-legged on a raised dais. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We are privileged,&quot;
Fannia said. He remembered from the hypnotic language lesson that
&quot;chief&quot; on Cascella meant more than it usually did on Earth. The
chief here was a combination of king, high priest, deity and bravest warrior. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We have a few simple gifts
here,&quot; Fannia added, placing the gewgaws at the king's feet. &quot;Will
his majesty accept?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No,&quot; the king said.
&quot;We accept no gifts.&quot; Was that the unique social structure? Fannia
wondered. It certainly was not human. &quot;We are a warrior race. What we
want, we take.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Fannia sat cross-legged in front
of the dais and exchanged conversation with the king while Donnaught played
with the spurned toys. Trying to overcome the initial bad impression, Fannia
told the chief about the stars and other worlds, since simple people usually
liked fables. He spoke c the ship, not mentioning yet that it was out of fuel.
He spoke Cascella, telling the chief how its fame was known throughout the
Galaxy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That is as it should
be,&quot; the chief said proudly. &quot;We are a race of warriors, the like of
which has never been seen. Every man of us dies fighting.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You must have fought some
great wars,&quot; Fannia said politely, wondering what idiot had written up the
galactic report. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I have not fought a war for
many years,&quot; the chief said. &quot;We are united now, and all our enemies
have joined us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Bit by bit, Fannia led up to the
matter of the fuel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What is this 'fuel?'&quot;
the chief asked, haltingly because there was no equivalent for it in the
Cascellan language. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It makes our ship go.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And where is it?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;In the metal spire,&quot;
Fannia said. &quot;If you would just allow us—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;In the holy shrine?&quot;
the chief exclaimed, shocked. &quot;The tall metal church which the gods left
here long ago?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Fannia said
sadly, knowing what was coming. &quot;I guess that's it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It is sacrilege for an
outworlder to go near it,&quot; the chief said. &quot;I forbid it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We need the fuel.&quot;
Fanna was getting tired of sitting cross-legged. Space armor wasn't built for
complicated postures. &quot;The spire was put here for such emergencies.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Strangers, know that I am
god of my people, as well as their leader. If you dare approach the sacred
temple, there will be war.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I was afraid of that,&quot;
Fannia said, getting to his feet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And since we are a race of
warriors,&quot; the chief said, &quot;at my command, every fighting man of the
planet will move against you. More will come from the hills and from across the
rivers.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Abruptly, the chief drew a knife.
It must have been a signal, because every native in the room did the same_ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>FANNIA dragged Donnaught away from
the toys. &quot;Look, lummox. These friendly warriors can't do a damn thing to
us. Those knives can't cut space armor, and I doubt if they have anything
better. Don't let them pile up on you, though. Use the paralyzer first, the
needler if they really get thick.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Right.&quot; Donnaught
whisked out and primed a paralyzer in a single coordinated movement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>With weapons, Donnaught was fast
and reliable, which was virtue enough for Fannia to keep him as a partner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We'll cut around this
building and grab the fuel. Two cans ought to be enough. Then we'll beat it
fast.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They walked out the building,
follow by the Cascellans. Four carriers lifted the chief, who was barking
orders. The narrow street outside was suddenly jammed with armed natives. No
one tried to touch them yet, but at least a thousand knives were flashing in
the sun. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>In front of the cache was solid
phalanx of Cascellans. The stood behind a network of ropes that probably marked
the boundary between sacred and profane ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Get set for it,&quot; Fannia
said, and stepped over the ropes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Immediately the foremost temple
guard raised his knife. Fannia brought up the paralyzer, not firing it yet,
still moving forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The foremost native shouted
something, and the knife swept across in a glittering arc. The Cascellan
gurgled something else, staggered and fell. Bright blood oozed from his throat.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I <i>told </i>you not to use
the needler yet!&quot; Fannia said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I didn't,&quot; Donnaught
protested. Glancing back, Fannia saw that Donnaught's needler was till
holstered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Then I don't get it,&quot;
said Fannia bewilderedly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Three more natives bounded
forward, their knives held high. They tumbled to the ground also. Fannia
stopped and watched as a platoon of natives advanced on them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Once they were within stabbing
range of the Earthmen, the natives were slitting their own throats! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Fannia was frozen for a moment,
unable to believe his eyes. Donnaught halted behind him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Natives were rushing forward by
the hundreds now, their knives poised, screaming at the Earthmen. As they came
within range, each native stabbed himself, tumbling on a quickly growing pile
of bodies. In minutes the Earthmen were surrounded by a heap of bleeding
Cascellan flesh, which was steadily growing higher. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;All right!&quot; Fannia
shouted. &quot;Stop it.&quot; He yanked Donnaught back with him, to profane
ground. &quot;Truce!&quot; he yelled in Cascellan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The crowd parted and the chief was
carried through. With two knives clenched in his fists, he was panting from
excitement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We have won the first
battle!&quot; he said proudly. &quot;The might of our warriors frightens even
such aliens as yourselves. You shall not profane our temple while a man is
alive on Cascella!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The natives shouted their approval
and triumph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The two aliens dazedly stumbled
back to their ship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>SO that's what Galactic meant by
'a unique social structure,' &quot; Fannie said morosely. He stripped off his
armor and lay down on his bunk. &quot;Their way of making war is to suicide
their enemies into capitulation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They must be nuts,&quot;
Don-naught grumbled. &quot;That's no way to fight.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It works, doesn't it?&quot;
Fannia got up and stared out a porthole. The sun was setting, painting the city
a charming red in its glow. The beams of light glistened off the spire of the
Galactic cache. Through the open doorway they could hear the boom and rattle of
drums. &quot;Tribal call to arms,&quot; Fannia said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I still say it's
crazy.&quot; Donnaught had some definite ideas on fighting. &quot;It ain't
human.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'll buy that. The idea
seems to be that if enough people slaughter themselves, the enemy gives up out
of sheer guilty conscience? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What if the enemy doesn't
give up?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Before these people united,
they must have fought it out tribe to tribe, suiciding until someone gave up.
The losers probably, joined the victors; the tribe must have grown until it
could take over the planet by sheer weight of numbers.&quot; Fannia looked
carefully at Donnaught, trying to see if he understood. &quot;It's anti-survival,
of course; if someone didn't give up, the race would probably kill
themselves.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;But war of any kind is
anti-survival. Perhaps they've got rules.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Couldn't we just barge in
and grab the fuel quick?&quot; Donnaught asked. &quot;And get out before they
all killed themselves?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't think so,&quot;
Fannia said. &quot;They might go on committing suicide for the next ten years,
figuring they were still fighting us.&quot; He looked thoughtfully at the city.
&quot;It's that chief of their. He's their god and he'd probably keep them
suiciding until he was the only man left. Then he'd grin, say, 'We are great
warriors,' and kill himself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Donnaught shrugged his big
shoulders in disgust. &quot;Why don't we knock him off?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They'd just elect another
god.&quot; The sun was almost below the horizon now. &quot;I've got an idea,
though,&quot; Fannia said. He scratched his head. &quot;It might work. All we
can do is try.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>AT midnight, the two men sneaked
out of the ship, moving silently into the city. They were both dressed in space
armor again. Donnaught carried two empty fuel cans. Fannia had his paralyzer
out. . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The streets were dark and silent
as they sped along walls and around posts, keeping out o sight. A native turned
a corner suddenly, but Fannia paralyzed him before he could make a sound. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They crouched in the darkness,, in
the mouth of an alley facing the cache. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Have you got it
straight?&quot; Fannia asked. &quot;I paralyze the guards. You bolt in and fill
up, those cans. We get the hell out of here, quick. When they check, they find
the cans still there. Maybe they won't commit suicide then.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The men moved across the shadowy
steps in front of the cache. There were three Cascellans guarding the entrance,
their knives stuck in their loincloths. Fannia stunned them with a medium
charge, and Donnaught broke into a run. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Torches instantly flared, natives
boiled out of every alleyway, shouting, waving their knives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We've been ambushed!&quot;
Fannia shouted. &quot;Get back here, Donnaught!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Donnaught hurriedly retreated. The
natives had been waiting for them. Screaming, yowling, they rushed at the
Earthmen, slitting their own throats at five-foot range. Bodies tumbled in
front of Fannia, almost tripping him as he backed up. Donnaught caught him by
an arm and yanked him straight. They ran out of the sacred area. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Truce, damn it!&quot; Fannia
called out. &quot;Let me speak to the chief. Stop it! Stop it! I want a
truce!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Reluctantly, the Cascellans
stopped their slaughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;This is war,&quot; the chief
said, striding forward. His almost human face was stern under the torchlight.
&quot;You have seen our warriors. You know now that you cannot stand against
them. The word has spread to all our lands. My entire people are prepared to do
battle.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He looked proudly at his fellow Cascellans,
then back to the Earthmen. &quot;I myself will lead my people into battle now.
There will be no stopping us. We will fight until you surrender yourselves
completely, stripping off your armor.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Wait, chief,&quot; Fannia
panted, sick at the sight of so much blood. The clearing was a scene out of the
Inferno. Hundreds of bodies were sprawled around. The streets were muddy with
blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Let me confer with my
partner tonight. I will speak with you tomorrow.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No.&quot; the chief said.
&quot;You started the battle. It must go to its conclusion. Brave men wish to
die in battle. It is our fondest wish. You are the first enemy we have had in
many years, since we subdued the mountain tribes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sure,&quot; Fannia said.
&quot;But let's talk about it—&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I myself will fight
you,&quot; the chief said, holding up a dagger. &quot;I will die for my people;
as a warrior must!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hold it!&quot; Fannia
shouted. &quot;Grant us a truce. We are allowed to fight only by sunlight. It
is a tribal taboo.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The chief thought for a moment, then
said, &quot;Very well. Until tomorrow.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The beaten Earthmen walked slowly
back to their ship amid the jeers of the victorious populace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>NEXT morning, Fannia still didn't
have a plan. He knew that he had to have fuel; he wasn't planning on spending
the rest of his life on Cascella, or waiting until the Galactic Survey sent
another ship, in fifty years or so. On the other hand, he hesitated at the idea
of being responsible for the death of anywhere up to three billion people. It
wouldn't be a very good record to take to Thetis. The Galactic Survey might
find out about it. Anyway, he just wouldn't do it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He was stuck both ways. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Slowly, the two men walked out to
meet the chief. Fannia was still searching wildly for an idea while listening
to the drums booming. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If there was only someone we
could fight,&quot; Donnaught mourned, looking at his useless blasters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's the deal,&quot;
Fannia said. &quot;Guilty conscience is making sinners of us all, or something
like that. They expect us to give in before the carnage gets out of hand.&quot;
He considered for a moment. &quot;It's not so crazy, actually. On Earth, armies
don't usually fight until every last man is slaughtered on one side. Someone
surrenders when they've had enough.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If they'd just fight
us!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yeah, if they only—&quot; He
stopped. &quot;We'll fight each other!&quot; he said. &quot;These people look
at suicide as war. Wouldn't they look upon war—real fighting—as suicide?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What good would that do
us?&quot; Donnaught asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They were coming into the city now
and the streets were lined with armed natives. Around the city there were
thousands more. Natives were filling the plain, as far as the eye could see.
Evidently they had responded to the drums and were here to do battle with the
aliens. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Which meant, of course, a
wholesale suicide. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Look at it this way,&quot;
Fanni said. &quot;If a guy plans on suicide on Earth, what do we do?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Arrest him?&quot; Donnaught
asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not at first. We offer him
anything he wants, if he just won't do it. People offer the guy money, a job,
their daughters, anything, just so he won't do it. It's taboo on Earth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;So?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;So,&quot; Fannia went on,
&quot;maybe fighting is just as taboo here. Maybe they'll offer us fuel, if
we'll just stop.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Donnaught looked dubious, but
Fannia felt it was worth a try. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>THEY pushed their way through the crowded
city, to the entrance of the cache. The chief was waiting for them, beaming on
his people like a jovial war god. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Are you ready to do
battle?&quot; he asked. &quot;Or to surrender?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sure,&quot; Fannia said.
&quot;Now, Donnaught!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He swung, and his mailed fist
caught Donnaught in the ribs. Donnaught blinked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Come on, you idiot, hit me back.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Donnaught swung, and Fannia
staggered from the force of the blow. In a second they were at it like a pair
of blacksmiths, mailed blows ringing from their armored hides. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A little lighter,&quot;
Fannia gasped, picking himself up from the ground. &quot;You're denting my
ribs.&quot; He belted Donnaught viciously on the helmet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Stop it!&quot; the chief
cried. &quot;This is disgusting!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's working,&quot; Fannia
panted. &quot;Now let me strangle you. I think that might do it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Donnaught obliged by falling to
the ground. Fannia clamped both hands around Donnaught's armored neck, and
squeezed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Make believe you're in
agony, idiot,&quot; he said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Donnaught groaned and moaned as
convincingly as he could. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You must stop!&quot; the
chief screamed. &quot;It is terrible to kill another!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Then let me get some
fuel,&quot; Fannia said, tightening his grip on Donnaught's throat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The chief thought it over for a
little while. Then he shook his head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You are aliens. If you want
to do this disgraceful thing, do it. But you shall not profane our religious
relics.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>DONNAUGHT and Fannia staggered to
their feet. Fannia was exhausted from fighting in the heavy space armor; he
barely made it up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now,&quot; the chief said,
&quot;surrender at once. Take off your armor or do battle with us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The thousands of warriors—possibly
millions, because more were arriving every second —shouted their blood-wrath.
The cry was taken up on the outskirts and echoed to the hills, where more
fighting men were pouring down into the crowded plain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Fannia's face contorted. He
couldn't give himself and Donnaught up to the Cascellans. They might be cooked
at the next church supper. For a moment he considered going after the fuel and
letting the damned fools suicide all they pleased. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>His mind an angry blank, Fannia
staggered forward and hit the chief in the face with a mailed glove. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The chief went down, and the
natives backed away in horror. Quickly, the chief snapped out a knife and
brought it up to his throat. Fannia's hands closed on the chief's wrists. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Listen to me,&quot; Fannia
croaked. &quot;We're going to take that fuel. If any man makes a move—if anyone
kills himself—I'll kill your chief.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The natives milled around
uncertainly. The chief was struggling wildly in Fannia's hands, trying to get a
knife to his throat, so he could die honorably. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Get it,&quot; Fapnia told
Don-naught, &quot;and hurry it up.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The natives were uncertain just
what to do. They had their knives poised at their throats, ready to plunge if
battle was joined. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Don't do it,&quot; Fannia
warned. &quot;I'll kill the chief and then he'll never die a warrior's
death.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The chief was still trying to kill
himself. Desperately, Fannia held on, knowing he had to keep him from suicide
in order to hold the threat of death over him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Listen, Chief,&quot; Fannia
said, eying the uncertain crowd. &quot;I must have your promise there'll be no
more war between us. Either I get it or I kill you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Warriors!&quot; the chief
roared. &quot;Choose a new ruler. Forget me and do battle!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The Cascellans were still
uncertain, but knives started to lift. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If you do it,&quot; Fannia
shouted in despair, &quot;I'll kill your chief. <i>I'll kill all of you!&quot; </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>That stopped them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I have powerful magic in my
ship. I can kill every last man, and then you won't be able to die a warrior's
death. <i>Or </i>get to heaven!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The chief tried to free himself
with a mighty surge that almost tore one of his arms free, but Fannia held on,
pinning both arms behind his back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Very well,&quot; the chief
said, tears springing into his eyes. &quot;A warrior must die by his own hand.
You have won, alien.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The crowd shouted curses as the
Earthmen carried the chief and the cans of fuel back to the ship. They waved
their knives and danced up d down in a frenzy of hate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Let's make it fast,&quot;
Fannia said, after Donnaught had fueled the ship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He gave the chief a push and
leaped in. In a second they were in the air, heading for Thetis and the nearest
bar at top speed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The natives were hot for blood—their
own. Every man of them pledged his life to wiping out the insult to their
leader and god, and to their shrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>But the aliens were gone. There
was nobody to fight. </p>
