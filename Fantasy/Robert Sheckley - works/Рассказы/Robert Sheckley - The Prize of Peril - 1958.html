    <h1 align="center">The Prize of Peril</h1>
        <h3 align="center">by Robert Sheckley</h3>
    <br>
&nbsp;
    <p>Raeder lifted his head cautiously above the windowsill. 
    He saw the fire-escape, and below it a narrow alley. There was a 
    weather-beaten baby carriage in the alley and three garbage cans. As he 
    watched, a black-sleeved arm moved from behind the furthest can, with 
    something shiny in its fist. Raeder ducked down. A bullet smashed through 
    the window above his head and punctured the ceiling, showering him with 
    plaster.</p>
    <p>Now he knew about the alley. It was guarded, just like the door. </p>
    <p>He lay at full length on the cracked linoleum, staring at the bullet hole 
    in the ceiling, listening to the sounds outside the door. He was a tall man 
    with bloodshot eyes and a two-day stubble. Grime and fatigue had etched 
    lines into his face. Fear had touched his features, tightening a muscle here 
    and twitching a nerve there. The results were startling. His face had 
    character now, for it was reshaped by the expectation of death. </p>
    <p>There was a gunman in the alley and two on the stairs. He was trapped. He 
    was dead. </p>
    <p>Sure, Raeder thought, he still moved and breathed, but that was only 
    because of death's inefficiency. Death would take care of him in a few 
    minutes. Death would poke holes in his face and body, artistically dab his 
    clothes with blood, arrange his limbs in some grotesque position of the 
    graveyard ballet … </p>
    <p>Raeder bit his lip sharply. He wanted to live. There had to be a way. </p>
    <p>He rolled onto his stomach and surveyed the dingy cold-water apartment 
    into which the killers had driven him. It was a perfect little one-room 
    coffin. It had a door, which was watched, and a fire escape, which was 
    watched. And it had a tiny windowless bathroom. </p>
    <p>He crawled to the bathroom and stood up. There was a ragged hole in the 
    ceiling, almost four inches wide. If he could enlarge it, crawl through into 
    the apartment above … </p>
    <p>He heard a muffled thud. The killers were impatient. They were beginning 
    to break down the door. </p>
    <p>He studied the hole in the ceiling. No use even considering it. He could 
    never enlarge it in time. </p>
    <p>They were smashing against the door, grunting each time they struck. Soon 
    the lock would tear out, or the hinges would pull out of the rotting wood. 
    The door would go down, and the two blank-faced men would enter, dusting off 
    their jackets … </p>
    <p>But surely someone would help him! He took the tiny television set from 
    his pocket. The picture was blurred, and he didn't bother to adjust it. The 
    audio was clear and precise. </p>
    <p>He listened to the well-modulated voice of Mike Terry addressing his vast 
    audience. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>… terrible spot,</i>&quot; Terry was saying. &quot;<i>Yes, folks, Jim Raeder is 
    in a truly terrible predicament. He had been hiding, you'll remember, in a 
    third-rate Broadway hotel under an assumed name. It seemed safe enough. But 
    the bellhop recognized him, and gave that information to the Thompson gang.</i>&quot;
    </p>
    <p>The door creaked under repeated blows. Raeder clutched the little 
    television set and listened. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>Jim Raeder just managed to escape from the hotel! Closely pursued, he 
    entered a brownstone at one fifty-six West End Avenue. His intention was to 
    go over the roofs. And it might have worked, folks, it just might have 
    worked. But the roof door was locked. It looked like the end … But Raeder 
    found that apartment seven was unoccupied and unlocked. He entered …</i>&quot;
    </p>
    <p>Terry paused for emphasis, then cried—&quot;<i>and now he's trapped there, 
    trapped like a rat in a cage! The Thompson gang is breaking down the door! 
    The fire escape is guarded! Our camera crew, situated in a nearby building, 
    is giving you a close-up now. Look, folks, just look! Is there no hope for 
    Jim Raeder?</i>&quot; </p>
    <p><i>Is there no hope?</i> Raeder silently echoed, perspiration pouring 
    from him as he stood in the dark, stifling little bathroom, listening to the 
    steady thud against the door. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>Wait a minute!</i>&quot; Mike Terry cried. &quot;<i>Hang on, Jim Raeder, hang 
    on a little longer. Perhaps there is hope! I have an urgent call from one of 
    our viewers, a call on the Good Samaritan Line! Here's someone who thinks he 
    can help you, Jim. Are you listening, Jim Raeder?</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder waited, and heard the hinges tearing out of rotten wood. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>Go right ahead, sir,</i>&quot; said Mike Terry. &quot;<i>What is your name, 
    sir?</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>Er—Felix Bartholemow.</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>Don't be nervous, Mr. Bartholemow. Go right ahead.</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>Well, okay. Mr. Raeder,</i>&quot; said an old man's shaking voice, &quot;<i>I 
    used to live at one five six West End Avenue. Same apartment you're trapped 
    in, Mr. Raeder—fact! Look, that bathroom has got a window, Mr. Raeder. It's 
    been painted over, but it has got a—</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder pushed the television set into his pocket. He located the outlines 
    of the window and kicked. Glass shattered, and daylight poured startling in. 
    He cleared the jagged sill and quickly peered down. </p>
    <p>Below was a long drop to a concrete courtyard. </p>
    <p>The hinges tore free. He heard the door opening. Quickly Raeder climbed 
    through the window, hung by his fingertips for a moment, and dropped. </p>
    <p>The shock was stunning. Groggily he stood up. A face appeared at the 
    bathroom window. </p>
    <p>&quot;Tough luck,&quot; said the man, leaning out and taking careful aim with a 
    snub-nosed .38. </p>
    <p>At that moment a smoke bomb exploded inside the bathroom. </p>
    <p>The killer's shot went wide. He turned, cursing. More smoke bombs burst 
    in the courtyard, obscuring Raeder's figure. </p>
    <p>He could hear Mike Terry's frenzied voice over the TV set in his pocket. 
    &quot;<i>Now run for it!</i>&quot; Terry was screaming. &quot;<i>Run, Jim Raeder, run for 
    your life. Run now, while the killers' eyes are filled with smoke. And thank 
    Good Samaritan Sarah Winters, of three four one two Edgar Street, Brockton, 
    Mass., for donating five smoke bombs and employing the services of a man to 
    throw them!</i>&quot; In a quieter voice, Terry continued. &quot;<i>You've saved a 
    man's life today, Mrs. Winters. Would you tell our audience how it—</i>&quot; 
    Raeder wasn't able to hear any more. He was running through the smoke-filled 
    courtyard, past clotheslines, into the open street. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <center>
    <p>·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp; </p>
    </center>
    <p><br>
    <br>
    He walked down 63<sup>rd</sup> Street, slouching to minimize his height, 
    staggering slightly from exertion, dizzy from lack of food and sleep. </p>
    <p>&quot;Hey, you!&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder turned. A middle-aged woman was sitting on the steps of a 
    brownstone, frowning at him. </p>
    <p>&quot;You're Raeder, aren't you? The one they're trying to kill?&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder started to walk away. </p>
    <p>&quot;Come inside here, Raeder,&quot; the woman said. </p>
    <p>Perhaps it was a trap. But Raeder knew that he had to depend upon the 
    generosity and good-heartedness of the people. He was their representative, 
    a projection of themselves, an average guy in trouble. Without them, he was 
    lost. With them, nothing could harm him. </p>
    <p>Trust in the people, Mike Terry had told him. They'll never let you down.
    </p>
    <p>He followed the woman into her parlor. She told him to sit down and left 
    the room, returning almost immediately with a plate of stew. She stood 
    watching him while he ate, as one would watch an ape in the zoo eat peanuts.
    </p>
    <p>Two children came out of the kitchen and stared at him. Three overalled 
    men came out of the bedroom and focused a television camera on him. There 
    was a big television set in the parlor. As he gulped his food, Raeder 
    watched the image of Mike Terry and listened to the man's strong, sincere, 
    worried voice. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>There he is, folks,</i>&quot; Terry was saying. &quot;<i>There's Jim Raeder 
    now, eating his first square meal in two days. Our camera crews have really 
    been working to cover this for you! Thanks, boys … Folks, Jim Raeder has 
    been given a brief sanctuary by Mrs. Velma O'Dell, of three forty-three 
    Sixty-Third Street. Thank you, Good Samaritan O'Dell! It's really wonderful 
    how people from all walks of life have taken Jim Raeder to their hearts!</i>&quot;
    </p>
    <p>&quot;You better hurry,&quot; Mrs. O'Dell said. </p>
    <p>&quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; Raeder said. </p>
    <p>&quot;I don't want no gunplay in my apartment.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I'm almost finished, ma'am.&quot; </p>
    <p>One of the children asked. &quot;Aren't they going to kill him?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Shut up,&quot; said Mrs. O'Dell. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>Yes, Jim,</i>&quot; chanted Mike Terry. &quot;<i>You'd better hurry. Your 
    killers aren't far behind. They aren't stupid men, Jim. Vicious, warped, 
    insane—yes! But not stupid. They're following a trail of blood—blood from 
    your torn hand, Jim!</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder hadn't realized until now that he'd cut his hand on the 
    windowsill. </p>
    <p>&quot;Here, I'll bandage that,&quot; Mrs. O'Dell said. Raeder stood up and let her 
    bandage his hand. Then she gave him a brown jacket and a gray slouch hat.
    </p>
    <p>&quot;My husband's stuff,&quot; she said. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>He has a disguise, folks!</i>&quot; Mike Terry cried delightedly. &quot;<i>This 
    is something new! A disguise! With seven hours to go until he's safe!</i>&quot;
    </p>
    <p>&quot;Now get out of here,&quot; Mrs. O'Dell said. </p>
    <p>&quot;I'm going, ma'am,&quot; Raeder said. &quot;Thanks.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I think you're stupid,&quot; she said. &quot;I think you're stupid to be involved 
    in this.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;It just isn't worth it.&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder thanked her and left. He walked to Broadway, caught a subway to 59<sup>th</sup> 
    Street, then an uptown local to 86<sup>th</sup>. There he bought a newspaper 
    and changed for the Manhasset through-express. </p>
    <p>He glanced at his watch. He had six and a half hours to go. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <center>
    <p>·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp; </p>
    </center>
    <p><br>
    <br>
    The subway roared under Manhattan. Raeder dozed, his bandaged hand concealed 
    under the newspaper, the hat pulled over his face. Had he been recognized 
    yet? Had he shaken the Thompson gang? Or was someone telephoning them now?
    </p>
    <p>Dreamily he wondered if he had escaped death, or was he still a cleverly 
    animated corpse, moving around because of death's inefficiency? (My dear, 
    death is so <i>laggard</i> these days! Jim Raeder walked about for hours 
    after he died and actually answered people's <i>questions</i> before he 
    could be decently buried!) </p>
    <p>Raeder's eyes snapped open. He had dreamed something … unpleasant. He 
    couldn't remember what. </p>
    <p>He closed his eyes again and remembered, with mild astonishment, a time 
    when he had been in no trouble. </p>
    <p>That was two years ago. He had been a big, pleasant young man working as 
    a truck driver's helper. He had no talents. He was too modest to have 
    dreams. </p>
    <p>The tight-faced little truck driver had the dreams for him. &quot;Why not try 
    for a television show, Jim? I would if I had your looks. They like nice, 
    average guys with nothing much on the ball. As contestants. Everybody likes 
    guys like that. Why not look into it?&quot; </p>
    <p>So he had looked into it. The owner of the local television store had 
    explained it further. </p>
    <p>&quot;You see, Jim, the public is sick of highly trained athletes with their 
    trick reflexes and their professional courage. Who can feel for guys like 
    that? Who can identify? People want to watch exciting things, sure, but not 
    when some joker is making it his business for fifty thousand a year. That's 
    why organized sports are in a slump. That's why the thrill shows are 
    booming.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; said Raeder. </p>
    <p>&quot;Six years ago, Jim, Congress passed the Voluntary Suicide Act. Those old 
    senators talked a lot about free will and self-determinism at the time. But 
    that's all crap. You know what the Act really means? It means the amateurs 
    can risk their lives for the big loot, not just professionals. In the old 
    days you had to be a professional boxer or footballer or hockey player if 
    you wanted your brains beaten out legally for money. But now that 
    opportunity is open to ordinary people like you, Jim.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; Raeder said again. </p>
    <p>&quot;It's a marvelous opportunity. Take you. You're no better than anyone, 
    Jim. Anything you can do, anyone can do. You're <i>average.</i> I think the 
    thrill shows would go for you.&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder permitted himself to dream. Television shows looked like a sure 
    road to riches for a pleasant young fellow with no particular talent or 
    training. He wrote a letter to a show called <i>Hazard</i> and enclosed a 
    photograph of himself. </p>
    <p><i>Hazard</i> was interested in him. The JBC network investigated, and 
    found that he was average enough to satisfy the wariest viewer. His 
    parentage and affiliations were checked. At last he was summoned to New York 
    and interviewed by Mr. Moulain. </p>
    <p>Moulain was dark and intense, and chewed gum as he talked. &quot;You'll do,&quot; 
    he snapped. &quot;But not for <i>Hazard.</i> You'll appear on <i>Spills.</i> It's 
    a half-hour daytime show on Channel Three.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Gee,&quot; said Raeder. </p>
    <p>&quot;Don't thank me. There's a thousand dollars if you win or place second, 
    and a consolation prize of a hundred dollars if you lose. But that's not 
    important.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;No, sir.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>Spills</i> is a little show. The JBC network uses it as a testing 
    ground. First and second-place winners on <i>Spills</i> move on to <i>
    Emergency.</i> The prizes are much bigger on <i>Emergency.</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I know they are, sir.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;And if you do well on <i>Emergency,</i> there are the first-class thrill 
    shows, like <i>Hazard</i> and <i>Underwater Perils,</i> with their 
    nationwide coverage and enormous prizes. And then comes the really big time. 
    How far you go is up to you.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I'll do my best sir,&quot; Raeder said. </p>
    <p>Moulain stopped chewing gum for a moment and said, almost reverently, 
    &quot;You can do it, Jim. Just remember. You're <i>the people,</i> and <i>the 
    people</i> can do anything.&quot; </p>
    <p>The way he said it made Raeder feel momentarily sorry for Mr. Moulain, 
    who was dark and frizzy-haired and pop-eyed, and was obviously not <i>the 
    people.</i> </p>
    <p>They shook hands. Then Raeder signed a paper absolving the JBC of all 
    responsibility should he lose his life, limbs, or reason during the contest. 
    And he signed another paper exercising his rights under the Voluntary 
    Suicide Act. The law required this, and it was a mere formality. </p>
    <p>In three weeks, he appeared on <i>Spills.</i> </p>
    <p>The program followed the classic form of the automobile race. Untrained 
    drivers climbed into powerful American and European competition cars and 
    raced over a murderous twenty-mile course. Raeder was shaking with fear as 
    he slid his big Maserati into the wrong gear and took off. </p>
    <p>The race was a screaming, tire-burning nightmare. Raeder stayed back, 
    letting the early leaders smash themselves up on the counterbanked hairpin 
    turns. He crept into third place when a Jaguar in front of him swerved 
    against an Alfa-Romeo and the two cars roared into a plowed field. Raeder 
    gunned for second place on the last three miles, but couldn't find passing 
    room. An S-curve almost took him, but he fought the car back on the road, 
    still holding third. Then the lead driver broke a crankshaft in the final 
    fifty yards, and Jim ended in second place. </p>
    <p>He was now a thousand dollars ahead. He received four fan letters, and a 
    lady in Oshkosh sent him a pair of argyles. He was invited to appear on <i>
    Emergency.</i> </p>
    <p>Unlike the others, <i>Emergency</i> was not a competition-type program. 
    It stressed individual initiative. For the show, Raeder was knocked out with 
    a nonhabit-forming narcotic. He awoke in the cockpit of a small airplane, 
    cruising on autopilot at ten thousand feet. His fuel gauge showed nearly 
    empty. He had no parachute. He was supposed to land the plane. </p>
    <p>Of course, he had never flown before. </p>
    <p>He experimented gingerly with the controls, remembering that last week's 
    participant had recovered consciousness in a submarine, had opened the wrong 
    valve, and had drowned. </p>
    <p>Thousands of viewers watched spellbound as this average man, a man just 
    like themselves, struggled with the situation just as they would do. Jim 
    Raeder was <i>them.</i> Anything he could do, they could do. He was 
    representative of <i>the people.</i> </p>
    <p>Raeder managed to bring the ship down in some semblance of a landing. He 
    flipped over a few times, but his seat belt held. And the engine, contrary 
    to expectation, did not burst into flames. </p>
    <p>He staggered out with two broken ribs, three thousand dollars, and a 
    chance, when he healed, to appear on <i>Torero.</i> </p>
    <p>At last, a first-class thrill show! <i>Torero</i> paid ten thousand 
    dollars. All you had to do was kill a black Miura bull with a sword, just 
    like a real, trained matador. </p>
    <p>The fight was held in Madrid, since bullfighting was still illegal in the 
    United States. It was nationally televised. </p>
    <p>Raeder had a good cuadrilla. They liked the big, slow-moving American. 
    The picadors really leaned into their lances, trying to slow the bull for 
    him. The banderilleros tried to run the beast off his feet before driving in 
    their banderillas. And the second matador, a mournful man from Algiceras, 
    almost broke the bull's neck with fancy cape-work. </p>
    <p>But when all was said and done, it was Jim Raeder on the sand, a red 
    muleta clumsily gripped in his left hand, a sword in his right, facing a ton 
    of black, blood-streaked, wide-horned bull. </p>
    <p>Someone was shouting, &quot;Try for the lung, <i>hombre.</i> Don't be a hero, 
    stick him in the lung.&quot; But Jim only knew what the technical advisor in New 
    York had told him: Aim with the sword and go in over the horns. </p>
    <p>Over he went. The sword bounced off bone, and the bull tossed him over 
    its back. He stood up, miraculously ungouged, took another sword and went 
    over the horns again with his eyes closed. The god who protects children and 
    fools must have been watching, for the sword slid in like a needle through 
    butter, and the bull looked startled, stared at him unbelievingly, and 
    dropped like a deflated balloon. </p>
    <p>They paid him ten thousand dollars, and his broken collarbone healed in 
    practically no time. He received twenty-three fan letters, including a 
    passionate invitation from a girl in Atlantic City, which he ignored. And 
    they asked him if he wanted to appear on another show. </p>
    <p>He had lost some of his innocence. He was now fully aware that he had 
    been almost killed for pocket money. The big loot lay ahead. Now he wanted 
    to be almost killed for something worthwhile. </p>
    <p>So he appeared on <i>Underwater Perils,</i> sponsored by Fairlady's Soap. 
    In face mask, respirator, weighted belt, flippers and knife, he slipped into 
    the warm waters of the Caribbean with four other contestants, followed by a 
    cage-protected camera crew. The idea was to locate and bring up a treasure 
    which the sponsor had hidden there. </p>
    <p>Mask diving isn't especially hazardous. But the sponsor had added some 
    frills for public interest. The area was sown with giant clams, moray eels, 
    sharks of several species, giant octopuses, poison coral, and other dangers 
    of the deep. </p>
    <p>It was a stirring contest. A man from Florida found the treasure in a 
    deep crevice, but a moray eel found him. Another diver took the treasure, 
    and a shark took him. The brilliant blue-green water became cloudy with 
    blood, which photographed well on color TV. The treasure slipped to the 
    bottom, and Raeder plunged after it, popping an eardrum in the process. He 
    plucked it from the coral, jettisoned his weighted belt and made for the 
    surface. Thirty feet from the top he had to fight another diver for the 
    treasure. </p>
    <p>They feinted back and forth with their knives. The man struck, slashing 
    Raeder across the chest. But Raeder, with the self-possession of an old 
    contestant, dropped his knife and tore the man's respirator out of his 
    mouth. </p>
    <p>That did it. Raeder surfaced and presented the treasure at the standby 
    boat. It turned out to be a package of Fairlady's Soap—&quot;The Greatest 
    Treasure of All.&quot; </p>
    <p>That netted him twenty-two thousand dollars in cash and prizes, and three 
    hundred and eight fan letters, and an interesting proposition from a girl in 
    Macon, which he seriously considered. He received free hospitalization for 
    his knife slash and burst eardrum, and injections for coral infection. </p>
    <p>But best of all, he was invited to appear on the biggest of the thrill 
    shows. <i>The Prize of Peril.</i> </p>
    <p>And that was when the real trouble began … </p>
    <p>The subway came to a stop, jolting him out of his reverie. Raeder pushed 
    back his hat and observed, across the aisle, a man staring at him and 
    whispering to a stout woman. Had they recognized him? </p>
    <p>He stood up as soon as the doors opened, and glanced at his watch. He had 
    five hours to go. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <center>
    <p>·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp; </p>
    </center>
    <p><br>
    <br>
    At the Manhasset station, he stepped into a taxi and told the driver to take 
    him to New Salem. </p>
    <p>&quot;New Salem?&quot; the driver asked, looking at him in the rear-vision mirror.
    </p>
    <p>&quot;That's right.&quot; </p>
    <p>The driver snapped on his radio. &quot;Fare to New Salem. Yep, that's right.
    <i>New Salem.</i>&quot; They drove off. Raeder frowned, wondering if it had been 
    a signal. It was perfectly usual for taxi drivers to report to their 
    dispatchers, of course. But something about the man's voice … </p>
    <p>&quot;Let me off here,&quot; Raeder said. </p>
    <p>He paid the driver and began walking down a narrow country road that 
    curved through sparse woods. The trees were too small and too widely 
    separated for shelter. Raeder walked on, looking for a place to hide. </p>
    <p>There was a heavy truck approaching. He kept on walking, pulling his hat 
    low on his forehead. But as the truck drew near, he heard a voice from the 
    television set in his pocket. It cried, &quot;<i>Watch out!</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>He flung himself into the ditch. The truck careened past, narrowly 
    missing him, and screeched to a stop. The driver was shouting, &quot;There he 
    goes! Shoot, Harry, shoot!&quot; </p>
    <p>Bullets clipped leaves from the trees as Raeder sprinted into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>It's happened again!</i>&quot; Mike Terry was saying, his voice 
    high-pitched with excitement. &quot;<i>I'm afraid Jim Raeder let himself be 
    lulled into a false sense of security. You can't do that, Jim! Not with your</i> 
    life <i>at stake! Not with</i> killers <i>pursuing you! Be careful, Jim, you 
    still have four and a half hours to go!</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>The driver was saying, &quot;Claude, Harry, go around with the truck. We got 
    him boxed.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>They've got you boxed, Jim Raeder!</i>&quot; Mike Terry cried. &quot;<i>But 
    they haven't got you yet! And you can thank Good Samaritan Susy Peters of 
    twelve Elm Street, South Orange, New Jersey, for that warning shout just 
    when the truck was bearing down on you. We'll have little Susy on stage in 
    just a moment … Look, folks, our studio helicopter has arrived on the scene. 
    Now you can see Jim Raeder running, and the killers pursuing, surrounding 
    him …</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder ran through a hundred yards of woods and found himself on a 
    concrete highway, with open woods beyond. One of the killers was trotting 
    through the woods behind him. The truck had driven to a connecting road and 
    was now a mile away, coming toward him. </p>
    <p>A car was approaching from the other direction. Raeder ran into the 
    highway, waving frantically. The car came to a stop. </p>
    <p>&quot;Hurry!&quot; cried the blond young woman driving it. </p>
    <p>Raeder dived in. The woman made a U-turn on the highway. A bullet smashed 
    through the windshield. She stamped on the accelerator, almost running down 
    the lone killer who stood in the way. </p>
    <p>The car surged away before the truck was within firing range. </p>
    <p>Raeder leaned back and shut his eyes tightly. The woman concentrated on 
    her driving, watching for the truck in her rear-vision mirror. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>It's happened again!</i>&quot; cried Mike Terry, his voice ecstatic. &quot;<i>Jim 
    Raeder has been plucked again from the jaws of death, thanks to Good 
    Samaritan Janice Morrow of four three three Lexington Avenue, New York City. 
    Did you ever see anything like it, folks? The way Miss Morrow drove through 
    a fusillade of bullets and plucked Jim Raeder from the mouth of doom! Later 
    we'll interview Miss Morrow and get her reactions. Now, while Jim Raeder 
    speeds away—perhaps to safety, perhaps to further peril—we'll have a short 
    announcement from our sponsor. Don't go away! Jim's got four hours and ten 
    minutes until he's safe: anything can happen!</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Okay,&quot; the girl said. &quot;We're off the air now. Raeder, what in the hell 
    is the matter with you?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Eh?&quot; Raeder asked. The girl was in her early twenties. She looked 
    efficient, attractive, untouchable. Raeder noticed that she had good 
    features, a trim figure. And he noticed that she seemed angry. </p>
    <p>&quot;Miss,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't know how to thank you for—&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Talk straight,&quot; Janice Morrow said. &quot;I'm no Good Samaritan. I'm employed 
    by the JBC network.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;So the program had me rescued!&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Cleverly reasoned,&quot; she said. </p>
    <p>&quot;But why?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Look, this is an expensive show, Raeder. We have to turn in a good 
    performance. If our rating slips, we'll all be in the street selling candy 
    apples. And you aren't cooperating.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;What? Why?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Because you're terrible,&quot; the girl said bitterly. &quot;You're a flop, a 
    fiasco. Are you trying to commit suicide? Haven't you learned <i>anything</i> 
    about survival?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I'm doing the best I can.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The Thompsons could have had you a dozen times by now. We told them to 
    take it easy, stretch it out. But it's like shooting a clay pigeon six feet 
    tall. The Thompsons are cooperating, but they can only fake so far. If I 
    hadn't come along, they'd have had to kill you—air-time or not.&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder stared at her, wondering how such a pretty girl could talk that 
    way. She glanced at him, then quickly looked back to the road. </p>
    <p>&quot;Don't give me that look!&quot; she said. &quot;<i>You</i> chose to risk your life 
    for money, buster. And plenty of money! You knew the score. Don't act like 
    some innocent little grocer who finds the nasty hoods are after him. That's 
    a different plot.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; Raeder said. </p>
    <p>&quot;If you can't live well, at least try to die well.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;You don't mean that,&quot; Raeder said. </p>
    <p>&quot;Don't be too sure … You've got three hours and forty minutes until the 
    end of the show. If you can stay alive, fine. The boodle's yours. But if you 
    can't, at least try to give them a run for the money.&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder nodded, staring intently at her. </p>
    <p>&quot;In a few moments we're back on the air. I develop engine trouble, let 
    you off. The Thompsons go all out now. They kill you when and if they can, 
    as soon as they can. Understand?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Raeder said. &quot;If I make it, can I see you some time?&quot; </p>
    <p>She bit her lip angrily. &quot;Are you trying to kid me?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;No. I'd like to see you again. May I?&quot; </p>
    <p>She looked at him curiously. &quot;I don't know. Forget it. We're almost on. I 
    think your best bet is the woods to the right. Ready?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Yes. Where can I get in touch with you? Afterward, I mean.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Oh, Raeder, you aren't paying attention. Go through the woods until you 
    find a washed-out ravine. It isn't much, but it'll give you some cover.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Where can I get in touch with you?&quot; Raeder asked again. </p>
    <p>&quot;I'm in the Manhattan telephone book.&quot; She stopped the car. &quot;Okay, 
    Raeder, start running.&quot; </p>
    <p>He opened the door. </p>
    <p>&quot;Wait.&quot; She leaned over and kissed him on the lips. &quot;Good luck, you 
    idiot. Call me if you make it.&quot; </p>
    <p>And then he was on foot, running into the woods. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</p>

    <p><br>
    <br>
    He ran through birch and pine, past an occasional split-level house with 
    staring faces at the big picture windows. Some occupant of those houses must 
    have called the gang, for they were close behind him when he reached the 
    washed-out little ravine. Those quiet, mannerly, law-abiding people didn't 
    want him to escape, Raeder thought sadly. They wanted to see a killing. Or 
    perhaps they wanted to see him <i>narrowly escape</i> a killing. </p>
    <p>It came to the same thing, really. </p>
    <p>He entered the ravine, burrowed into the thick underbrush and lay still. 
    The Thompsons appeared on both ridges, moving slowly, watching for any 
    movement. Raeder held his breath as they came parallel to him. </p>
    <p>He heard the quick explosion of a revolver. But the killer had only shot 
    a squirrel. It squirmed for a moment, then lay still. </p>
    <p>Lying in the underbrush, Raeder heard the studio helicopter overhead. He 
    wondered if any cameras were focused on him. It was possible. And if someone 
    were watching, perhaps some Good Samaritan would help. </p>
    <p>So looking upward, toward the helicopter, Raeder arranged his face in a 
    reverent expression, clasped his hands and prayed. He prayed silently, for 
    the audience didn't like religious ostentation. But his lips moved. That was 
    every man's privilege. </p>
    <p>And a real prayer was on his lips. Once, a lipreader in the audience had 
    detected a fugitive <i>pretending</i> to pray, but actually just reciting 
    multiplication tables. No help for that man! </p>
    <p>Raeder finished his prayer. Glancing at his watch, he saw that he had 
    nearly two hours to go. </p>
    <p>And he didn't want to die. It wasn't worth it, no matter how much they 
    paid! He must have been crazy, absolutely insane to agree to such a thing …
    </p>
    <p>But he knew that wasn't true. And he remembered just how sane he had 
    been. <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    One week ago, he had been on the <i>Prize of Peril</i> stage, blinking in 
    the spotlight, and Mike Terry had shaken his hand. </p>
    <p>&quot;Now, Mr. Raeder,&quot; Terry had said solemnly, &quot;do you understand the rules 
    of the game you are about to play?&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder nodded. </p>
    <p>&quot;If you accept, Jim Raeder, you will be a <i>hunted man</i> for a week.
    <i>Killers</i> will follow you, Jim. <i>Trained</i> killers, men wanted by 
    the law for other crimes, granted immunity for this single killing under the 
    Voluntary Suicide Act. They will be trying to kill <i>you,</i> Jim. Do you 
    understand?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I understand,&quot; Raeder said. He also understood the two hundred thousand 
    dollars he would receive if he could live out the week. </p>
    <p>&quot;I ask you again, Jim Raeder. We force no man to play for stakes of 
    death.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I want to play,&quot; Raeder said. </p>
    <p>Mike Terry turned to the audience. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I have here a 
    copy of an exhaustive psychological test which an impartial psychological 
    testing firm made on Jim Raeder at our request. Copies will be sent to 
    anyone who desires them for twenty-five cents to cover the cost of mailing. 
    The test shows that Jim Raeder is sane, well-balanced and fully responsible 
    in every way.&quot; He turned to Raeder. </p>
    <p>&quot;Do you still want to enter the contest, Jim?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Very well!&quot; cried Mike Terry. &quot;Jim Raeder, meet your would-be killers!&quot;
    </p>
    <p>The Thompson gang moved on stage, booed by the audience. </p>
    <p>&quot;Look at them, folks,&quot; said Mike Terry, with undisguised contempt. &quot;Just 
    look at them! Antisocial, thoroughly vicious, completely amoral. These men 
    have no code but the criminal's warped code, no honor but the honor of the 
    cowardly hired killer. They are doomed men, doomed by our society, which 
    will not sanction their activities for long, fated to an early and 
    unglamorous death.&quot; </p>
    <p>The audience shouted enthusiastically. </p>
    <p>&quot;What have you to say, Claude Thompson?&quot; Terry asked. </p>
    <p>Claude, the spokesman of the Thompsons, stepped up to the microphone. He 
    was a thin, clean-shaved man, conservatively dressed. </p>
    <p>&quot;I figure,&quot; Claude Thompson said hoarsely, &quot;I figure we're no worse than 
    anybody. I mean, like soldiers in a war: <i>they</i> kill. And look at the 
    graft in government, and the unions. Everybody's got their graft.&quot; </p>
    <p>That was Thompson's tenuous code. But how quickly, with what precision, 
    Mike Terry destroyed the killer's rationalizations! Terry's questions 
    pierced straight to the filthy soul of the man. </p>
    <p>At the end of the interview, Claude Thompson was perspiring, mopping his 
    face with a silk handkerchief and casting quick glances at his men. </p>
    <p>Mike Terry put a hand on Raeder's shoulder. &quot;Here is the man who has 
    agreed to become your victim—if you can catch him.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;We'll catch him,&quot; Thompson said, his confidence returning. </p>
    <p>&quot;Don't be too sure,&quot; said Terry. &quot;Jim Raeder has fought wild bulls—now he 
    battles jackals. He's an average man. He's <i>the people—</i>who mean 
    ultimate doom to you and your kind.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;We'll get him,&quot; Thompson said. </p>
    <p>&quot;And one thing more,&quot; Terry said, very softly. &quot;Jim Raeder does not stand 
    alone. The folks of America are for him. Good Samaritans from all corners of 
    our great nation stand ready to assist him. Unarmed, defenseless, Jim Raeder 
    can count on the aid and goodheartedness of <i>the people,</i> whose 
    representative he is. So don't be too sure, Claude Thompson! The average men 
    are for Jim Raeder—and there are a lot of average men!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</p>

    <p><br>
    <br>
    Raeder thought about it, lying motionless in the underbrush. Yes, <i>the 
    people</i> had helped him. But they had helped the killers, too. </p>
    <p>A tremor ran through him. He had chosen, he reminded himself. He alone 
    was responsible. The psychological test had proved that. </p>
    <p>And yet, how responsible were the psychologists who had given him the 
    test? How responsible was Mike Terry for offering a poor man so much money? 
    Society had woven the noose and put it around his neck, and he was hanging 
    himself with it and calling it free will. </p>
    <p>Whose fault? </p>
    <p>&quot;Aha!&quot; someone cried. </p>
    <p>Raeder looked up and saw a portly man standing near him. </p>
    <p>The man wore a loud tweed jacket. He had binoculars around his neck and a 
    cane in his hand. </p>
    <p>&quot;Mister,&quot; Raeder whispered, &quot;please don't tell!&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Hi!&quot; shouted the portly man, pointing at Raeder with his cane. &quot;Here he 
    is!&quot; </p>
    <p>A madman thought Raeder. The damned fool must think he's playing Hare and 
    Hounds. </p>
    <p>&quot;Right over here!&quot; the man screamed. </p>
    <p>Cursing, Raeder sprang to his feet and began running. He came out of the 
    ravine and saw a white building in the distance. He turned toward it. Behind 
    him he could still hear the man. </p>
    <p>&quot;That way, over there. Look, you fools, can't you see him yet?&quot; </p>
    <p>The killers were shooting again. Raeder ran, stumbling over uneven 
    ground, past three children playing in a tree house. </p>
    <p>&quot;Here he is!&quot; the children screamed. &quot;Here he is!&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder groaned and ran on. He reached the steps of the building and saw 
    that it was a church. </p>
    <p>As he opened the door, a bullet struck him behind the right kneecap. </p>
    <p>He fell, and crawled inside the church. </p>
    <p>The television set in his pocket was saying, &quot;<i>What a finish, folks, 
    what a finish! Raeder's been hit! He's been hit, folks, he's crawling now, 
    he's in pain, but he hasn't given up! NOT Jim Raeder!</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>Raeder lay in the aisle near the altar. He could hear a child's eager 
    voice saying, &quot;He went in there, Mr. Thompson. Hurry, you can still catch 
    him!&quot; </p>
    <p>Wasn't a church considered a sanctuary? Raeder wondered. </p>
    <p>Then the door was flung open, and Raeder realized that the custom was no 
    longer observed. He gathered himself together and crawled past the altar, 
    out of the back door of the church. </p>
    <p>He was in an old graveyard. He crawled past crosses and stars, past slabs 
    of marble and granite, past stone tombs and rude wooden markers. A bullet 
    exploded on a tombstone near his head, showering him with fragments. He 
    crawled to the edge of an open grave. </p>
    <p>They had deceived him, he thought. All of those nice, average, normal 
    people. Hadn't they said he was their representative? Hadn't they sworn to 
    protect their own? But no, they loathed him. Why hadn't he seen it? Their 
    hero was the cold, blank-eyed gunman, Thompson, Capone, Billy the Kid, Young 
    Lochinvar, El Cid, Cuchulain, the man without human hopes or fears. They 
    worshipped him, that dead, implacable robot gunman, and lusted to feel his 
    foot in their face. </p>
    <p>Raeder tried to move, and slid helplessly into the open grave. </p>
    <p>He lay on his back, looking at the blue sky. Presently a black silhouette 
    loomed above him, blotting out the sky. Metal twinkled. The silhouette 
    slowly took aim. </p>
    <p>And Raeder gave up all hope forever. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>Wait, Thompson!</i>&quot; roared the amplified voice of Mike Terry. The 
    revolver wavered. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>It is one second past five o'clock! The week is up! JIM RAEDER HAS 
    WON!</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>There was pandemonium of cheering from the studio audience. </p>
    <p>The Thompson gang, gathered around the grave, looked sullen. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>He's won, friends, he's won!</i>&quot; Mike Terry cried. &quot;<i>Look, look on 
    your screen! The police have arrived, they're taking the Thompsons away from 
    their victim—the victim they could not kill. And all this is thanks to you, 
    Good Samaritans of America. Look folks, tender hands are lifting Jim Raeder 
    from the open grave that was his final refuge. Good Samaritan Janice Morrow 
    is there. Could this be the beginning of a romance? Jim seems to have 
    fainted, friends; they're giving him a stimulant. He's won two hundred 
    thousand dollars! Now we'll have a few words from Jim Raeder!</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>There was a short silence. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>That's odd,</i>&quot; said Mike Terry. &quot;<i>Folks, I'm afraid we can't hear 
    from Jim just now. The doctors are examining him. Just one moment …</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>There was a silence. Mike Terry wiped his forehead and smiled. </p>
    <p>&quot;<i>It's the strain, folks, the terrible strain. The doctor tells me … 
    Well, folks, Jim Raeder is temporarily not himself. But it's only temporary! 
    JBC is hiring the best psychiatrists and psychoanalysts in the country. 
    We're going to do everything humanly possible for this gallant boy. And 
    entirely at our own expense.</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>Mike Terry glanced at the studio clock. &quot;<i>Well, it's about time to sign 
    off, folks. Watch for the announcement of our next great thrill show. And 
    don't worry, I'm sure that very soon we'll have Jim Raeder back with us.</i>&quot;
    </p>
    <p>Mike Terry smiled, and winked at the audience. &quot;<i>He's bound to get 
    well, friends. After all, we're all pulling for him!</i>&quot; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
