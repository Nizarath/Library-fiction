        FROM PLUTO</font></b></font></p>
      <p align=left><font size="5" color="#000000" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By 
        Robert Sheckley<br>
        <font size="3">Illustration by Warren Beishir</font></font></p>
      <p align=left>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Neil 
        Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium, says, &quot;numbers do not matter 
        and memorized facts about planets do not matter. What matters is an understanding 
        of the structure and layout of the solar system.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        We will start from there. We inhabitants of what you call the Kuiper Belt 
        have a lot of facts we could give you in our own nomenclature. We could 
        tell you the size of our world, its circumference, its mass, its reflectivity. 
        All that would be in our local equivalents, which you could translate 
        into your own language, if you wanted to. But that's not what you need 
        to gain an understanding of us Plutonians. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Mr. Tyson, whom I picture as a lean, wiry, red-haired man of the foxy 
        variety, goes on to point out that the solar system can be considered 
        in five broad families: the terrestrial planets; the asteroid belt; the 
        Jovian planets; the Kuiper Belt, and the Oort Cloud. You may not be familiar 
        with the Oort Cloud. But we will leave the people of that region to speak 
        for themselves at some later time. I am here as a Plutonian, and I want 
        to say a few words about the region we inhabit: the Kuiper Belt. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        We do not call it the Kuiper belt ourselves. Gerard Kuiper, who might 
        have been a tall, heavy, red-cheeked Dutchman, never came this way, and 
        was not himself an example of what he was speaking about. He was simply 
        a man who proposed the existence of this belt. We ourselves call the Kuiper 
        belt Home, but you may not understand what we mean by that term. I want 
        to tell you a few things about it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        To understand this, we need to say something about QB1, a small icy companion 
        to our world which was discovered by the Earthmen David Jewitt, the former 
        USC linebacker, and J. Luu, a world-class middle distance runner, both 
        at the University of Hawaii. They used a telescope, of course; we Kuiperians 
        do not need any such apparatus, since QB1 is right next door to us, clearly 
        visible with the naked eye or its equivalent organ. It is a familiar little 
        world; in fact, we Plutonians use it as a vacation ground. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        QB1 is small and icy, similar in size to an asteroid. It orbits one and 
        a half times further from the sun than Neptune. This puts it pretty far 
        off the beaten track, even for us, and so we consider it a primitive world, 
        unvisited even by the ubiquitous bearded phytoplankton, those adventurers 
        of the inner solar system. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        QB1 is a great place for a holiday lodge, since it also has a lake, frozen, 
        of course, and tall green fir trees, also frozen, and imported at great 
        expense from a more temperate region whose location I am not at liberty 
        to disclose.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        This lodge at QB1 has a permanent grounds keeper, whose work is not too 
        difficult. This is fortunate since in many ways Old Alex cannot be considered 
        a living creature. Not, anyhow, as most of us understand the term. His 
        non-living nature brings out his static quality, which in turn makes it 
        difficult for him to get around with much speed. But he does his best, 
        and the work is not difficult. There is no rush in getting it done: mainly 
        a matter of getting in logs from time to time and sweeping the floors. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The Kuiperian main place, of course, is Pluto itself. There seems to be 
        some question among you as to whether or not Pluto is a planet. We have 
        sometimes wondered that ourselves. We like to think of it as a planet, 
        since the term confers a certain romantic cachet, and all of us would 
        like to think of ourselves as genuine planet dwellers. But we are as well 
        aware as you that the eccentricity of its orbit renders this suspect. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        This is no problem for us, since after all Pluto is Home and we can call 
        it a planet or an asteroid or a Kuiper Object or even mint jelly, and 
        it would be all the same. But some people care about such things, especially 
        poets and science fiction writers. The more scientifically minded among 
        us prefer Tyson's grouping into broad families. This has a certain stateliness, 
        and is less confusing. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Planet or comet, Pluto has its own civilization, its restaurants and lending 
        libraries, its dancehalls with their equivalent of bare breasted maidens. 
        We have all the equivalents to your life. Not even the common hot dog 
        is left out. We are eternally grateful to this doctrine of correspondences 
        that makes comprehension possible between unlike species on differing 
        worlds.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I wish you could see our fine cities! From the air, a thousand or so feet 
        above the ground, you can appreciate the twinkling lights of the machines 
        that deter birds, and you can also make out the dark traceries which connect 
        all of our places to each other. The flight to view the city, especially 
        for those with weak wing muscles, is not a light matter. One can used 
        propellants, of course, but they rather detract from the aesthetic effect. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        There is so much to see here! Our Museum of Natural Ice Forms is the finest 
        in the Outer Planets; the little caf» attached to it makes for pleasant 
        dining, though you might want to avoid it during the solstice. Beauty 
        Parade, in the southern part of the city, is admired by most cultured 
        tastes, and, by Transpositional Aesthetics can be enjoyed by people of 
        your race as well as mine. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Best of all, we haven't had a war since we put down the Snow People. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I was remarking on this to my wife Marguerite (not her real name) just 
        the other day. I thought that our good features would be especially prized 
        by Earth people, since they have a predilection for systems of understanding.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Marguerite,&quot; 
        I said. &quot;Do you realize that there are systems of understanding which 
        make even the most far-out and incomprehensible things understandable 
        to the meanest intelligence, and do so quickly, easily, and with no <i>mrschlagg</i>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;You 
        have said this many times,&quot; Marguerite said. &quot;But you have never defined 
        the word <i>mrschlagg</i> for me.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;<i>Mrschlagg</i> 
        is a common word in our language,&quot; I replied. &quot;It is descriptive of the 
        expression your father gets on his face when I postulate the existence 
        of the <i>drndst</i>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Neither 
        my father nor I ever understood what you mean by <i>drndst</i>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;It 
        is a common enough term. His trouble lies in a generational difference, 
        I would say.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Yes, 
        you would say that,&quot; Marguerite shot back. &quot;You and your newfangled vocabulary 
        of infinitesimals of composure.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;You 
        studied the subject yourself, in school,&quot; I reminded her.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Everyone 
        studied it. It is required. But that does not make it comprehensible.&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Everyone 
        in the top nine mastered it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;You 
        know I have never been a top nine,&quot; Marguerite retorted. &quot;There you go 
        again with your elitist talk!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;My 
        dear, I intended no such thing. Can't we get along for one day?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;I 
        don't see how, the way you carry on.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        It was the sort of situation that comes up in all households. Quickly 
        I proposed a session of ice-skating on the Long Pond. Marguerite accepted, 
        reluctantly at first. But when I pummeled her with the round little rocks 
        she loves so well, our day was complete and another catastrophe averted. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        I was able to return home and complete my message to you Earth people, 
        with my compliments to Mr. Tyson, my prayers to your god Einstein, and 
        my best wishes to your well-known Mr. Kuiper.</font></p>
