DEEP BLUE SLEEP<BR>
<BR>
THERE WAS A SUDDEN SNAPPY rapping sound at Gerson's door, 
followed by a sort of<BR>
inflamed and frenzied tintinnabulation of the doorbell that would not 
be denied.<BR>
It was just plain bad timing, because Gerston had been on the verge of plunging
<BR>
into SnuggleDown, the Deep Blue Sleep program provided by the good people at<BR>
Unconscious 
Adventures Unlimited for those who wanted some fun during the hours<BR>
normally reserved for 
zilch.<BR>
<BR>
Excitement, thrills, love, laughter, all these could be yours while you slept!<BR>
Things 
had changed a lot since the bad old days when at some time in every<BR>
twenty-four hours you 
had to lie down in a darkened room and let your mind go<BR>
into a holding pattern for eight or 
so hours.<BR>
<BR>
Until recently, mankind was enslaved to sleep, that ancient enemy of our days<BR>
and 
nights that condemned us to spend a third of our lives just hanging around<BR>
doing nothing, 
and without anything to show for it but vague and generally<BR>
unsatisfactory dreams that 
needed highly paid experts to render them even<BR>
slightly intelligible.<BR>
<BR>
Then along came the 
Deep Blue Sleep programs.<BR>
<BR>
At last waking entry could be made into the mysterious kingdom of 
Mind, and this<BR>
could be accomplished by ordinary people, not just college grads with a 
Masters<BR>
or better in Psychedelic Psychology.<BR>
<BR>
In this brave new world you could even earn a 
living while asleep, as a<BR>
dreammaster, for example, or, if that position was filled, there 
was always room<BR>
for a dreamslave. And this was a considerable boon for those who were 
unable to<BR>
earn anything while awake.<BR>
<BR>
The possibilites for inner travel were little short of 
amazing. Using the<BR>
automated electronic services available at a price most middle-class 
citizens<BR>
could afford, and lower classes aspire to, you could log onto SnuggleDown and<BR>
plug 
the old psyche into a Personalized Sleep Corridor that would take you all<BR>
the way to the 
Gates (frequently described as tall and made of iron) of Death.<BR>
This became a considerable 
tourist attraction, and some daring couples even<BR>
opted for marriage in the Oblivion Zone. 
They were advised not to tarry there<BR>
too long, however, since death was still not 
completely under the Company's<BR>
control, and individual safety could not be guaranteed, even 
though the Company<BR>
took every precaution.<BR>
<BR>
Gerston had no interest in going to see the Gates 
of Death. That could wait<BR>
until he was in a morbid mood. He passed up on the Waterfall of 
Creative<BR>
Endeavor, too, figuring his productive period might as well wait until later,<BR>
since 
right now he was modeling Procrastination. He didn't even want to see the<BR>
Eternal Life 
exhibition, where the Company had created a great composite<BR>
jellyfish which it kept in a 
shallow lagoon in southern Florida.<BR>
<BR>
The jellyfish was a composite entity made up of the 
life-essences of thousands,<BR>
soon to be millions, of subscribers, who had opted for 
something comfortable and<BR>
not too demanding as a way of spending eternity.<BR>
<BR>
And there were 
other possibilities. For a little extra you could add on the<BR>
Limbo Walkers service that 
would take your mind out from time to time and show<BR>
it a nice time in the country before 
putting it back into the undying jellyfish.<BR>
<BR>
There were other interesting things to do while 
asleep. They were listed on the<BR>
Extra Services menu and cost a little more. Gerston had 
chosen one of those,<BR>
opting for a deluxe interior adventure. He was ready to begin, but 
first he had<BR>
to take care of whoever was at the door.<BR>
<BR>
The loud doorbell shried again, and 
Gerston called out, "Who's there?"<BR>
<BR>
"Thought-o-gram for Mr. Grumpton."<BR>
<BR>
"Gerston?"<BR>
<BR>
"What I 
said."<BR>
<BR>
"Who's it from?" Gerson asked, because he led a quiet life and hardly ever<BR>
received 
thought-o-grams or their near-cousins, intuition-flashes.<BR>
<BR>
"Hey, buddy, you wanna know what 
color it is too and does it smell nice? Whyncha<BR>
accept it and see for yourself? You catch 
my drift or am I vistling spitzie?"<BR>
<BR>
Gerston had never liked the rudeness of what used to be 
called the lower classes<BR>
and now weren't referred to at all. If he didn't answer, the 
fellow would<BR>
undoubtedly go away. Still, Gerston wanted to know who had sent him a<BR>
thought-o-gram 
and so he unchained the door and opened it. Standing in front of<BR>
him was a small individual 
wearing a khaki uniform and a cap on which was<BR>
written Mercury Thought-Transfer Service.
<BR>
<BR>
"Do I have to sign for this thought-o-gram?" Gerston asked.<BR>
<BR>
"Naw, just signify assent by an 
act of mental volition and it will be so noted<BR>
on the mind-sensitive receipt form which I 
carry in this small leather pouch."<BR>
<BR>
Gerston signified, and the messenger said, "Here you 
are," and touched Gerston's<BR>
forehead with a transistorized forefinger.<BR>
<BR>
Gerston felt the 
familiar flash of transmission and waited for the message to<BR>
appear in his mind. But it 
didn't. Instead he felt a strange interior sort of a<BR>
movement. It took him half a beat to 
realize what this was. Something was<BR>
stirring and moving inside his mind.<BR>
<BR>
Gerston's first 
thought was a compact squeamish sensation for which there is no<BR>
precise verbal equivalent. 
Somebody was in his mind!<BR>
<BR>
"Hi," a woman's voice in his head said.<BR>
<BR>
"What?" Gerston replied.
<BR>
<BR>
"I said `hi.'"<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, but who are you?"<BR>
<BR>
"I'm Myra."<BR>
<BR>
"Is that supposed to mean something to 
me?"<BR>
<BR>
"You invited me here, don't you remember?"<BR>
<BR>
"I did?" Gerston said. "The details are a 
little dim. Perhaps if you could just<BR>
remind me of the circumstances`"<BR>
<BR>
"It was in the letter 
you wrote me. `If you're ever in these parts, do drop in.'<BR>
That sounds like an invitation 
to me. What was I supposed to do, go to Siberia?"<BR>
<BR>
"I'm afraid I don't remember," Gerston 
said. "But the thing I don't understand<BR>
is, why didn't you just come visit me in the normal 
fashion?"<BR>
<BR>
"Because I thought this would be a fun thing to do."<BR>
<BR>
"I see."<BR>
<BR>
"But you hate it, 
don't you?"<BR>
<BR>
"Well..."<BR>
<BR>
"So I made a mistake. So sue me. So I'll go kill myself."<BR>
<BR>
"Myra, 
there's no need to be melodramatic. Of course I'm glad to see you. Well,<BR>
it's not exactly 
seeing, but you know what I mean. It's just that I don't<BR>
usually entertain people in my 
head."<BR>
<BR>
"Don't you ever get lonely in there all by yourself?"<BR>
<BR>
"Of course I do. But I still 
don't -- "<BR>
<BR>
"I know, you still don't entertain people in your head. Well, don't worry, I<BR>
don't 
hang around where I'm not wanted. Where did that delivery boy go? He said<BR>
he'd come back 
for me. At least I think that's what he said. It was a little<BR>
hard making out what he was 
saying, you know?"<BR>
<BR>
"But you pretended you did?"<BR>
<BR>
"Sure. I don't like to hurt people's 
feelings, Harold."<BR>
<BR>
"What did you call me?"<BR>
<BR>
"I called you Harold, of course."<BR>
<BR>
"I'm not 
Harold."<BR>
<BR>
"But of course you are!"<BR>
<BR>
"Hey, I ought to know who I am. I'm Sid, that's who I am."
<BR>
<BR>
"Sid what?"<BR>
<BR>
"Sid Gerston, of course."<BR>
<BR>
"You're sure?"<BR>
<BR>
"Of course I'm sure."<BR>
<BR>
"Not Harold 
Greeston?"<BR>
<BR>
"No!"<BR>
<BR>
"Then that idiot delivered me to the wrong mind!"<BR>
<BR>
There was a short pause 
while Gerston tried to think.<BR>
<BR>
"As long as you're here," Gerston said at last, "I guess you 
might as well make<BR>
yourself comfortable."<BR>
<BR>
"Thanks." There was movement in Gerston's mind, 
and then a sort of plop, as of<BR>
someone sitting down. "Nice place you got here."<BR>
<BR>
"Well, it's 
just my mind, of course, but I try to keep it nice. Some might<BR>
consider it a little 
austere."<BR>
<BR>
"A little what?"<BR>
<BR>
"Stiff."<BR>
<BR>
"No, I think it's real nice. You sure got a lot of books 
in here!"<BR>
<BR>
"Well, I think having a library in one's mind is important."<BR>
<BR>
"How come these 
titles blur out when I try to read them?"<BR>
<BR>
"It's just the ones I haven't read that blur out 
that way."<BR>
<BR>
"And what's this here? A kitchen?"<BR>
<BR>
"A virtual kitchen, actually. I thought it 
would be rather fun, if you know what<BR>
I mean."<BR>
<BR>
"But what do you do with it?"<BR>
<BR>
"Well, you can 
eat by merely reading the recipe you want. They're all right here<BR>
in this book."<BR>
<BR>
"Wow, 
that's a big book!"<BR>
<BR>
"It's the Encyclopedia of All Encyclopedias of All Recipes Ever 
Conceived Since<BR>
the Beginning of the World, Together with Their Main Variations. As you can
<BR>
imagine, it's pretty thorough."<BR>
<BR>
"Must have been expensive."<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, but well worth it, 
especially with its Length of Meal option which lets<BR>
you set Ingestion Duration anywhere 
from 5 nanoseconds all the way up to 18<BR>
hours for feasts you really want to linger over. 
And the Intensity scale has an<BR>
orgasmic level that's new this year. It makes a good meal 
just that much more<BR>
enjoyable."<BR>
<BR>
"Too bad I'm not hungry."<BR>
<BR>
"You don't have to be. I also have 
a Virtual Hunger program that will give you<BR>
all the appetite you could want."<BR>
<BR>
"I don't want 
to be hungry right now. I'll just wander around a little more,<BR>
thank you. What's this, a 
broom closet?"<BR>
<BR>
"I like to keep things clean."<BR>
<BR>
"In your mind?"<BR>
<BR>
"Of course. Virtual cleanliness 
is just as important as the real thing."<BR>
<BR>
"Have you got a bathroom here?"<BR>
<BR>
"What would I be 
doing with a bathroom in my mind? And what would you need it<BR>
for?"<BR>
<BR>
"A virtual bathroom will 
do just as well. My, what a lot of doors. And what is<BR>
this? A winding staircase! I wonder 
where it leads."<BR>
<BR>
"Don't go down there!"<BR>
<BR>
"Take it easy. I always enjoy looking around men's 
minds. Now this is<BR>
interesting. It gets darker as I go down."<BR>
<BR>
"Stay out of there! That 
staircase leads to the recesses of my mind. Can't you<BR>
read the sign? It says, `Unconscious 
Level. Entry Strictly Forbidden Except to<BR>
Licensed Psychotherapists.' I will thank you to 
keep your nose out of my<BR>
personal private business."<BR>
<BR>
"Come on, don't be such a spoilsport. 
I'm down there already. I just want a peek<BR>
at what's behind this odd little door..."<BR>
<BR>
"Don't 
touch that door!"<BR>
<BR>
"Don't get so excited. What makes you think you got anything I ain't seen
<BR>
before?"<BR>
<BR>
"SHUT THAT DOOR!"<BR>
<BR>
There was the virtual sound of a door opening. Then Myra said, 
"Greck!"<BR>
<BR>
"I beg your pardon?" Gersten said.<BR>
<BR>
"`Greck' is the sort of expression my ex-husband 
Hubert used when he came across<BR>
something especially nasty. I think what I just saw 
qualifies."<BR>
<BR>
"I don't want to talk about it."<BR>
<BR>
"I should think not. You are a dirty bit of 
business, aren't you?"<BR>
<BR>
"I'm perfectly normal. All men's heads have cellar rooms like that."
<BR>
<BR>
"You know, I don't think you know men's heads very well. The last guy's head I<BR>
was in, it 
was just one big room, you know? No upstairs or downstairs. And this<BR>
room was empty except 
for a pile of stuff in one corner. Do you know what it<BR>
was?"<BR>
<BR>
"Women's dismembered bodies?"
<BR>
<BR>
"Golf trophies! Isn't that a scream?"<BR>
<BR>
"I see nothing funny about it. Get out of my 
Unconscious!"<BR>
<BR>
"In a moment."<BR>
<BR>
"What are you doing now?"<BR>
<BR>
"Looking around. This doorway 
here...It leads to the Pleasure Center! I knew you<BR>
had to have one! Everyone's got one!"
<BR>
<BR>
"Leave my Pleasure Center alone! And what do you mean, everybody's got one ?"<BR>
<BR>
"Well, 
everybody whose head I've been in."<BR>
<BR>
"What were you doing in other men's Pleasure Centers?"
<BR>
<BR>
"Well, you know. Someone hires you to go into their Pleasure Center, you don't<BR>
spend a 
whole lot of time asking them what they want you to do there, you know<BR>
what I mean?"<BR>
<BR>
"I'm 
not sure."<BR>
<BR>
"Want me to spell it out?"<BR>
<BR>
"No! Why do you do that sort of thing?"<BR>
<BR>
"Well, it's a 
job, you know?"<BR>
<BR>
"No, I don't know!"<BR>
<BR>
"You've led a sheltered life."<BR>
<BR>
"So what do you do when 
you get into a guy's head?"<BR>
<BR>
Myra hesitated, then said, "Look, maybe we shouldn't talk about 
this."<BR>
<BR>
"No, no, it's all right, tell me."<BR>
<BR>
"You're not going to like it... Okay, a guy 
usually asks me to sit down, make<BR>
myself comfortable. Sometimes he offers me a drink. It's 
not a real drink, of<BR>
course, it's a virtual drink, but it helps break the ice. Sometimes 
he'll offer<BR>
me a joint or two, or a couple of snorts of coke."<BR>
<BR>
"That's against the law."<BR>
<BR>
"Real 
coke is, but not virtual coke."<BR>
<BR>
"What do you do then?"<BR>
<BR>
"We fool around a little."<BR>
<BR>
"What do 
you mean, you fool around? There aren't any bodies involved, what can<BR>
you do?"<BR>
<BR>
"I'm trying 
to tell you, aren't I? What's this?"<BR>
<BR>
"Wait a minute, what are you doing?"<BR>
<BR>
"It looks so nice 
and pink in here. I think I'll just touch it..."<BR>
<BR>
"Don't touch anything!"<BR>
<BR>
"Whassa matter, 
don't you like being touched?"<BR>
<BR>
"Not by people who are in my mind without my permission, no! 
What are you doing<BR>
now?"<BR>
<BR>
"It's so nice here, I think I'll just take a little nap. Catch you 
in a few<BR>
minutes, lover."<BR>
<BR>
GERSTON WAS in a high state of nervous perplexity. He didn't know 
what to do.<BR>
And just to make it worse, at that moment there was a violent knocking sound at
<BR>
the apartment door, the real one, not the virtual one. Gerston knew at once by<BR>
its slightly 
hollow sound and over-determined air of realism that it was even<BR>
more trouble coming his 
way. And that was really too much.<BR>
<BR>
"I'm busy!" he shouted. "Go away!"<BR>
<BR>
"Open the door," a 
voice said, "before we kick it in. This is the Thought<BR>
Police."<BR>
<BR>
"I never heard of the 
Thought Police. Are you sure -- "<BR>
<BR>
"Of course I'm sure, dummy. Open this door or we'll break 
it down and kick your<BR>
forehead in."<BR>
<BR>
"You have no right!" Gerson cried. "It's not legal!"<BR>
<BR>
"The 
hell it's not! We have a search warrant that permits us to invade your<BR>
house, and another 
that allows us ingress to your mind."<BR>
<BR>
"But why are you doing this?<BR>
<BR>
"We have information that 
you are harboring a dangerous criminal."<BR>
<BR>
"In my apartment?"<BR>
<BR>
"Don't play dumb with me, 
sucker! You're hiding her in your mind!"<BR>
<BR>
Gerston took a moment off from his panic to 
wonder, how could they know that?<BR>
"Don't be silly," he said, fighting for time, space, air. 
"I'd never do that."<BR>
<BR>
"We know she's in there. An alien sex criminal from a faraway planet. 
A sex<BR>
criminal who calls herself Myra. Am I getting through to you? Do yourself a<BR>
favor, 
buddy. It's probably not your fault. Let us in and we'll get this cleared<BR>
up quicklike."
<BR>
<BR>
Gerston said, in a deadened voice, "I swear I didn't know she was a criminal.<BR>
All right, 
come on in, officers."<BR>
<BR>
He unlocked the apartment door. Three bulky officers in dark blue 
uniforms came<BR>
in. They wore silver badges on their shirts which read Thought Police, Squad
<BR>
Three. One of them wore sergeant's stripes.<BR>
<BR>
"Permission to enter?" the sergeant said, 
tapping Gerston's forehead with a<BR>
squat forefinger.<BR>
<BR>
"Go ahead, you're going to do it 
anyway."<BR>
<BR>
The doors of Gerston's mind opened. The three policemen entered in a flurry of<BR>
virtual 
black leather jackets and calf-length jackboots. Their feet were dirty<BR>
and their faces 
grim. They were frightening despite their virtuality.<BR>
<BR>
"It's too crowded, please hurry!" 
Gerston cried.<BR>
<BR>
The policemen searched through Gerston's mind. They swept memory-objects off
<BR>
simulated shelves and knocked down the portraits of ancestors so remote that<BR>
Gerston hadn't 
known he had them. Their boots made marks on the pink<BR>
scuff-sensitive surface of Gerston's 
mind. Their crude remarks lingered near the<BR>
virtual ceiling like clouds of ill-smelling 
gas.<BR>
<BR>
"Is this going to take long?" Gerston asked through gritted teeth.<BR>
<BR>
"Better get used to 
it," the sergeant said.<BR>
<BR>
There was a crash. "Sorry, chief," one of the policemen said. "I 
dropped one of<BR>
his golf trophies."<BR>
<BR>
"She's not here," another policeman reported. "We've 
searched all of the way<BR>
down to the rotting depths of the stupid insanity he calls his 
deepest self.<BR>
We'd a found her if she'd been hiding there."<BR>
<BR>
"Damnation!" the sergeant said. 
"She got away again! But at least we got you,<BR>
sucker."<BR>
<BR>
They exited Gerston's mind. A smile 
of great amusement appeared on the<BR>
sergeant's tough cop face with the little busted red 
veins and the tufted<BR>
eyebrows.<BR>
<BR>
Gerston opened his mouth to speak. Suddenly he froze. 
Everything around him was<BR>
arrested in mid-motion. There was a flash of light.<BR>
<BR>
The policemen 
disappeared. Gerston goggled, unable to make sense out of this.<BR>
<BR>
And then a voice spoke in 
his head.<BR>
<BR>
"Hi!" the voice said. "We have interrupted your entry into Deep Blue Sleep to<BR>
bring 
you a preview of our unlimited psychic adventures for the young at heart.<BR>
Did you enjoy 
what you just experienced? Want more like it? Just signify your<BR>
assent. Trained operators 
will pick up your inference and put the charge on your<BR>
credit card."<BR>
<BR>
So that was what all 
this was, Gerston thought. This was outrageous!<BR>
<BR>
Aloud he said, "I demand to see someone in 
charge."<BR>
<BR>
A tall thin man with glinting spectacles appeared in his mind.<BR>
<BR>
"Supervisor Olson at 
your service. Is there a problem?"<BR>
<BR>
"Damned well right there's a problem! I never chose any 
psychic adventure<BR>
program. A little sleep was all I was after! And even if I had selected 
an<BR>
adventure, what right did you have to humiliate me by sending this Myra person<BR>
to invade 
my mind? And what was this police thing?"<BR>
<BR>
The supervisor said, "Let me just look at your 
record, sir."<BR>
<BR>
Swiftly he plucked a card out of Gerson's mind, read it, replaced it.<BR>
<BR>
"It's 
all right, sir, we do have your assent, right here. That is your<BR>
signature, isn't it?"<BR>
<BR>
Gerston 
squinted. "It looks like it. But I never agreed to anything like this."<BR>
<BR>
"But you did, sir. 
I hope you won't force me to tell you when you in fact signed<BR>
for the service."<BR>
<BR>
"Go ahead, 
tell me!"<BR>
<BR>
"It was just before you died."<BR>
<BR>
"I'm dead?" Gerston asked.<BR>
<BR>
"That is the case, sir."
<BR>
<BR>
"But how could I be dead?"<BR>
<BR>
The supervisor shrugged. "It happens."<BR>
<BR>
"If I'm dead," Gerston 
said, "how come I'm still here?"<BR>
<BR>
"We have our ways of keeping the dead alive."<BR>
<BR>
"I don't want 
to be dead!" Gerston wailed.<BR>
<BR>
"Sir, please be quiet, you'll wake up the others."<BR>
<BR>
"The others? 
What others?"<BR>
<BR>
But the supervisor was gone and the lights were beginning to fade.<BR>
<BR>
Lights in 
his own apartment? In his mind? Fading? At first he thought he was<BR>
going to die. Then he 
remembered he was already dead. Or were they lying to him<BR>
about that? And if this was 
death, what lay beyond it? And anyhow, how could he<BR>
be sure he was dead? Might this not 
just be the continuation of one of their<BR>
dream adventures? It would be just like them to 
lie to him, tell him he was<BR>
dead, when actually he was just...just...<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly Gerston 
didn't know what to think. For now something rather strange<BR>
seemed to be taking place.<BR>
<BR>
