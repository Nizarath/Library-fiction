          the name. I am a fairly well-known psychologist, well off, and with 
          a respectable list of publications. Maybe you've read my popular book, 
          "The Dream of Misunderstanding." It has helped a lot of people. I know 
          a lot about misunderstanding. Despite this, I have a lot of trouble 
          helping myself. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          As a matter of fact, my wife and I are separated. I live in my office 
          on New York's East Side, Myra is in our family apartment on the West 
          Side. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          My own books, excellent though they are generally accounted to be, have 
          failed to get my wife to understand me. I have been brooding a lot over 
          that lately. Maybe that accounts for my dream.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          In my dream, I was standing in a bluish room with no furniture. In front 
          of me was a man larger than lifesize. He had a noble beard, and seemed 
          very worthy of respect. </font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Well," 
          he said, "So you finally made it all the way to me."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Who 
          are you?" I said.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
          am Ahriman, subdiety in charge of Earthly solutions."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
          solution are you talking about?"</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"A 
          solution to the membrane problem."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And 
          what is that?"</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The 
          membrane is what separates one thing from another on your Earth. It 
          is invisible to human eyes, but it is there all the same. It is the 
          equivalent of a thick, semi-transparent substance that coats the world 
          and separates one person's understanding from another's."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This 
          membrane," I said. "I believe it is unknown to science?"</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That 
          is true."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What 
          is the effect of this membrane?" I asked.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It 
          interferes with human relations. It is the barrier, invisible but palpable, 
          that prevents anyone from really understanding anyone else."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That's 
          a big problem," I said. "I've often thought about this, using different 
          metaphors."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We 
          are aware that you have worked all your professional life on the problem 
          of human misunderstanding."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Without 
          much success."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
          wouldn't say that. We are aware of your publications on the subject 
          of the impossibility of one person really understanding another. Your 
          books do a good job of describing life as it is lived behind the membrane." 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
          have proven that understanding is a difficult thing. But to prove a 
          negative is negligible."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Not 
          at all. Your attempts constitute a notable achievement."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"My 
          attempts at clarification have only succeeded in muddying up my own 
          situation."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"With 
          the ability imparted by this parchment, you can clear up misunderstandings, 
          which are all that separate one person from another."</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          He handed me a parchment. On it was written, "Charles Brenton is now 
          granted the ability to pass through the membranes that separate mind 
          from mind." </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I couldn't read the signature, but it was bold and black and somehow 
          looked holy.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I took the parchment in my hand. A feeling of competence and rightness 
          came over me. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          The parchment shrunk and flew from my hand into my head. It was glorious 
          to feel it there. My image of my own rightness increased. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          The subgod said, "Are you sure you know what to do with it?"</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I 
          know," I said.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Anything 
          you want to run over with me?"</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No, 
          I've got it. Many thanks, and I'll get to work immediately."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'll 
          leave you to it, then."</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I saw in a flash what needed to be done. God knows I had written about 
          it often enough. The world was filled with misunderstandings. Ignorant 
          and misinformed armies clashed by night, innocent women and children 
          were killed, dictators and terrorists reigned. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          There was work to be done with all of that and much more. On an international 
          level. </font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">²nd 
          there were many problems in America, too. There were some things I badly 
          needed to tell our President, and have him understand them. I saw them 
          all. The parchment in my head gave me the ability to do that. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          There was work to be done, and no time to lose.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          But first, I thought I'd begin with a situation nearer to home. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Light as air, I flew out of my apartment window and across town. I crossed 
          Central Park, and admired the lights along the roadways. Across Central 
          Park West, then I turned uptown for a few blocks, and then west again. 
          I saw Myra's apartment building ahead. It used to be mine, too. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I entered through a long-remembered window. Like a breath of wind I 
          moved through the rooms. I found my wife asleep in her bed. Alone in 
          her room. I paused a moment to admire her beauty. Then, pursuant to 
          the instructions of the subdiety as I understood then, I entered her 
          mind. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          The membrane at the threshhold held me back for a moment. Without Ahriman's 
          parchment, I couldn't have done it. As it was, I feared the parchment 
          might not work. But I found myself passing through it slowly, turning 
          myself into something infinitesimal, ions, electrons--except for psychology 
          I have no scientific training. Anyhow, I passed through the membrane.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Once on the other side, I reconstituted myself. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I was in a corridor that curved far away into the distance. It was lined 
          with filing cabinets, which held the banks of dicta Myra lived by. These 
          were the commands that she gave herself, the judgments she made, and 
          most of them followed the commands set down from childhood. There were 
          many she had not altered since that time.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Her mind to me was a long labyrinthine path that wound slowly into the 
          interior of her soul. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I had gotten through the membrane. I was in another person's mind! I 
          was in my wife's mind.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I passed the secret place where she kept her ideas about herself. I 
          was tempted to look at them and do a little rearranging. But a tact 
          I hadn't thought myself capable of kept me from it. I continued down 
          the corridor.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Soon I came to where her memories of me were stored. These I scanned 
          with some care.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I felt horror at the interlocking logic of those thoughts, those impressions. 
          I knew she had once loved me, once thought highly of me. How could it 
          have changed into this? How could she have thought I thought that? I 
          would never have accused my worst enemy of the thoughts and emotions 
          she assigned to me. "Cold" and "prissy" was the least of it. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Very gently I began readjusting her attitudes toward me. </font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Basic 
          liking" needed some tweaking to bring it up to a proper level. "Appreciation 
          of his looks" needed a little more adjustment. "Approval of deeds as 
          understood from motives" required a lot of attention. "Perception of 
          gallantry" also took some work. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          There were other things to adjust. I reversed a number of her perceptions 
          so that she would wake up realizing they were misperceptions. I wanted 
          her to think, "Oh, I don't know how I could have gotten him so wrong..." 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Frankly, I wasn't too sure I had indeed meant what I wanted her to believe 
          I'd meant, but if I was going to err, it would be in my own favor.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I saw her turn in her sleep, smile, reach toward me. For a moment I 
          thought there was hope. But then a spasm shook her body. She rolled 
          away, and still asleep, her face twisted in disgust. She shuddered. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Get 
          out of me!" she cried, still asleep. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Obviously, my actions had stirred up a rebellion in her. In the unconscious, 
          I suppose. I watched her reject the alien thoughts. My thoughts, my 
          adjustments! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          She couldn't bear to see me through my eyes, from my point of view.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I realized that even if I had created a truer version of myself, it 
          wasn't her truth, wasn't true for her, and maybe had never been true, 
          maybe never could be true. This despite my good intentions. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          The repair work I had done in her mind began to shake and quiver. Each 
          place I had touched turned a dark and unpleasant color. In that darkness 
          I saw the rejection of my own valuations, my own desired self-images 
          that I had tried to impose on her. She threw them off as alien matter. 
          Shame-faced, my self-conceptions had crept back inside of me.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          In the midst of this, I had another vision. A vision within a vision, 
          as it were. I caught a glimpse of that universal mind, owned by no one 
          and everyone, to which few are given access. I saw all our differences 
          reconciled. But this too faded away. Apparently this ultimate reconciliation 
          with the person I loved was not allowed by the ground rules of existence. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Shortly after that, I was expelled from her mind.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Her interior filing cabinets were shaking and quaking. The corridor 
          itself writhed. The interior of her mind suddenly semed to knot, then 
          explode outward with an irresistable force. I was thrown from her mind 
          against the membrane. I passed through as before, and came out the other 
          side intact.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Someone was standing there, waiting for me. It was the Ahriman, the 
          subgod who had given me the parchment. Now he plucked it out of my head. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Ahriman said, "Apparently you didn't understand the gift. It's not to 
          be used for yourself. You give it to someone else. The gift to give 
          is to be able to understand, not to be understood."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You 
          didn't tell me that."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"You 
          didn't ask. You said you knew what to do."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Why 
          did you give it to me in the first place, among all the people you could 
          have given it to? You must have known from the start that I was damaged."</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We 
          can only give the parchment to the damaged ones," he said. "Unfortunately, 
          being damaged, they don't use it correctly."</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          So that was the end of it. When I woke up in my bedroom, I could find 
          no sign of the parchment, and luckily I had the sense to tell no one 
          about it, until now, in the form of a fictitious story.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I have never again heard from Ahriman.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          If I had it to do over, I think I'd start changing the minds of dictators. 
          Adjusting their political and social attitudes seems an easier task 
          than trying to solve those of the secrets of a human heart. </font></p>
