<H2>Robert Sheckley, `Aspects of Langranak'</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>1</H3></CENTER>
<P>I can't describe this place without describing me. Nor can I describe me 
without telling you about the place. But which should I start with? Perhaps I 
ought to describe both of us together. But I doubt if I could manage that. 
Perhaps I am incapable of describing anything. 
<P>Still, I <EM>am</EM> on an alien planet -- a situation which is commonly 
considered interesting. And I am an individual, which is also supposed to be 
interesting. And I am certainly capable of writing down my impressions. I don't 
know why I can't bring it all together. 
<P>Perhaps I should start with a description of my inability to describe 
anything. But I seem to have done that, for whatever it's worth. 
<CENTER>
<H3>2</H3></CENTER>
<P>I think I will start with spires. 
<P>The main city here is called Langranak. It is notable for its spires. From 
the vantage-point of a hill some five miles outside the city, the aspect is one 
of a multiplicity of spires. They are all shapes and sizes and colours. I have 
been told that Venice also has many spires, and Istanbul as well. Spires present 
a pleasing aesthetic pattern, no matter what their arrangement. The spires of 
Langranak present a definitely alien aspect. I think that is all I have to say 
about spires. 
<CENTER>
<H3>3</H3></CENTER>
<P>I am individual from Earth of average size and shape. I suppose I am like a 
lot of people. I am unusual in that I am on an alien planet. 
<P>I spend most of my time inside the spaceship. Great pains were taken to make 
this spaceship homelike and cosy. The main lounge looks like Holiday Inn. The 
galley is reminiscent of a Howard Johnson's, and the bedroom might have been 
taken from a New England country inn. I feel pretty good in this spaceship. I 
used to laugh at American decor, but I don't any longer. I like my spaceship 
very much just as it is. The hot dogs are from Nathan's. Only the hot buttered 
corn on the cob is not up to Earth standards. They still haven't licked that 
problem. 
<CENTER>
<H3>4</H3></CENTER>
<P>Nothing much happens here. That is the part I wanted to avoid mentioning. My 
idea of a story is that it should have adventure and conflict and problems and 
resolutions. That's the kind of story I like to read. But nothing much happens 
to me. Here I am on an alien planet surrounded by alien beings, and nothing much 
happens to me. Nevertheless, I still believe I have a story here. Christ knows, 
I have all of the ingredients. 
<CENTER>
<H3>5</H3></CENTER>
<P>Yesterday I had an interview with the chief magistrate of Langranak. We 
discussed transspatial friendship. We both agreed that our races ought to be 
friends. We also talked about interstellar trade, which we both agreed upon in 
principle. But in fact, there doesn't seem to be much that we have that they 
want, and vice-versa. Not enough to justify the high freighting costs. I mean, 
they have a whole planet in which to manufacture what they need, and so do we. 
So we had to merely agree in principle. 
<P>We had more progress when we talked about a tourist interchange programme. 
These people like to travel, and so do our people. The costs would be extremely 
high, but some people could afford it. Anyhow, it would be a beginning. 
<CENTER>
<H3>6</H3></CENTER>
<P>I sit in my spaceship and do a lot of reading. I read many books on Zen 
Buddhism, and also on Yoga and on Tibetan and Hindu mysticism. `Enter the 
silence as often as possible, stay in it as long as possible'. That's what it's 
all about, really. Methods of stopping your mind from chattering. 
`One-pointedness'. I want all of that very much, but my mind refuses to stay 
still. I have random thoughts, emotions, sensations. Sometimes I can control all 
of that for five minutes at a time. But that doesn't give me much of a feeling 
of accomplishment. I suppose I need a guru. But that is impossible due to my 
circumstances. I thought about making inquiries here for a teacher. But I won't 
be here long enough to make it worthwhile. It always seems to be that way. 
<CENTER>
<H3>7</H3></CENTER>
<P>Nothing seems very strange here, really. People buy things and sell things. 
They work at various jobs. There are a few beggars. It all seems quite 
comprehensible. I don't understand everything, of course; but I don't understand 
everything at home, either. I wish I could say, `What these people do about this 
is simply incredible'. But nothing strikes me as especially incredible. They go 
about their work and live their lives, and I do the same, and it all seems 
pretty normal. I have to keep on reminding myself that I am on an alien planet. 
Not that I can ever forget it, of course. It's just that I can't seem to get 
into the sense o wonder. 
<CENTER>
<H3>8</H3></CENTER>
<P>Last night there was an eclipse. I had planned to go out and see it but fall 
asleep over a book and missed the thing. Not that it matters. The ship's cameras 
recored it automatically and I'll catch it on replay. 
<CENTER>
<H3>9</H3></CENTER>
<P>I pulled myself together today and went out to visit the ruins. People have 
been urging me to see them. I am very glad that I went. The ruins, which are 
believed to be of a civilisation some thousands of years vanished, are situated 
approximately ten miles from the outskirts of Langranak. They are very 
extensive. They were covered with intricate carving and bas-relief figures of 
various creatures which my guide told me do not literally exist. There also were 
statues, quite grotesque and stylised. The guide said that these had once been 
worshipped as gods, but were no longer. There were also several labyrinths which 
once had a religious significance. 
<P>I took photographs of all of these things. Light conditions were average. I 
used a Nikon with a 50-mm lens, occasionally switching to a 90-mm lens. 
<P>Late in the day my guide pointed out the interesting fact that nowhere in all 
the intricate carvings was there any use of the parallelogram. The builders of 
these ruins may have considered the parallelogram to be aesthetically unpleasing 
or religiously taboo. It is also conceivable that they simply had not discovered 
the parallelogram shape, although they made extensive use of the square and the 
rectangle. No one knows for sure. 
<P>Investigation is still going on. Clarification of this point should throw a 
great deal of light on the psychology of this ancient and mysterious people. 
<CENTER>
<H3>10</H3></CENTER>
<P>Holiday today. I went into the city and sat at one of the cafes and drank 
what passes for coffee around here and watched people pass. It was a very 
colourful spectacle. According to the brochure, this holiday is in celebration 
of an important military victory over a neighbouring country. The two countries 
now seem to be on good terms, or at least fair terms. But it is hard to be sure 
about things like that. 
<CENTER>
<H3>11</H3></CENTER>
<P>There are three important and distinct racial stocks living in this city. The 
older inhabitants look like Englishmen, the older immigrants look like 
Frenchmen, and the new immigrants look like Turks. There are various tensions 
between these groups. Regional dress, once prominent here, has died out except 
for special holidays. Everybody regrets the passing of the old customs. 
<CENTER>
<H3>12</H3></CENTER>
<P>Sometimes, in the evening, I get sad and homesick. On those nights I can't 
get to sleep I read and listen to tapes. I watch a movie on the ship's 
projector. Then I take a sleeping pill. A couple of pills, actually. I think 
it's because I'm homesick. But then I remember that I used to feel the same way 
at home. I used sleeping pills at home, too. 
<CENTER>
<H3>13</H3></CENTER>
<P>I'm afraid that this is not a very interesting planet. People tell me it's 
more interesting in the other hemisphere. But I don't think I'll go there. The 
friendship treaty is signed now and my work is done. I guess I'll be taking off. 
I'm sorry this wasn't more exotic place. But I hope to do better in my next 
exploration.
