    <p><emphasis>After the Apocalyptic War, the decimated remnants of the French huddled in the Loire Valley were gradually squeezed between two new and growing nations. The Colossus to the north was unfriendly and obviously intended to absorb the little New France. The Colossus to the south was friendly and offered to take the weak state into its confederation of republics as a full partner.</emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>A number of proud and independent French citizens feared that even the latter alternative meant the eventual transmutation of their tongue, religion, and nationality into those of their southern neighbor. Seeking a way of salvation, they built six huge spaceships that would hold thirty thousand people, most of whom would be in deep freeze until they reached their destination. The six vessels then set off into interstellar space to find a planet that would be as much like Earth as possible.</emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>That was in the 22nd Century. Over three hundred and fifty years passed before Earth heard of them again. However, we are not here concerned with the home world but with the story of a man of that pioneer group who wanted to leave the New Gaul and sail again to the stars . . .</emphasis></p>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Rastignac had no Skin. He was, nevertheless, happier than he had been since the age of five.</p>
    <p>He was as happy as a man can be who lives deep under the ground. Underground organizations are often under the ground. They are formed into cells. Cell Number One usually contains the leader of the underground.</p>
    <p>Jean-Jacques Rastignac, chief of the Legal Underground of the Kingdom of L’Bawpfey, was literally in a cell beneath the surface of the earth. He was in jail.</p>
    <p>For a dungeon, it wasn’t bad. He had two cells. One was deep inside the building proper, built into the wall so that he could sit in it when he wanted to retreat from the sun or the rain. The adjoining cell was at the bottom of a well whose top was covered with a grille of thin steel bars. Here, he spent most of his waking hours. Forced to look upwards if he wanted to see the sky or the stars, Rastignac suffered from a chronic stiff neck.</p>
    <p>Several times during the day, he had visitors. They were allowed to bend over the grille and talk down to him. A guard, one of the King’s mucketeers, stood by as a censor.</p>
    <p>When night came, Rastignac ate the meal let down by ropes on a platform. Then another of the King’s mucketeers stood by with drawn £pee until he had finished eating. When the tray was pulled back up and the grille lowered and locked, the mucketeer marched off with the turnkey.</p>
    <p>Rastignac sharpened his wit by calling a few choice insults to the night guard, then went into the cell inside the wall and lay down to take a nap. Later, he would rise and pace back and forth like a caged tiger. Now and then he would stop and look upwards, scan the stars, hunch his shoulders and resume his savage circuit of the cell. But the time would come when he would stand statue-still. Nothing moved except his head, which turned slowly.</p>
    <p>“Some day I’ll ride to the stars with you.”</p>
    <p>He said it as he watched the Six Flying Stars speed across the night sky—six glowing stars that moved in a direction opposite to the march of the other stars. Bright as Sirius seen from Earth, strung out one behind the other like jewels on a velvet string, they hurtled across the heavens.</p>
    <p>They were the six ships on which the original Loire Valley Frenchmen had sailed out into space, seeking a home on a new planet. They had been put into an orbit around New Gaul and left there while their thirty thousand passengers had descended to the surface in chemical-fuel rockets. Mankind, once on the fair and fresh earth of the new planet, had never again ascended to revisit the great ships.</p>
    <p>For three hundred years, the six ships had circled the planet known as New Gaul, nightly beacons and glowing reminders to Man that he was a stranger on this planet.</p>
    <p>When the Earthmen landed on the new planet they had called the new land <emphasis>he Beau Pays,</emphasis> or, as it was now pronounced, <emphasis>L’Bawpfey</emphasis>—The Beautiful Country. They had been delighted, entranced with the fresh new land. After the burned, war-racked Earth they had left, it was like coming to Heaven.</p>
    <p>They found two intelligent species living on the planet, and they found that the species lived in peace and that they had no conception of war or of poverty. And they were quite willing to receive the Terrans into their society.</p>
    <p>Provided, that is, they became integrated, or—as they phrased it—natural. The Frenchmen from Earth had been given their choice. They were told:</p>
    <p>“You can live with the people of the Beautiful Land on our terms or else war with us or leave to seek another planet.”</p>
    <p>The Terrans conferred. Half of them decided to stay; the other half decided to remain only long enough to mine uranium and make chemicals. Then, they would voyage onwards.</p>
    <p>But nobody from that group of Earthmen ever again stepped into the ferry-rockets and soared up to the six ion-beam ships circling about Le Beau Pays. All succumbed to the Philosophy of the Natural. Within a few generations, a stranger landing upon the planet would not have known without previous information that the Terrans were not aboriginal.</p>
    <p>He would have found three species. Two were warmblooded egglayers who had evolved directly from reptiles without becoming mammals—the Ssassarors and the Amphibs. Somewhere in their dim past—like all happy nations, they had no history—they had set up their society and been very satisfied with it since.</p>
    <p>It was a peaceful quiet world, largely peasant, where nobody had to scratch for a living and where a superb manipulation of biological forces ensured very long lives, no disease, and a social lubrication that left little to desire— from their viewpoint, anyway.</p>
    <p>The government was, nominally, a monarchy. The Kings were a different species than the group each ruled. Ssassaror ruled Human, and vice versa, each assisted by foster-brothers and sisters of the race over which they reigned. These were the so-called Dukes and Duchesses.</p>
    <p>The Chamber of Deputies—<emphasis>L’Syawp t’ Tapfuti—was</emphasis> half Human and half Ssassaror. The so-called Kings took turns presiding over the Chamber for forty day intervals. The Deputies were elected for ten-year terms by constituents who could not be deceived about their representatives’ purposes because of the sensitive Skins which allowed them to determine their true feelings and worth.</p>
    <p>In one custom alone did the ex-Terrans differ from their neighbors. This was in carrying arms. In the beginning, the Ssassaror had allowed the Men to wear their short rapiers, so they would feel safe even though in the midst of aliens.</p>
    <p>As time went on, only the King’s mucketeers—and members of the official underground—were allowed to carry spears. These men were the congenital adventurers, men who needed to swashbuckle and revel in the name of individualist.</p>
    <p>Like the egg-stealers, they needed an institution in which they could work off antisocial steam.</p>
    <p>From the beginning, the Amphibians had been a little separate from the Ssassaror, and when the Earthmen came they did not get any more neighborly. Nevertheless, they preserved excellent relations—for a long time—and they, too, participated in the Changeling-custom.</p>
    <p>This Changeling-custom was another social device set up millenia ago to keep a mutual understanding between all species on the planet. It was a peculiar institution, one that the Earthmen had found hard to understand and ever more difficult to adopt. Nevertheless, once the Skins had been accepted, they had changed their attitude, forgot their speculations about its origin, and thrown themselves into the custom of stealing babies—or eggs—from another race and raising the children as their own.</p>
    <p><emphasis>You rob my cradle; I’ll rob yours.</emphasis> Such was their motto, and it worked.</p>
    <p>A Guild of Egg Stealers was formed. The Human branch of it guaranteed, for a price, to bring you a Ssassaror child to replace the one that had been stolen from you. Or, if you lived on the seashore, and an Amphibian had crept into your nursery and taken your baby—always under two years old, according to the rules—then the Guildsman would bring you an Amphib or, perhaps, the child of a Human Changeling reared by the Seafolk.</p>
    <p>You raised it and loved it as your own. How could you help loving it? Your Skin told you that it was small and helpless and needed you and was, despite appearances, as Human as any of your babies. Nor did you need to worry about the one that had been abducted. It was getting just as good care as you were giving this one.</p>
    <p>It had never occurred to anyone to quit the stealing and voluntary exchange of babies. Perhaps, that was because it would strain even the loving nature of the Skin-wearers to give away their own flesh and blood. But, once the transfer had taken place, they could adapt.</p>
    <p>Or, perhaps, the custom was kept because tradition is stronger than law in a peasant-monarchy society and also because egg-and-baby stealing gave the more naturally aggressive and daring citizens a chance to work off antisocial behavior.</p>
    <p>Nobody but a historian would have known, and there were no historians in The Beautiful Land.</p>
    <p>Long ago, the Ssassaror had discovered that if they lived meatless, they had a much easier time curbing their belligerency, obeying the Skins and remaining cooperative. So, they induced the Earthmen to put a taboo on eating flesh. The only drawback to the meatless diet was that both Ssassaror and Man became as stunted in stature as they did in aggressiveness, the former so much so that they barely came to the chins of the Humans. These, in turn, would have seemed short to a Western European.</p>
    <p>But Rastignac, an Earthman, and his good friend, Map-farity, the Ssassaror Giant, became taboo-breakers when they were children and played together on the beach where they first ate seafood out of curiosity, then continued because they liked it. And, due to their protein diet, the Terran had grown well over six feet in height and the Ssassaror seemed to have touched off a rocket of expansion in his body. Those Ssassarors who shared his guilt—became meat-eaters—became ostracized and eventually moved off to live by themselves. They were called Ssassaror-Giants and were pointed to as an object lesson to the young of the normal Ssassarors and Humans on the land.</p>
    <p>If a stranger had landed shortly before Rastignac was born, however, he would have noticed that all was not as serene as it was supposed to be among the different species. The cause for the flaw in the former Eden might have puzzled him if he had not known the previous history of <emphasis>VBawpfey</emphasis> and the fact that the situation had not changed for the worst until the introduction of Human Changelings among the Amphibians.</p>
    <p>Then it had been that blood-drinking began among them, that Amphibians began seducing Humans to come live with them by their tales of easy immortality, and that they started the system of leaving savage little carnivores in the Human nurseries.</p>
    <p>When the Land-dwellers protested, the Amphibs replied that these things were carried out by unnaturals or outlaws, and that the Sea-King could not be held responsible. Permission was given to Chalice those caught in such behavior.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the suspicion remained that the Amphib monarch had given his unofficial official blessing and that he was preparing even more disgusting and outrageous and unnatural moves. Through his control of the populace by the Master Skin, he would be able to do as he pleased with their minds.</p>
    <p>It was the Skins that had made the universal peace possible on the planet of New Gaul. And it would be the custom of the Skins that would make possible the change from peace to conflict among the populace.</p>
    <p>Through the artificial Skins that were put on all babies at birth—and which grew with them, attached to their body, feeding from their bloodstreams, their nervous systems— the Skins, controlled by a huge Master Skin that floated in a chemical vat in the palace of the rulers, fed, indoctrinated and attended day and night by a crew of the most brilliant scientists of the planet, gave the Kings complete control of the minds and emotions of the inhabitants of the planet.</p>
    <p>Originally, the rulers of New Gaul had desired only that the populace live in peace and enjoy the good things of their planet equally. But the change that had been coming gradually—the growth of conflict between the Kings of the different species for control of the whole populace—was beginning to be generally felt. Uneasiness, distrust of each other was growing among the people. Hence the legalizing of the Underground, the Philosophy of Violence by the government, an effort to control the revolt that was brewing.</p>
    <p>Yet, the Land-dwellers had managed to take no action at all and to ignore the growing number of vicious acts.</p>
    <p>But not all were content to drowse. One man was aroused. He was Rastignac.</p>
    <p>They were Rastignac’s hope, those Six Stars, the gods to which he prayed. When they passed quickly out of his sight, he would continue his pacing, meditating for the twenty-thousandth time on a means for reaching one of those ships and using it to visit the stars. The end of his fantasies was always a curse because of the futility of such hopes. He was doomed! Mankind was doomed!</p>
    <p>And it was all the more maddening because Man would not admit that he was through. Ended, that is, as a human being.</p>
    <p>Man was changing into something not quite <emphasis>homo sapiens.</emphasis> It might be a desirable change, but it would mean the finish of his climb upwards. So it seemed to Rastignac. And he, being the man he was, had decided to do something about it even if it meant violence.</p>
    <p>That was why he was now in the well-dungeon. He was an advocator of violence against the staus quo.</p>

     <p><strong>II</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>There was another cell next to his. It was also at the bottom of a well and was separated from his by a thin wall of cement. A window had been set into it so that the prisoners could talk to each other. Rastignac did not care for the woman who had been let down into the adjoining cell, but she was somebody to talk to.</p>
    <p>“Amphib-changelings” was the name given to those human beings who had been stolen from their cradles and raised among the non-humanoid Amphibians as their own. The girl in the adjoining cell, Lusine, was such. It was not her fault that she was a blood-drinking Amphib. Yet, he could not help disliking her for what she had done and for the things she stood for.</p>
    <p>She was in prison because she had been caught in the act of stealing a Man child from its cradle. This was no legal crime, but she had left in the cradle, under the covers, a savage and blood-thirsty little monster that had leaped up and slashed the throat of the unsuspecting baby’s mother.</p>
    <p>Her cell was lit by a cageful of glowworms. Rastignac, peering through the grille, could see her shadowy shape in the inner cell inside the wall. She rose langorously and stepped into the circle of dim orange light cast by the insects. <emphasis>“B’zhu, m’fweh,”</emphasis> she greeted him.</p>
    <p>It annoyed him that she called him her brother, and it annoyed him even more to know that she knew it. It was true that she had some excuse for thus addressing him. She did resemble him. Like him, she had straight glossy blue-black hair, thick bracket-shaped eyebrows, brown eyes, a straight nose and a prominent chin. And where his build was superbly masculine, hers was magnificently feminine.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, this was not her reason for so speaking to him. She knew the disgust the Land-walker had for the Amphib-changeling, and she took a perverted delight in baiting him.</p>
    <p>He was proud that he seldom allowed her to see that she annoyed him. <emphasis>“B’zhu, jam tey zafeep,”</emphasis> he said. “Good evening, woman of the Amphibians.”</p>
    <p>Mockingly, she said, “Have you been watching the Six Flying Stars, Jean-Jacques?”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Oui.</emphasis> I do so every time they come over.”</p>
    <p>“Why do you eat your heart out because you cannot fly up to them and then voyage among the stars on one of them?”</p>
    <p>He refused to give her the satisfaction of knowing his real reason. He did not want her to realize how little he thought of Mankind and its chances for surviving—as humanity— upon the face of this planet, L’Bawpfey.</p>
    <p>“I look at them because they remind me that Man was once captain of his soul.”</p>
    <p>“Then you admit that the Land-walker is weak?”</p>
    <p>“I think he is on the way to becoming nonhuman, which is to say that he is weak, yes. But what I say about Landman goes for Seaman, too. You Changelings are becoming more Amphibian every day and less Human. Through the Skins, the Amphibs are gradually changing you. Soon you will be completely sea-people.”</p>
    <p>She laughed scornfully, exposing perfect white teeth as she did so.</p>
    <p>“The Sea will win out against the Land. It launches itself against the shore and shakes it with the crash of its body. It eats away the rock and the dirt and absorbs it into its own self. It can’t be worn away nor caught and held in a net. It is elusive and all-powerful and never-tiring.”</p>
    <p>Lusine paused for breath. He said, “That is a very pretty analogy, but it doesn’t apply. You Seafolk are as much flesh and blood as we Landfolk. What hurts us hurts you.”</p>
    <p>She put a hand around one bar. The glow-light fell upon it in such a way that it showed plainly the webbing of skin between her fingers. He glanced at it with a faint repulsion under which was a countercurrent of attraction. This was the hand that had, indirectly, shed blood.</p>
    <p>She glanced at him sidewise, challenged him in trembling tones. “You are not one to throw stones, Jean-Jacques. I have heard that you eat meat.”</p>
    <p>“Fish, not meat. That is part of my Philosophy of Violence,” he retorted. “I maintain that one of the reasons man is losing his power and strength is that he has so long been upon a vegetable diet. He is as cowed and submissive as the grass-eating beast of the fields.”</p>
    <p>Lusine put her face against the bars.</p>
    <p>“That is interesting,” she said. “But how did you happen to begin eating fish? I thought we Amphibs alone did that.” What Lusine had just said angered him. He had no reply. Rastignac knew he should not be talking to a Sea-changeling. They were glib and seductive and always searching for ways to twist your thoughts. But, being Rastignac, he had to talk. Moreover, it was so difficult to find anybody who would listen to his ideas that he could not resist the temptation.</p>
    <p>“I was given fish by the Ssassaror, Mapfarity, when I was a child. We lived along the seashore. Mapfarity was a child, too, and we played together. ‘Don’t eat fish!’ my parents said. To me that meant ‘Eat it!’ So, despite my distaste at the idea, and my squeamish stomach, I did eat fish. And I liked it. And, as I grew to manhood, I adopted the Philosophy of Violence and I continued to eat fish although I am not a Changeling.”</p>
    <p>“What did your Skin do when it detected you?” Lusine asked. Her eyes were wide and luminous with wonder and a sort of glee as if she relished the confession of his sins. Also, he knew, she was taunting him about the futility of his ideas of violence so long as he was a prisoner of the Skin.</p>
    <p>He frowned in annoyance at the reminder of the Skin. Much thought had he given, in a weak way, to the possibility of life without the Skin.</p>
    <p>Ashamed now of his weak resistance to the Skin, he blustered a bit in front of the teasing Amphib girl.</p>
    <p>“Mapfarity and I discovered something that most people don’t know,” he answered boastfully. “We found that if you can stand the shocks your Skin gives you when you do something wrong, the Skin gets tired and quits after a while. Of course, your Skin recharges itself and the next time you eat fish it shocks you again. But, after very many shocks, it becomes accustomed, forgets its conditioning, and leaves you alone.”</p>
    <p>Lusine laughed and said in a low conspirational tone, “So your Ssassaror pal and you adopted the Philosophy of Violence because you remained fish and meat eaters?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, we did. When Mapfarity reached puberty he became a Giant and went off to live in a castle in the forest. But we have remained friends through our connection in the underground.”</p>
    <p>“Your parents must have suspected that you were a fish eater when you first proposed your Philosophy of Violence?” she said.</p>
    <p>“Suspicion isn’t proof,” he answered. “But I shouldn’t be telling you all this, Lusine. I feel it is safe for me to do so only because you will never have a chance to tell on me. You will soon be taken to Chalice and there you will stay until you have been cured.”</p>
    <p>She shivered and said, “This Chalice? What is it?”</p>
    <p>“It is a place far to the north where both Terrans and Ssassarors send their incorrigibles. It is an extinct volcano whose steep-sided interior makes an inescapable prison. There those who have persisted in unnatural behavior are given special treatment.”</p>
    <p>“They are bled?” she asked, her eyes widening as her tongue flicked over her lips again hungrily.</p>
    <p>“No. A special breed of Skin is given them to wear. These Skins shock them more powerfully than the ordinary ones, and the shocks are associated with the habit they are trying to cure. The shocks effect a cure. Also, these special Skins are used to detect hidden unnatural emotions. They recondition the deviate. The result is that when the Chaliced Man is judged able to go out and take his place in society again, he is thoroughly reconditioned. Then, his regular Skin is given back to him, and it has no trouble keeping him in line from then on. The Chaliced Man is a very good citizen.”</p>
    <p>“And what if a revolter doesn't become Chaliced?”</p>
    <p>“Then, he stays in Chalice until he decides to become so.” Her voice rose sharply as she said, “But if I go there, and I am not fed the diet of the Amphibs, I will grow old and die!”</p>
    <p>“No. The government will feed you the diet you need until you are reconditioned. Except . . He paused.</p>
    <p>“Except I won’t get blood,” she wailed. Then, realizing she was acting undignified before a Landman, she firmed her voice.</p>
    <p>“The King of the Amphibians will not allow them to do this to me,” she said. “When he hears of it, he will demand my return. And, if the King of Men refuses, my King will use violence to get me back.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac smiled and said, “I hope he does. Then, perhaps, my people will wake up and get rid of their Skins and make war upon your people.”</p>
    <p>“So that is what you Philosophers of Violence want, is it? Well, you will not get it. My father, the Amphib King, will not be so stupid as to declare a war.”</p>
    <p>“I suppose not,” replied Rastignac. “He will send a band to rescue you. If they’re caught, they’ll claim to be criminals and say they are <emphasis>not</emphasis> under the King’s orders.”</p>
    <p>Lusine looked upwards to see if a guard was hanging over the well’s mouth listening. Perceiving no one, she nodded and said, “You have guessed it correctly. And that is why we laugh so much at you stupid Humans. You know as well as we do what’s going on, but you are afraid to tell us so. You keep clinging to the idea that your tum-the-other-cheek policy will soften us and insure peace.”</p>
    <p>“Not I,” said Rastignac. “I know perfectly well there is only one solution to man’s problems. That is—”</p>
    <p>“That is Violence,” she finished for him. “That is what you have been preaching. And that is why you are in this cell, waiting for trial.”</p>
    <p>“You don’t understand,” he said. “Men are not put into the Chalice for <emphasis>proposing</emphasis> new philosophies. As long as they behave naturally, they may say what they wish. They may even petition the King that the new philosophy be made a law. The King passes it on to the Chamber of Deputies. They consider it and put it up to the people. If the people like it, it becomes a law. The only trouble with that procedure is that it may take ten years before the law is considered by the Chamber of Deputies.”</p>
    <p>“And in those ten years,” she mocked, “the Amphibs and the Amphibian-changelings will have won the planet.” “That is true,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The King of the Humans is a Ssassaror and the King of the Ssassaror is a Man,” said Lusine. “Our King can’t see any reason for changing the status quo. After all, it. is the Ssassaror who are responsible for the Skins and for Man’s position in the sentient society of this planet. Why should he be favorable to a policy of Violence? The Ssassarors loathe violence.</p>
    <p>“And so you have preached Violence without waiting for it to become a law? And for that you are now in this cell?” “Not exactly. The Ssassarors have long known that to suppress too much of Man’s naturally belligerent nature only results in an explosion. So they have legalized illegality— up to a point. Thus, the King socially made me the Chief of the Underground and gave me a state license to preach— but not practice—Violence. I am even allowed to advocate overthrow of the present system of government—as long as I take no action that is too productive of results.</p>
    <p>“I am in jail now because the Minister of Ill-Will put me here. He had my Skin examined, and it was found to be ‘unhealthy.’ He thought I’d be better off locked up until I became ‘healthy’ again. But the King . .</p>

     <p><strong>III</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>Lusine’s laughter was like the call of a silverbell bird. Whatever her unhuman appetites, she had a beautiful voice. She said, “How comical! And how do you, with your brave ideas, like being regarded as a harmless figure of fun, or as a sick man?”</p>
    <p>“I like it as well as you would,” he growled.</p>
    <p>She gripped the bars of her window until the tendons on the back of her long thin hands stood out and the membranes between her fingers stretched like windblown tents. Face twisted, she spat at him, “Coward! Why don’t you kill somebody and break out of this ridiculous mold—that Skin that the Ssassarors have poured you into?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac was silent. That was a good question. Why didn’t he? Killing was the logical result of his philosophy. But the Skin kept him docile. Yes, he could vaguely see that he had purposely shut his eyes to the destination towards which his ideas were slowly but inevitably traveling.</p>
    <p>And there was another facet to the answer to her question—if he had to kill, he would not kill a Man. His philosophy was directed towards the Amphibians and the Sea-changelings.</p>
    <p>He said, “Violence doesn’t necessarily mean the shedding of blood, Lusine. My philosophy urges that we take a more vigorous action, that we overthrow some of the biosocial institutions which have imprisoned Man and stripped him of his dignity as an indvidual.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, I have heard that you want Man to stop wearing the Skin. That is what has horrified your people, isn't it?” “Yes,” he said. “And I understand it has had the same effect among the Amphibians.”</p>
    <p>She bridled, her brown eyes flashing in the feeble glowworms' light. “Why shouldn’t it? What would we be without our Skins?”</p>
    <p>“What, indeed?” he said, laughing derisively afterwards. Earnestly, she said, “You don’t understand. We Amphibians—our Skins are not like yours. We do not wear them for the same reason you do. You are imprisoned by your Skins—they tell you how to feel, what to think. Above all, they keep you from getting ideas about noncooperation or nonintegration with Nature as a whole.</p>
    <p>“That, to us individualistic Amphibians, is false. The purpose of our Skins is to make sure that our King’s subjects understand what he wants so that we may all act as one unit and thus further the progress of the Seafolk.”</p>
    <p>The first time Rastignac had heard this statement, he had howled with laugher. Now, however, knowing that she could not see the fallacy, he did not try to argue the point. The Amphibs were, in their way, as hidebound—no pun intended—as the Land-walkers.</p>
    <p>“Look, Lusine,” he said, “there are only three places where a Man may take off his Skin. One is in his own home, when he may hang it upon the halltree. Two is when he is, like us, in jail and therefore may not harm anybody. The third is when a man is King. Now, you and I have been without our Skins for a week. We have gone longer without them I han anybody, except the King. Tell me true, don’t you feel free for the first time in your life?</p>
    <p>“Don’t you feel as if you belong to nobody but yourself, (hat you are accountable to no one but yourself, and that you love that feeling? And don’t you dread the day we will be let out of prison and made to wear our Skins again? That day which, curiously enough, will be the very day that we will lose our freedom.”</p>
    <p>Lusine looked as if she didn’t know what he was talking about.</p>
    <p>“You’ll see what I mean when we are freed and the Skins are put back upon us,” he said. Immediately after, he was embarrassed. He remembered that she would go to the Chalice where one of the heavy and powerful Skins used for unnaturals would be fastened to her shoulders.</p>
    <p>Lusine did not notice. She was considering the last but most telling point in her argument. “You cannot win against us,” she said, watching him narrowly for the effect of her words. “We have a weapon that is irresistible. We have immortality.”</p>
    <p>His face did not lose its imperturbability.</p>
    <p>She continued, “And what is more, we can give immortality to anyone who casts off his Skin and adopts ours. Don’t think that your people don’t know this. For instance, during the last year more than two thousand Humans living along the beaches deserted and went over to us, the Am-phibs.”</p>
    <p>He was a little shocked to hear this, but he did not doubt her. He remembered the mysterious case of the schooner <emphasis>he Pauvre Pierre</emphasis> which had been found drifting and crew-less, and he remembered a conversation he had had with a fisherman in his home port of Marrec.</p>
    <p>He put his hands behind his back and began pacing. Lusine continued staring at him through the bars. Despite the fact that her face was in the shadows, he could see—or feel—her smile. He had humiliated her, but she had won in the end.</p>
    <p>Rastignac quit his limited roving and called up to the guard.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Shoo Vfootyay, kal u ay teeP"</emphasis></p>
    <p>The guard leaned over the grille. His large hat with its tall wings sticking from the peak was green in the daytime. But now, illuminated only by a far off torchlight and by a glowworm coiled around the band, it was black.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Ah, shoo Zhaw-Zhawk W’stenyek,”</emphasis> he said, loudly. “What time is it? What do you care what time it is?” And he concluded with the stock phrase of the jailer, unchanged through mil-lenia and over light-years. “You’re not going any place, are you?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac threw his head back to howl at the guard but stopped to wince at the sudden pain in his neck. After uttering, <emphasis>“Sek Ploo!”</emphasis> and <emphasis>“S’pweestee!”</emphasis> both of which were close enough to the old Terran French so that a language specialist might have recognized them, he said, more calmly, “If you would let me out on the ground, <emphasis>monsier le foutriquet,</emphasis> and give me a good 6p6e. I would show you where I am going. Or, at least, where my sword is going. I am thinking of a nice sheath for it.”</p>
    <p>Tonight, he had a special reason for keeping the attention of the King’s mucketeer directed towards himself. So, when the guard grew tired of returning insults—mainly because his limited imagination could invent no new ones—Rastignac began telling jokes aimed at the mucketeer’s narrow intellect.</p>
    <p>“Then,” said Rastignac, “there was the itinerant salesman whose <emphasis>s’fel</emphasis> threw a shoe. He knocked on the door of the hut of the nearest peasant and said . . What was said by the salesman was never known.</p>
    <p>A strangled gasp had come from above.</p>

     <p><strong>IV</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>Rastignac saw something enormous blot out the smaller shadow of the guard. Then, both figures disappeared. A moment later, a silhouette cut across the lines of the grille. Unoiled hinges screeched; the bars lifted. A rope uncoiled from above to fall at Rastignac’s feet. He seized it and felt himself being drawn powerfully upwards.</p>
    <p>When he came over the edge of the well, he saw that his rescuer was a giant Ssassaror. The light from the glowworm on the guard’s hat lit up feebly his face, which was orthagnathous and had quite humanoid eyes and lips. Large canine teeth stuck out from the mouth, and its huge ears were tipped with feathery tufts. The forehead down to the eyebrows looked as if it needed a shave, but Rastignac knew that more light would show the blue-black shade came from many small feathers, not stubbled hair.</p>
    <p>“Mapfarity!” Rastignac said. “It’s good to see you after all these years!”</p>
    <p>The Ssassaror giant put his hand on his friend’s shoulder. Clenched, it was almost as big as Rastignac’s head. He spoke with a voice like a lion coughing at the bottom of a deep well.</p>
    <p>“It is good to see you again, my friend.”</p>
    <p>“What are you doing here?” said Rastignac, tears running down his face as he stroked the great fingers on his shoulder.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity’s huge ears quivered like the wings of a bat tied to a rock and unable to fly off. The tufts of feathers at their ends grew stiff and suddenly crackled with tiny sparks.</p>
    <p>The electrical display was his equivalent of the human’s weeping. Both creatures discharged emotion; their bodies chose different avenues and manifestations. Nevertheless, the sight of the other’s joy affected each deeply.</p>
    <p>“I have come to rescue you,” said Mapfarity. “I caught Archambaud here,”—he indicated the other man—"stealing eggs from my golden goose. And . .</p>
    <p>Raoul Archambaud—pronounced Wawl Shebvo—interrupted excitedly, “I showed him my license to steal eggs from Giants who were raising counterfeit geese, but he was going to lock me up anyway. He was going to take my Skin off and feed me on meat . .</p>
    <p>“Meat!” said Rastignac, astonished and revolted despite himself. “Mapfarity, what have you been doing in that castle of yours?”</p>
    <p>Mapfarity lowered his voice to match the distant roar of a cataract. “I haven’t been very active these last few years,” he said, “because I am so big that it hurts my feet if I walk very much. So I’ve had much time to think. And I, being logical, decided that the next step after eating fish was eating meat. It couldn’t make me any larger. So, I ate meat. And while doing so, I came to the same conclusion that you, apparently, have done independently. That is, the Philosophy of . .</p>
    <p>“Of Violence,” interrupted Archambaud. “Ah, Jean-Jacques, there must be some mystic bond that brings two Humans of such different backgrounds as yours and the Ssassaror together, giving you both the same philosophy. When I explained what you had been doing and that you were in jail because you had advocated getting rid of the Skins, Mapfarity petitioned . .</p>
    <p>“The King to make an official jail-break,” said Mapfarity with an impatient glance at the rolypoly egg-stealer. “And ...”</p>
    <p>“The King agreed,” broke in Archambaud, “provided Mapfarity would turn in his counterfeit goose and provided you would agree to say no more about abandoning Skins, but . . .”</p>
    <p>The Giant’s basso profundo-redundo pushed the egg-stealer’s high pitch aside. “If this squeaker will quit interrupting, perhaps we can get on with the rescue. We’ll talk later, if you don’t mind.”</p>
    <p>At that moment, Lusine’s voice floated up from the bottom of her cell. “Jean-Jacques, my love, my brave, my own, would you abandon me to the Chalice? Please take me with you! You will need somebody to hide you when the Minister of Ill-Will sends his mucketeers after you. I can hide you where no one will ever find you.” Her voice was mocking, but there was an undercurrent of anxiety to it.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity muttered, “She will hide us, yes, at the bottom of a sea-cave where we will eat strange food and suffer a change. Never . . .”</p>
    <p>“Trust an Amphib,” finished Archambaud for him.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity forgot to whisper. “<emphasis>Bey-t’cul</emphasis>, <emphasis>vu nu fez vey! Fe’m sa!”</emphasis> he roared.</p>
    <p>A shocked hush covered the courtyard. Only Mapfarity’s wrathful breathing could be heard. Then, disembodied, Lu-sine’s voice floated from the well.</p>
    <p>“Jean-Jacques, do not forget that I am the foster-daughter of the King of the Amphibians! If you were to take me with you, I could assure you of safety and a warm welcome in the halls of the Sea-King’s Palacel”</p>
    <p>“Pah!” said Mapfarity. “That web-footed witch!”</p>
    <p>Rastignac did not reply to her. He took the broad silk belt and the sheathed epee from Archambaud and buckled them around his waist. Mapfarity handed him a mucketeer’s hat; he clapped that on firmly. Last of all, he took the Skin that the fat egg-stealer had been holding out to him.</p>
    <p>For the first time, he hesitated. It was his Skin, the one he had been wearing since he was six. It had grown with him, fed off his blood for twenty-two years, clung to him as clothing, censor, and castigator, and parted from him only when he was inside the walls of his own house, went swimming, or, as during the last seven days, when he lay in jail.</p>
    <p>A week ago, after they had removed his second Skin, he had felt naked and helpless and cut off from his fellow creatures. But that was a week ago. Since then, as he had remarked to Lusine, he had experienced the birth of a strange feeling. It was, at first, frightening. It made him cling to the bars as if they were the only stable thing in the center of a whirling universe.</p>
    <p>Later, when that first giddiness had passed, it was succeeded by another intoxication—the joy of being an individual, the knowledge that he was separate, not a part of a multitude. Without the Skin, he could think as he pleased. He did not have a censor.</p>
    <p>Now, he was on level ground again, out of the cell. But as soon as he had put that prison-shaft behind him, he was faced with the old second Skin.</p>
    <p>Archambaud held it out like a cloak in his hands. It looked much like a ragged garment. It was pale and limp and roughly rectangular with four extensions at each comer. When Rastignac put it on his back, it would sink four tiny hollow teeth into his veins and the suckers on the inner surface of its flat body would cling to him. Its long upper extensions would wrap themselves around his shoulders and over his chest; the lower, around his loins and thighs. Soon it would lose its paleness and flaccidity, become pink and slightly convex, pulsing with Rastignac’s blood.</p>
   </section>

     <p><strong>V</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>Rastignac hesitated for a few seconds. Then, he allowed l he habit of a lifetime to take over. Sighing, he turned his back. In a moment, he felt the cold flesh descend over his shoulders and the little bite of the four teeth as they attached the Skin to his shoulders. Then, as his blood poured into the creature he felt it grow warm and strong. It spread out and followed the passages it had long ago been conditioned to follow, wrapped him warmly and lovingly and comfortably. And he knew, though he couldn’t feel it, that it was pushing nerves into the grooves along the teeth. Nerves to connect with his.</p>
    <p>A minute later, he experienced the first of the expected <emphasis>rapport.</emphasis> It was nothing that you could put a mental finger on. It was just a diffused tingling and then the sudden consciousness of how the others around him <emphasis>felt.</emphasis></p>
    <p>They were ghosts in the background of his mind. Yet, pale and ectoplasmic as they were, they were easily identifiable. Mapfarity loomed above the others, a transparent Colossus radiating streamers of confidence in his clumsy strength. A meat-eater, uncertain about the future, with a hope and trust in Rastignac to show him the right way. And with a strong current of anger against the conqueror who had inflicted the Skin upon him.</p>
    <p>Archambaud was a shorter phantom, rolypoly even in his psychic manifestations, emitting bursts of impatience because other people did not talk fast enough to suit him, his mind leaping on ahead of their tongues, his fingers wriggling to wrap themselves around something valuable—preferably the eggs of the golden goose—and a general eagerness to be up and about and onwards. He was one round fidget on two legs yet a good man for any project requiring action.</p>
    <p>Faintly, Rastignac detected the slumbering guard as if he were the tendrils of some plant at the sea-bottom, floating in the green twilight, at peace and unconscious.</p>
    <p>And, even more faintly, he felt Lusine’s presence, shielded by the walls of the shaft. Hers was a pale and light hand, one whose fingers tapped a barely heard code of impotent rage and voiceless screaming fear. But beneath that anguish was a base of confidence and mockery at others. She might be temporarily upset, but when the chance came for her to do something, she would seize it with every ability at her command.</p>
    <p>Another radiation dipped into the general picture and out. A wild glowworm had swooped over them and disturbed the smooth reflection built up by the Skins.</p>
    <p>This was the way the Skins worked. They penetrated into you and found out what you were feeling and emoting, and then they broadcast it to other closeby Skins, which then projected their hosts’ psychosomatic responses. The whole was then integrated so that each Skin-wearer could detect the group-feeling and at the same time, though in a much duller manner, the feeling of the individuals of the <emphasis>gestalt.</emphasis></p>
    <p>That wasn’t the only function of the Skin. The parasite, created in the bio-factories, had several other social and biological uses.</p>
    <p>Rastignac almost fell into a reverie at that point. It was nothing unusual. The effect of the Skins was a slowing-down one. The wearer thought more slowly, acted more leisurely, and was much more contented.</p>
    <p>But now, by a deliberate wrenching of himself from the feeling-pattem, Rastignac woke up. There were things to do, and standing around and eating the lotus of the group-rapport was not one of them.</p>
    <p>He gestured at the prostrate form of the mucketeer. “You didn’t hurt him?”</p>
    <p>The Ssassaror rumbled, “No. I scratched him with a little venom of the dream-snake. He will sleep for an hour or so. Besides, I would not be allowed to hurt him. You forget that all this is carefully staged by the King’s Official Jail-breaker.” “<emphasis>Me’dt!”</emphasis> swore Rastignac.</p>
    <p>Alarmed, Archambaud said, "What’s the matter, Jean-Jacques?”</p>
    <p>“Can’t we do anything on our own? Must the King meddle in everything?”</p>
    <p>“You wouldn’t want us to take a chance and have to shed blood, would you?” breathed Archambaud.</p>
    <p>“What are you carrying those swords for? As a decoration?” Rastignac snarled.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Seelahs, mfweh,”</emphasis> warned Mapfarity. “If you alarm the other guards, you will embarrass them. They will be forced to do their duty and recapture you. And the Jail-breaker would be reprimanded because he had fallen down on his job. He might even get a demotion.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac was so upset that his Skin, reacting to the negative fields racing over the Skin and the hormone imbalance of his blood, writhed away from his back.</p>
    <p>“What are we, a bunch of children playing war?”</p>
    <p>Mapfarity growled, “We are all God’s children, and we mustn’t hurt anyone if we can help it.”</p>
    <p>“Mapfarity, you eat meat!”</p>
    <p><emphasis>"Voo zavf w’zaw mfweh”</emphasis> admitted the Giant. "But it is the flesh of unintelligent creatures. I have not yet shed the blood of any being that can talk with the tongue of Man."</p>
    <p>Rastignac snorted and said, “If you stick with me you will some day do that, <emphasis>m’ftveh</emphasis> Mapfarity. There is no other course. It is inevitable.”</p>
    <p>“Nature spare me the day! But if it comes it will find Mapfarity unafraid. They do not call me Giant for nothing.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac sighed and walked ahead. Sometimes he wondered if the members of his underground—or anybody else for that matter—ever realized the grim conclusions formed by the Philosophy of Violence.</p>
    <p>The Amphibians, he was sure, did. And they were doing something positive about it. But it was the Amphibians who had driven Rastignac to adopt a Philosophy of Violence.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Law,”</emphasis> he said again, “Let’s go.”</p>
    <p>The three of them walked out of the huge courtyard and through the open gate. Nearby stood a short man whose Skin gleamed black-red in the light shed by the two glowworms attached to his shoulders. The Skin was oversized and hung to the ground.</p>
    <p>The King’s man, however, did not think he was a comic figure. He sputtered, and the red of his face matched the color of the skin on his back.</p>
    <p>“You took long enough,” he said accusingly, and then, when Rastignac opened his mouth to protest, the Jail-breaker said, “Never mind, never mind. <emphasis>Sa napawt.</emphasis> The thing is that we get you away fast. The Minister of Ill-Will has doubtless by now received word that an official jail-break is planned for tonight. He will send a company of his mucketeers to inercept you. By coming in advance of the appointed time we shall have time to escape before the official rescue party arrives.”</p>
    <p>“How much time do we have?” asked Rastignac.</p>
    <p>The King’s man said, “Let’s see. After I escort you through the rooms of the Duke, the King’s foster-brother—he is most favorable to the Violent Philosophy, you know, and has petitioned the King to become your official patron, which petition will be considered at the next meeting of the Chamber of Deputies in three months—let’s see, where was I? Ah, yes, I escort you through the rooms of the King's brother. You will be disguised as His Majesty’s mucketeers, ostensibly looking for the escaped prisoners. From the rooms of the Duke, you will be let out through a small door in the wall of the palace itself. A car will be waiting.</p>
    <p>“From then on it will be up to you. I suggest, however, that you make a dash for Mapfarity’s castle. Follow the <emphasis>Rue des Nues;</emphasis> that is your best chance. The mucketeers have been pulled off that boulevard. However, it is possible that Auverpin, the Ill-Will Minister, may see that order and will rescind it, realizing what it means. If he does, I suppose I will see you back in your cell, Rastignac.”</p>
    <p>He bowed to the Ssassaror and Archambaud and said, “And you two gentlemen will then be with him.”</p>
    <p>“And then what?” rumbled Mapfarity.</p>
    <p>“According to the law, you will be allowed one more jail-break. Any more after that will, of course, be illegal. That is, unthinkable.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac unsheathed his 6p6e and slashed it at the air. "Let the mucketeers stand in my way,” he said fiercely. "I will cut them down with this!”</p>
    <p>The Jail-breaker staggered back, hands outthrust.</p>
    <p>“Please, Monsieur Rastignac! Please! Don’t even talk about it! You know that your philosophy is, as yet, illegal. The shedding of blood is an act that will be regarded with horror throughout the sentient planet. People would think you are an Amphibian!”</p>
    <p>“The Amphibians know what they’re doing far better than we do,” answered Rastignac. “Why do you think they’re winning against us Humans?”</p>
    <p>Suddenly, before anybody could answer, the sound of blaring horns came from somewhere on the ramparts. Shouts went up; drums began to beat, calling the mucketeers to alert.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“M’plew!”</emphasis> said the Jail-breaker. “The Minister of Ill-Will has warned the guards! Or something else, equally disastrous, has happened!”</p>
    <p>Lusine’s voice, shrill but powerful, soared out of the well. “Jean-Jacques, will you take me with you? You must!”</p>
    <p>“Nol” shouted Rastignac. “Neverl Nothing would make me help a bloodsucker!"</p>
    <p>“Ah, Jean-Jacques, but you do not know what I know. Something I would never have told you if I did not have to tell in order to get free!”</p>
    <p>“Shut up, Lusine! You cannot influence me!”</p>
    <p>“But I can. I have a secret! A secret that will enable you to escape from this planet, to fly to the stars!”</p>
    <p>Rastignac almost dropped his sword. But, before he could run to the lip of the well, Mapfarity had leaned his huge head over the mouth and rumbled something to the prisoner below.</p>
    <p>Rastignac could not hear what Lusine answered, but he did not have to. The giant Ssassaror straightened up, and lie bellowed, “She says that an Earthship has landed in the sea! And the pilot of the ship is in the hands of the Amphibians!”</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, Mapfarity began laughing. Finally, chokjng, the sparks crackling from the tips of his ears, he said, “You can leave her in the well. Her news is no news; I know her so-called secret. But I didn’t say anything to you because I didn’t think that now was the time.”</p>
    <p>As the meaning of the words seeped into Rastignac’s consciousness, he made a sudden violent movement—and began to tear the Skin from his body!</p>
   </section>

    <title>
     <p>VI</p>
    </title>
    <p>Rastignac ran down the steps, out into the courtyard. He seized the Jail-breaker’s arm and demanded the key to the grilles. Dazed, the white-faced official meekly and silently handed it to him. Without his Skin, Rastignac was no longer fearfully inhibited. If you were forceful enough and did not behave according to the normal pattern, you could get just about anything you wanted. The average Man or Ssassaror did not know how to react to his violence. By the time they had recovered from their confusion, he could be miles away.</p>
    <p>Such a thought flashed through his head as he ran towards the prison wells. At the same time he heard the hom-blasts of the king’s mucketeers and knew that he shortly would have a different type of Man to deal with. The mucketeers, closest approach to soldiers in this pacifistic land, wore Skins that conditioned them to be more belligerent than the common citizen. They carried ep6es and, while it was true that their points were dull and their wielders had never engaged in serious swordsmanship, the mucketeers could be dangerous because of numbers alone.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity bellowed, “Jean-Jacques, what are you doing?”</p>
    <p>He called back over his shoulder, “I’m taking Lusine with us! She can help us get the Earthman from the Amphibians!”</p>
    <p>The Giant lumbered up behind him, threw a rope down to the eager hands of Lusine, and pulled her up without effort to the top of the well. A second later, Rastignac leaped upon Mapfarity’s back, dug his hands under the upper fringe of the huge Skin and, ignoring its electrical blasts, ripped downwards.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity cried out with shock and surprise as his skin flopped on the stones like a devilfish on dry land.</p>
    <p>Archambaud ran up then and, without bothering to explain, the Ssassaror and the Man seized him and peeled off <emphasis>his</emphasis> artificial hide.</p>
    <p>“Now we’re all free men!” panted Rastignac. “And the mucketeers have no way of locating us if we hide, nor can they punish us with shocks.”</p>
    <p>He put the Giant on his right side, Lusine on his left, and the egg-stealer behind him. He removed the Jail-breaker’s rapier from his sheath. The official was too astonished to protest.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Law, m’zawfa!”</emphasis> cried Rastignac, parodying in his grotesque French the old Gallic war cry of “<emphasis>Allons, mes enfants!”</emphasis></p>
    <p>The King’s official came to life and screamed orders at the group of mucketeers who had poured into the courtyard. They halted in confusion. They could not hear him above the roar of horns and thunder of drums and the people sticking their heads out of windows and shouting.</p>
    <p>Rastignac scooped up with his 6p6e one of the abaondoned Skins flopping on the floor and threw it at the foremost guard. It descended upon the man’s head, knocking off his hat and wrapping itself around the head and shoulders. The guard dropped his sword and staggered backwards into the group. At the same time, the escapees charged and bowled over their feeble opposition.</p>
    <p>It was here that Rastignac drew first blood. The tip of his £pee drove past a bewildered mucketeer’s blade and entered the fellow’s throat just below the chin. It did not penetrate very far because of the dullness of the point. Nevertheless, when Rastignac withdrew his sword, he saw blood spurt.</p>
    <p>It was the first flower of violence, this scarlet blossom set against the whiteness of a Man’s skin.</p>
    <p>It would, if he had worn his Skin, have sickened him. Now, he exulted with a shout of triumph.</p>
    <p>Lusine swooped up from behind him, bent over the fallen man. Her fingers dipped into the blood and went to her mouth. Greedily, she sucked her fingers.</p>
    <p>Rastignac struck her cheek hard with the flat of his hand. She staggered back, her eyes narrow, but she laughed.</p>
    <p>The next moments were busy as they entered the castle, knocked down two mucketeers who tried to prevent their passage to the Duke’s rooms, then filed across the long suite.</p>
    <p>The Duke rose from his writing-desk to greet them. Rastignac, determined to sever all ties and impress the government with the fact that he meant a real violence, snarled at his benefactor, <emphasis>“Va t’feh fout!”</emphasis></p>
    <p>The Duke was disconcerted at this harsh command, so obviously impossible to carry out. He blinked and said nothing. The escapees hurried past him to the door that gave exit to the outside. They pushed it open and stepped out into the car that waited for them. A chauffeur leaned against its thin wooden body.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity pushed him aside and climbed in. The others followed. Rastignac was the last to get in. He examined in a glance the vehicle they were supposed to make their flight in.</p>
    <p>It was as good a car as you could find in the realm. A Renault of the large class, it had a long boat-shaped scarlet body. There wasn’t a scratch on it. It had seats for six. And that it had the power to outrun most anything was indicated by the two extra pairs of legs sticking out from the bottom. There were twelve pairs of legs, equine in form and shod with the best steel. It was the kind of vehicle you wanted when you might have to take off across the country. Wheeled cars could go faster on the highway, but this Renault would not be daunted by water, plowed fields, or steep hillsides.</p>
    <p>Rastignac climbed into the driver’s seat, seized the wheel, and pressed his foot down on the accelerator. The nerve-spot beneath the pedal sent a message to the muscles hidden beneath the hood and the legs projecting from the body. The Renault lurched forward, steadied, and began to pick up speed. It entered a broad paved highway. Hooves drummed; sparks shot out from the steel shoes.</p>
    <p>Rastignac guided the brainless, blind creature concealed within the body. He was helped by the somatically-generated radar it employed to steer it past obstacles. When he came to the <emphasis>Rue des Nues,</emphasis> he slowed it down to a trot. There was no use tiring it out. Halfway up the gentle slope of the boulevard, however, a Ford galloped out from a side-street. Its seats bristled with tall peaked hats with outspread glowworm wings and with drawn 6pees.</p>
    <p>Rastignac shoved the accelerator to the floor. The Renault broke into a gallop. The Ford turned so that it would present its broad side. As there was a fencework of tall shubbery growing along the boulevard, the Ford was thus able to block most of the passage.</p>
    <p>But, just before his vehicle reached the Ford, Rastignac pressed the Jump button. Few cars had this; only sportsmen or the royalty could afford to have such a neural circuit installed. And it did not allow for gradations in leaping. It was an all-or-none reaction; the legs spurned the ground in perfect unison and with every bit of the power in them. There was no holding back.</p>
    <p>The nose lifted, the Renault soared into the air. There was a shout, a slight swaying as the trailing hooves struck the heads of mucketeers who had been stupid enough not to duck, and the vehicle landed with a screeching lurch, upright, on the other side of the Ford. Nor did it pause.</p>
    <p>Half an hour later Rastignac reined in the car under a large tree whose shadow protected them. “We’re well out in the country,” he said.</p>
    <p>"What do we do now?” asked impatient Archambaud.</p>
    <p>“First we must know more about this Earthman,” Rastignac answered. “Then we can decide.”</p>

    </title>
    <p>Dawn broke through night’s guard and spilled a crimson swath on the hills to the East, and the Six Flying Stars faded from sight like a necklace of glowing jewels dipped into an ink bottle.</p>
    <p>Rastignac halted the weary Renault on the top of a hill, looked down over the landscape spread out for miles below him. Mapfarity’s castle—a tall rose-colored tower of flying buttresses—flashed in the rising sun. It stood on another hill by the sea shore. The country around was a madman’s dream of color. Yet to Rastignac every hue sickened the eye. That bright green, for instance, was poisonous; that flaming scarlet was bloody; that pale yellow, rheumy; that velvet black, funeral; that pure white, maggotty.</p>
    <p>“Rastignac!” It was Mapfarity’s bass, strumming irritation deep in his chest.</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“What do we do now?”</p>
    <p>Jean-Jacques was silent. Archambaud spoke plaintively.</p>
    <p>“I’m not used to going without my Skin. There are things I miss. For one thing, I don’t know what you’re thinking, Jean-Jacques. I don’t know whether you’re angry at me or love me or are indifferent to me. I don’t know where other people <emphasis>are.</emphasis> I don’t feel the joy of the little animals playing, the freedom of the flight of birds, the ghostly plucking of the growing grass, the sweet stab of the mating lust of the wild-homed apigator, the humming of bees working to build a hive, and the sleepy stupid arrogance of the giant cabbage-eating <emphasis>duexnez.</emphasis> I can feel nothing without the Skin I have worn so long. I feel alone.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac replied, “You are not alone. I am with you.”</p>
    <p>Lusine spoke in a low voice, her large brown eyes upon his.</p>
    <p>“I, too, feel alone. My Skin is gone, the Skin by which I knew how to act according to the wisdom of my father, the Amphib King. Now that it is gone and I cannot hear his voice through the vibrating tympanum, I do not know what to do.”</p>
    <p>“At present,” replied Rastignac, “you will do as I tell you.” Mapfarity repeated, “What now?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac became brisk. He said, “We go to your castle, Giant. We use your smithy to put sharp points on our swords, points to slide through a man’s body from front to back. Don’t palel That is what we must do. And then we pick up your goose that lays the golden eggs, for we must have money if we are to act efficiently. After that, we buy—or steal—a boat and we go to wherever the Earthman is held captive. And we rescue him.”</p>
    <p>“And then?” said Lusine, her eyes shining.</p>
    <p>“What you do then will be up to you. But I am going to leave this planet and voyage with the Earthman to other worlds.”</p>
    <p>Silence. Then Mapfarity said, “Why leave here?”</p>
    <p>“Because there is no hope for this land. Nobody will give up his Skin. <emphasis>Le Beau Pays is</emphasis> doomed to a lotus-life. And that is not for me.”</p>
    <p>Archambaud jerked a thumb at the Amphib girl. “What about her people?”</p>
    <p>“They may win, the water-people. What’s the difference? It will be just the exchange of one Skin for another. Before I heard of the landing of the Earthman I was going to fight no matter what the cost to me or inevitable defeat. But not now.”</p>
    <p>Mapfarity’s rumble was angry. “Ah, Jean-Jacques, this is not my comrade talking. Are you sure you haven’t swallowed your Skin? You talk as if you were inside-out. What is the matter with your brain? Can’t you see that it will indeed make a difference if the Amphibs get the upper hand? Can’t you see <emphasis>who</emphasis> is making the Amphibs behave the way they have been?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac urged the Renault towards the rose-colored lacy castle high upon a hill. The vehicle trotted tiredly along the rough and narrow forest path.</p>
    <p>“What do you mean?” he said.</p>
    <p>“I mean the Amphibs got along fine with the Ssassaror until a new element entered their lives—the Earthmen. Then the antagonising began. What is this new element? It’s the Changelings—the mixture of Earthmen and Amphibs or Ssassaror and Terran. Add it up. Turn it around. Look at it from any angle. It is the Changelings who are behind this restlessness—the Human element.</p>
    <p>“Another thing. The Amphibs have always had Skins different from ours. Our factories create our Skins to set up an affinity and communication between their wearers and all of Nature. They are designed to make it easier for every Man to love his neighbor.</p>
    <p>“Now, the strange thing about the Amphibs’ Skin is that they, too, were once designed to do such things. But in the past thirty or forty years new Skins have been created for one primary purpose—to establish a communication between the Sea-King and his subjects. Not only that, the Skins can be operated at long distances so that the King may punish any disobedient subject. And they are set so that they establish affinity only among the Waterfolk, not between them and all of Nature.”</p>
    <p>“I had gathered some of that during my conversations with Lusine,” said Rastignac. “But I did not know it had gone to such lengths.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, and you may safely bet that the Changelings are behind it.”</p>
    <p>“Then it is the human element that is corrupting?”</p>
    <p>“What else?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac said, “Lusine, what do you say to this?”</p>
    <p>“I think it is best that you leave this world. Or else turn Changeling-Amphib.”</p>
    <p>“Why should I join you Amphibians?”</p>
    <p>“A man like you could become a Sea-King.”</p>
    <p>“And drink blood?”</p>
    <p>“I would rather drink blood than mate with a Man. Almost, that is. But I would make an exception with you, Jean-Jacques.”</p>
    <p>If it had been a Land-woman who made such a blunt proposal he would have listened with equanimity. There was no modesty, false or otherwise, in the country of the Skin-wearers. But to hear such a thing from a woman whose mouth had drunk the blood of a living man filled him with disgust.</p>
    <p>Yet, he had to admit Lusine was beautiful. If she had not been a blood-drinker . . .</p>
    <p>Though he lacked his receptive Skin, Mapfarity seemed to sense Rastignac’s emotions. He said, “You must not blame her too much, Jean-Jacques. Sea-changelings are conditioned from babyhood to love blood. And for a very definite purpose, too, unnatural though it is. When the time comes for hordes of Changelings to sweep out of the sea and overwhelm the Landfolk, they will have no compunctions about cutting the throats of their fellow-creatures.”</p>
    <p>Lusine laughed. The rest of them shifted uneasily but did not comment. Rastignac changed the subject.</p>
    <p>“How did you find out about the' Earthman, Mapfarity?” he said.</p>
    <p>The Ssassaror smiled. Two long yellow canines shone wetly; the nose, which had nostrils set in the sides, gaped open; blue sparks shot out from it; at the same time, the feathered ears stiffened and crackled with red-and-blue sparks.</p>
    <p>“I have been doing something besides breeding geese to lay golden eggs,” he said. “I have set traps for Waterfolk, and I have caught two. These I caged in a dungeon in my castle, and I experimented with them. I removed their Skins and put them on me, and I found out many interesting facts.”</p>
    <p>He leered at Lusine, who was no longer laughing, and he said, “For instance, I discovered that the Sea-King can locate, talk to, and punish any of his subjects anywhere in the sea or along the coast. He has booster Skins planted all over his realm so that any message he sends will reach the receiver, no matter how far away he is. Moreover, he has conditioned each and every Skin so that, by uttering a certain codeword to which only one particular Skin will respond, he may stimulate it to shock or even to kill its carrier.”</p>
    <p>Mapfarity continued, “I analyzed those two Skins in my lab and then, using them as models, made a number of duplicates in my fleshforge. They lacked only the nerves that would enable the Sea-King to shock us.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac smiled his appreciation of this coup. Mapfarity’s ears crackled blue sparks of joy, his equivalent of blushing.</p>
    <p>“Ah, then you have doubtless listened in to many broadcasts. And you know where the Earthman is located?”</p>
    <p>“Yes,” said the Giant. “He is in the palace of the Amphib King, upon the island of Kataproimnoin. That is only thirty miles out to the sea.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac did not know what he would do, but he had two advantages in the Amphibs’ Skins and in Lusine. And he burned to get off this doomed planet, this land of men too sunk in false happiness, sloth, and stupidity to see that soon death would come from the water.</p>
    <p>He had two possible avenues of escape. One was to use the newly arrived Earthman’s knowledge so that the fuels necessary to propel the ferry-rockets could be manufactured. The rockets themselves still stood in a museum. Rastignac had not planned to use them because neither he nor any one else on this planet knew how to make fuel for them. Such secrets had long ago been forgotten.</p>
    <p>But now that science was available through the newcomer from Earth, the rockets could be equipped and taken up to -one of the Six Flying Stars. The Earthman could study the rocket, determine what was needed in the way of supplies, then it could be outfitted for the long voyage.</p>
    <p>An alternative was the Terran’s vessel. Perhaps he might invite him to come along in it . . .</p>
    <p>The huge gateway to Mapfarity’s castle interrupted his thoughts.</p>
   </section>

     <p><strong>VIII</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>He halted the Renault, told Archambaud to find the Giant’s servant and have him feed their vehicle, rub its legs down with liniment, and examine the hooves for defective shoes.</p>
    <p>Archambaud was glad to look up Mapfabvisheen, the Giant’s servant, because he had not seen him for a long time. The little Ssassaror had been an active member of the Egg-stealer’s Guild until the night three years ago when he had tried to creep into Mapfarity’s strongroom. The crafty guilds-man had avoided the Giant’s traps and there found the two geese squatting upon their bed of minerals.</p>
    <p>These fabulous geese made no sound when he picked them up with lead-lined gloves and put them in his bag, also lined with lead-leaf. They were not even aware of him. Laboratory-bred, retort-shaped, their protoplasm a blend of silicon-carbon, unconscious even that they lived, they munched upon lead and other elements, ruminated, gastrated, transmuted, and every month, regular as the clockwork march of stars or whirl of electrons, each laid an octagonal egg of pure gold.</p>
    <p>Mapfabvisheen had trodden softly from the strongroom and thought himself safe. And then, amazingly, frighteningly, and totally unethically, from his viewpoint, the geese had begun honking loudly.</p>
    <p>He had run but not fast enough. The Giant had come stumbling from his bed in response to the wild clamor and had caught him. And, according to the contract drawn up between the Guild of Egg-stealers and the League of Giants, a guildsman seized within the precints of a castle must serve the goose’s owner for two years. Mapfabvisheen had been greedy; he had tried to take both geese. Therefore, he must wait upon the Giant for a double term.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, he found out how he’d been trapped. The egg-layers themselves hadn’t been honking. Mouthless, they were utterly incapable of that. Mapfarity had fastened a so-called “goose-tracker” to the strongroom’s doorway. This device clicked loudly whenever a goose was nearby. It could smell out one even through a lead-leaf-lined bag. When Mapfabvisheen passed underneath it, its chicks woke up a small Skin beside it. The Skin, mostly lung-sac and voice organs, honked its warning. And the dwarf, Mapfabvisheen, began his servitude to the Giant, Mapfarity.</p>
    <p>Rastignac knew the story. He also knew that Mapfarity had infected the fellow with the philosophy of Violence and that he was now a good member of his Underground. He was eager to tell him his servitor days were over, that he could now take his place in their band as an equal. Subject, of course, to Rastignac’s order.</p>
    <p>Mapfabvisheen was stretched out upon the floor and snoring a sour breath. A grey-haired man was slumped on a nearby table. His head, turned to one side, exhibited the same slack-jawed look that the Ssassaror’s had, and he flung the ill-smelling gauntlet of his breath at the visitors. He held an empty bottle in one loose hand. Two other bottles lay on the stone floor, one shattered.</p>
    <p>Besides the bottles lay the men’s Skins. Rastignac wondered why they had not crawled to the halltree and hung themselves up.</p>
    <p>“What ails them? What is that smell?” said Mapfarity.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know,” replied Archambaud, “but I know the visitor. He is Father Jules, priest of the Guild of Egg-stealers.” Rastignac raised his bracket-shaped eyebrows, picked up a bottle in which there remained a slight residue, and drank. “Mon Dieu, it is the sacrament wine!” he cried.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity said, “Why would they be drinking that?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know. Wake Mapfabvisheen up, but let the good father sleep. He seems tired after his spiritual labors and doubtless deserves a rest.”</p>
    <p>Doused with a bucket of cold water the little Ssassaror staggered to his feet. Seeing Archambaud, he embraced him. “Ah, Archambaud, old baby-abductor, my sweet goose-bagger, my ears tingle to see you again!”</p>
    <p>They did. Red and blue sparks flew off his ear-feathers. “What is the meaning of this?” sternly interrupted Mapfarity. He pointed at the dirt swept into the corners.</p>
    <p>Mapfabvisheen drew himself up to his full dignity, which wasn’t much. “Good Father Jules was making his circuits," he said. “You know he travels around the country and hears confession and sings Mass for us poor egg-stealers who have been unlucky enough to fall into the clutches of some rich and greedy and anti-social Giant who is too stingy to hire servants, but captures them instead, and who won’t allow us to leave the premises until our servitude is over . . .”</p>
    <p>“Cut it!” thundered Mapfarity. “I can’t stand around all day, listening to the likes of you. My feet hurt too much. Anyway, you know I’ve allowed you to go into town every week-end. Why don’t you see a priest then?”</p>
    <p>Mapfabvisheen said, “You know very well the closest town is ten kilometers away and it’s full of Pantheists. There’s not a priest to be found there.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac groaned inwardly. Always, it was thus. You could never hurry these people or get them to regard anything seriously.</p>
    <p>Take the case they were wasting their breath on now. Everybody knew the Church had been outlawed a long time ago because it opposed the use of the Skins and certain other practices that went along with it. So, no sooner had that been done than the Ssassarors, anxious to establish their check-and-balance system, had made arrangements through the Minister of Ill-Will to give the Church unofficial legal recognizance.</p>
    <p>Then, though the aborigines had belonged to that pantheistical organization known as the Sons of Good And Old Mother Nature, they had all joined the Church of the Terrans. They operated under the theory that the best way to make an institution innocuous was for everybody to sign up for it. Never persecute. That makes it thrive.</p>
    <p>Much to the Church’s chagrin, the theory worked. How can you fight an enemy who insists on joining you and who will also agree to everything you teach him and then still worship at the other service? Supposedly driven underground, the Church counted almost every Landsman among its supporters from the Kings down.</p>
    <p>Every now and then a priest would forget to wear his Skin out-of-doors and be arrested, then released later in an official jail-break. Those who refused to cooperate were forcibly kidnapped, taken to another town and there let loose. Nor did it do the priest any good to proclaim boldly who he was. Everybody pretended not to know he was a fugitive from justice. They insisted on calling him by his official pseudonym.</p>
    <p>However, few priests were such martyrs. Generations bf Skin-wearing had sapped the ecclesiastical vigor.</p>
    <p>The thing that puzzled Rastignac about Father Jules was the sacrament wine. Neither he nor anybody else in L’Bawpfey, as far as he knew, had ever tasted the liquid outside of the ceremony. Indeed, except for certain of the priests, nobody even knew how to make wine.</p>
    <p>He shook the priest awake, said, “What’s the matter, Father?”</p>
    <p>Father Jules burst into tears. “Ah, my boy, you have caught me in my sin. I am a drunkard.”</p>
    <p>Everybody looked blank. “What does that word <emphasis>drunkard</emphasis> mean?”</p>
    <p>“It means a man who’s damned enough to fill his Skin with alcohol, my boy, fill it until he’s no longer a man but a bccist <sup>w</sup></p>
    <p>“Alcohol? What is that?”</p>
    <p>“The stuff that’s in the wine, my boy. You don’t know what I’m talking about because the knowledge was long ago forbidden except to us of the cloth. Cloth, he saysl Bahl We go around like everybody, naked except for these extra-dermal monstrosities which reveal rather than conceal, which not only serve us as clothing but as mentors, parents, censors, interpreters, and, yes, even as priests. Where’s a bottle that’s not empty? I’m thirsty.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac stuck to the subject. “Why was the making of this alcohol forbidden?”</p>
    <p>“How should I know?” said Father Jules. “I’m old, but not so ancient that I came with the Six Flying Stars . . . Where is that bottle?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac was not offended by his crossness. Priests were notorious for being the most ill-tempered, obstreperous, and unstable of men. They were not at all like the clerics of Earth, whom everybody knew from legend had been sweet-tempered, meek, humble, and obedient to authority. But on L’Bawpfey these men of the Church had reason to be out of sorts. Everybody attended Mass, paid their tithes, went to confession, and did not fall asleep during sermons. Everybody believed what the priests told them and were as good as it was possible for human beings to be. So, the priests had no real incentive to work, no evil to fight.</p>
    <p>Then why the prohibition against alcohol?</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Sacre Bleu!”</emphasis> groaned Father Jules. “Drink as much as I did last night, and you’ll find out. Never again, I say. Ah, there’s another bottle, hidden by a providential fate under my traveling robe. Where’s that corkscrew?”</p>
    <p>Father Jules swallowed half of the bottle, smacked his lips, picked up his Skin from the floor, brushed off the dirt and said, “I must be going, my sons. I’ve a noon appointment with the bishop, and I’ve a good twelve kilometers to travel. Perhaps, one of you gentlemen has a car?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac shook his head and said he was sorry, but their car was tired and had, besides, thrown a shoe. Father Jules shrugged philosophically, put on his Skin and reached out again for the bottle.</p>
    <p>Rastignac said, “Sorry, Father. I’m keeping this bottle.” “For what?” asked Father Jules.</p>
    <p>“Never mind. Say I’m keeping you from temptation.”</p>
    <p>“Bless you, my son, and may you have a big enough hangover to show you the wickedness of your ways.”</p>
    <p>Smiling, Rastignac watched the Father walk out. He was not disappointed. The priest had no sooner reached the huge door than his Skin fell off and lay motionless upon the stone.</p>
    <p>“Ah,” breathed Rastignac. “The same thing happened to Mapfabvisheen when he put his on. There must be something about the wine that deadens the Skins, makes them fall off.”</p>
    <p>After the padre had left, Rastignac handed the bottle to Mapfarity. “Were dedicated to breaking the law most illegally, brother. So I’m asking you to analyze this wine and find out how to make it.”</p>
    <p>“Why not ask Father Jules?”</p>
    <p>“Because priests are pledged never to reveal the secret. That was one of the original agreements whereby the Church was allowed to remain on L’Bawpfey. Or, at least that’s what my parish priest told me. He said it was a good thing, as it removed an evil from man’s temptation. He neVer did say why it was so evil. Maybe he didn’t know.</p>
    <p>“That doesn’t matter. What does matter is that the Church has inadvertently given us a weapon whereby we may free Man from his bondage to the Skins and it has also given itself once again a chance to be really persecuted and to flourish on the blood of its martyrs.”</p>
    <p>“Blood?” said Lusine, licking her lips. “The Churchmen drink blood?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac did not explain. He could be wrong. If so, he’d feel less like a fool if they didn’t know what he thought.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, there were the first steps to be taken for the unskinning of an entire planet.</p>
   </section>

     <p>IX</p>
    </title>
    <p>Later that day, the mucketeers surrounded the castle, but they made no effort to storm it. The following day one of them knocked on the huge front door and presented Mapfarity with a summons requiring them to surrender. The Giant laughed, put the document in his mouth, and ate it. The server fainted and had to be revived with a bucket of cold water before he could stagger back to report this tradition-shattering reception.</p>
    <p>Rastignac set up his underground so it could be expanded in a hurry. He didn’t worry about the blockade because, as was well known, Giants’ castles had all sorts of subterranean tunnels and secret exits. He contacted a small number of priests who were willing to work for him. These were congenital rebels who became quite enthusiastic when he told them their activities would result in a fierce persecution of the Church.</p>
    <p>The majority, however, clung to their Skins and said they would have nothing to do with this extradermal-less devil. They took pride and comfort in that term. The vulgar phrase for the man who refused to wear his Skin was “devil,” and, by law and logic, the Church could not be associated with a devil. As everybody knew, the priests have always been on the side of the angels.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the Devil’s band slipped out of the tunnels and made raids. Their targets were Giants' castles and government treasuries; their loot, the geese. So many raids did they make that the president of the League of Giants and the Business Agent for the Guild of Egg-stealers came to plead with them. And remained to denounce. Rastignac was delighted with their complaints, and, after listening for a while, threw them out.</p>
    <p>Rastignac had, like all other Skin-wearers, always accepted the monetary system as a thing of reason and balance. But, without his Skin, he was able to think objectively, and he saw its weaknesses.</p>
    <p>For some cause buried far in history, the Giants had always had control of the means for making the hexagonal golden coins called <emphasis>oeufs.</emphasis> But the Kings, wishing to get control of the golden eggs, had set up that elite branch of the Guild which specialized in abducting the half-living ‘geese.’ Whenever a thief was successful, he turned the goose over to his King. The monarch, in turn, sent a note to the robbed Giant informing him that the government intended to keep the goose to make its own currency. But even though the Giant was making counterfeit geese, the King, in his generosity, would ship to the Giant one out of every thirty eggs laid by the kidnappee.</p>
    <p>The note was a polite and well-recognized lie. The Giants made the only genuine gold-egg-laying geese on the planet because the Giants’ League alone knew the secret. And the King gave back one-thirtieth of his loot so the Giant could accumulate enough money to buy the materials to create another goose. Which would, possibly, be stolen later on.</p>
    <p>Rastignac, by his illegal rape of geese, was making money scarce. Peasants were hanging on to their produce and waiting to sell until prices were at their highest. The government, merchants, the league, the guild, all saw themselves impoverished.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the Amphibs, taking note of the situation, were making raids of their own and blaming them on Rastignac.</p>
    <p>He did not care. He was intent on trying to find a way to reach Kataproimnoin and rescue the Earthman so he could take off in the spaceship floating in the harbor. But he knew that he would have to take things slowly, to scout out the land and plan accordingly.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, Mapfarity had made him promise he would do his best to set up the Landsmen so they would be able to resist the Waterfolk when the day for war came.</p>
    <p>Rastignac made his biggest raid when he and his band stole one moonless night into the capital itself to rob the big Goose House, only an egg’s throw away from the Palace and the Ministry of Ill-Will. They put the Goose House guards to sleep with little arrows smeared with dream-snake venom, filled their lead-leaf-lined bags with gold eggs, and sneaked out the back door.</p>
    <p>As they left, Rastignac saw a cloaked figure slinking from the back door of the Ministry. On impulse, he tackled the figure. It was an Amphib-changeling. Rastignac struck the Amphib with a venomous arrow before the Water-human could cry out or stab back.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity grabbed up the limp Amphib and they raced for the safety of the castle.</p>
    <p>They questioned the Amphib, Pierre Pusipremnoos, in the castle. At first silent, he later began talking freely when Mapfarity got a heavy Skin from his flesh-forge and put it on the fellow. It was a Skin modeled after those worn by the Water-people, but it differed in that the Giant could control, through another Skin, the powerful neural shocks.</p>
    <p>After a few shocks, Pierre admitted he was the foster-son of the Amphibian King and that, incidentally, Lusine was his foster-sister. He further stated he was a messenger between the Amphib King and the Ssarraror’s Ill-Will Minister.</p>
    <p>More shocks extracted the fact that the Minister of Ill-Will, Auverpin, was an Amphib-changeling who was passing himself off as a bom Landsman. Not only that, the Human hostages among the Amphibs were about to stage a carefully planned revolt against the bom Amphibs. It would kill off about half of them. The rest would then be brought under control of the Master Skin.</p>
    <p>When the two stepped from the lab, they were attacked by Lusine, knife in hand. She gashed Rastignac in the arm before he knocked her out with an uppercut. Later, while Mapfarity applied a little jelly-like creature called a <emphasis>scar-jester</emphasis> to the wound, Rastignac complained:</p>
    <p>“I don’t know if I can endure much more of this. I thought the way of Violence would not be hard to follow because I hated the Skins and the Amphibs so much. But it is easier to attack a faceless, hypothetical enemy, or torture him, than the individual enemy. Much easier.”</p>
    <p>“My brother,” boomed the Giant, “if you continue to dwell upon the philosophical implications of your actions, you will end up as helpless and confused as the leg-counting centipede. Better not think. Warriors are not supposed to. They lose their keen fighting edge when they think. And you need all of that now.”</p>
    <p>“I would suppose that thought would sharpen them.” “When issues are simple, yes. But you must remember that the system on this planet is anything but uncomplicated. It was set up to confuse, to keep one always off balance. Just tiy to keep one thing in mind—the Skins are far more of an impediment to Man than they are a help. Also, that if the Skins don’t come off, the Amphibs will soon be cutting our throats. The only way to save ourselves is to kill them first. Right?”</p>
    <p>“I suppose so,” said Rastignac. He stooped and put his hands under the unconscious Lusine’s armpits. “Help me put her in a room. We’ll keep her locked up until she cools off.</p>
    <p>Then we’ll use her to guide us when we get to Kataproimnoin. Which reminds me—how many gallons of the wine have you made so far?”</p>

    <p>A week later Rastignac summoned Lusine. She came in frowning and with her lower lip protruding in a pretty pout.</p>
    <p>He said, “Day after tomorrow is the day on which the new Kings are crowned, isn’t it?”</p>
    <p>Tonelessly, she said, “Supposedly. Actually, the present Kings will be crowned again.”    <emphasis><sup>1</sup></emphasis></p>
    <p>Rastignac smiled. “I know. Peculiar, isn’t it, how the ‘people’ always vote the same Kings back into power? However, that isn’t what I’m getting at. If I remember correctly, the Amphibs give their King exotic and amusing gifts on coronation day. What do you think would happen if I took a big shipload of bottles of wine and passed it out among the population just before the Amphibs begin their surprise massacre?”</p>
    <p>Lusine had seen Mapfarity and Rastignac experimenting with the wine, and she had been frightened by the results. Nevertheless, she made a brave attempt to hide her fear now. She spit at him and said, “You mud-footed fooll There are priests who will know what it isl They will be in the coronation crowd.”</p>
    <p>“Ah, not sol In the first place, you Amphibs are almost entirely Aggressive Pantheists. You have only a few priests, and you will now pay for that omission of wine-tasters. Second, Mapfarity’s concoction tastes not at all vinous and is twice as strong.”</p>
    <p>She spat at him again and spun on her heel and walked out. That night Rastignac’s band and Lusine went through a tunnel which brought them up through a hollow tree about two miles west of the castle. There they hopped into the Renault, which had been kept in a camouflaged garage, and drove to the little port of Marrec. Archambaud had paved their way here with golden eggs and a sloop was waiting for them.</p>
    <p>Rastignac took the boat’s wheel. Lusine stood beside him, ready to answer the challenge of any Amphib patrol that tried to stop them. As the Amphib-King’s foster-daughter, she could get the boat through to the Amphib island without any trouble at all.</p>
    <p>Archambaud stood behind her, a knife under his cloak, to make sure she did not try to betray them. Lusine had sworn she could be trusted. Rastignac had answered that he was sure she could be, too, as long as the knife point pricked her back to remind her.</p>
    <p>Nobody stopped them. An hour before dawn they 'mchored in the harbor of Kataproimnoin. Lusine was tied hand and foot inside the cabin. Before Rastignac could scratch her with dream-snake venom, she pleaded, “You could not do this to me, Jean-Jacques, if you loved me.”</p>
    <p>“Who said anything about loving you?”</p>
    <p>“Well, I like that! You said so, you cheat!”</p>
    <p>“Oh, <emphasis>then!</emphasis> Well, Lusine, you’ve had enough experience to know that such protestations of tenderness and affection are only inevitable accompaniments of the moment’s passion.” For the first time since he had known her, he saw Lusine’s lower lip tremble and tears come in her eyes. “Do you mean you were only using me?” she sobbed.</p>
    <p>“You forget I had good reason to think you were just using <emphasis>me.</emphasis> Remember, you’re an Amphib, Lusine. Your people can’t be trusted. You blood-drinkers are as savage as the little sea-monsters you leave in Human cradles.”</p>
    <p>“Jean-Jacques, take me with you! I’ll do anything you say! I’ll even cut my foster-father’s throat for you!”</p>
    <p>He laughed. Unheeding, she swept on. “I want to be with you, Jean-Jacques! Look, with me to guide you in my homeland—with my prestige as the Amphib-King’s daugh-ler—you can become King yourself after the rebellion. I’d get rid of the Amphib-King for you so there’ll be nobody in your way!”</p>
    <p>She felt no more guilt than a tigress. She was naive and terrible, innocent and disgusting.</p>
    <p>“No, thanks, Lusine.” He scratched her with the dream-snake needle. As her eyes closed, he said, “You don’t understand. All I want to do is voyage to the stars. Being King means nothing to me. The only person I’d trade places with would be the Earthman the Amphibs hold prisoner.”</p>
    <p>He left her sleeping in the locked cabin.</p>
    <p>Noon found them loafing on the great square in front of the Palace of the Two Kings of The Sea and The Islands. All were disguised as Waterfolk. Before they’d left the castle, they had grafted webs between their fingers and toes—jujjt as Amphib-changelings who weren’t bom with them, did— and they wore the special Amphib Skins that Mapfarity had grown in his fleshforge. These were able to tune in on the Amphibs’ wavelengths, but they lacked their shock mechanism.</p>
    <p>Rastignac had to locate the Earthman, rescue him, and get him to the spaceship that lay anchored between two wharfs, its sharp nose pointing outwards. A wooden bridge had been built from one of the wharfs to a place halfway up its towering side.</p>
    <p>Rastignac could not make out any breaks in the smooth metal that would indicate a port, but reason told him there must be some sort of entrance to the ship at that point.</p>
    <p>A guard of twenty Amphibs repulsed any attempt on the crowd’s part to get on the bridge.</p>
    <p>Rastignac had contacted the harbor-master and made arrangements for workmen to unload his cargo of wine. His freehandedness with the gold eggs got him immediate service even on this general holiday. Once in the square, he and his men uncrated the wine but left the two heavy chests on the wagon which was hitched to a powerful little six-legged Jeep.</p>
    <p>They stacked the bottles of wine in a huge pile while the curious crowd in the square encircled them to watch. Rastignac then stood on a chest to survey the scene, so that he could best judge the time to start. There were perhaps seven or eight thousand of all three races there— the Ssassarors, the Amphibs, the Humans—with an unequal portioning of each.</p>
    <p>Rastignac, looking for just such a thing, noticed that every non-human Amphib had at least two Humans tagging at his heels.</p>
    <p>It would take two Humans to handle an Amphib or a Ssassaror. The Amphibs stood upon their seal-like hind flippers at least six and a half feet tall and weighed about three hundred pounds. The Giant Ssassarors, being fisheaters, had reached the same enormous height as Mapfarity. The Giants were in the minority, as the Amphibs had always preferred stealing Human babies from the Terrans. The Ssas-saror-changelings were marked for death also.</p>
    <p>Rastignac watched for signs of uneasiness or hostility between the three groups. Soon, he saw the signs. They were not plentiful, but they were enough to indicate an uneasy undercurrent. Three times, the guards had to intervene to break up quarrels. The Humans eyed the non-human quarrelers, but made no move to help their Amphib fellows against the Giants. Not only that, they took them aside afterwards and seemed to be reprimanding them. Evidently, the order was that everyone was to be on his behavior until the time to revolt.</p>
    <p>Rastignac glanced at the great tower-clock. “It’s an hour before the ceremonies begin,” he said to his men. “Let’s go.”</p>

     <p>XI</p>
    </title>
    <p>Mapfabity, who had been loitering in the crowd some distance away, caught Archambaud’s signal and slowly, as befit a Giant whose feet hurt, limped towards them. He stopped, scrutinized the pile of bottles, then, in his lion’s-roar-at-the-bottom-of-a-well voice said, “Say, what’s in these bottles?” Rastignac shouted back, “A drink which the new Kings will enjoy very much.”</p>
    <p>“What’s that?” replied Mapfarity. “Sea-water?”</p>
    <p>The crowd laughed.</p>
    <p>“No, it’s not water,” Rastignac said, “as anybody but a lumbering Giant should know. It is a delicious drink that brings a rare ecstacy upon the drinker. I got the formula for it from an old witch who lives on the shores of far off Apfelabvidanahyew. He told me it had been in his family since the coming of Man to L’Bawpfey. He parted with the formula on condition I make it only for the Kings.”</p>
    <p>“Will only Their Majesties get to taste this exquisite drink?” bellowed Mapfarity.</p>
    <p>“That depends upon whether it pleases Their Majesties to give some to their subjects to celebrate the result of the elections.”</p>
    <p>Archambaud, also planted in the crowd, shrilled, “I suppose if they do, the big-paunched Amphibs and Giants will get twice as much as us Humans. They always do, it seems/’ There was a mutter from the crowd; approbation from the Amphibs, protest from the others.</p>
    <p>“That will make no difference,” said Rastignac, smiling. “The fascinating thing about this is that an Amphib can drink no more than a Human. That may be why the old man who revealed his secret to me called the drink Old Equalizer.”</p>
    <p>“Ah, you’re skinless,” scoffed Mapfarity, throwing the most deadly insult known. “I can out-drink, out-eat, and out-swim any Human here. Here, Amphib, give me a bottle, and we’ll see if I’m bragging.”</p>
    <p>An Amphib captain pushed himself through the throng, waddling clumsily on his flippers like an upright seal.</p>
    <p>“No, you don’t!” he barked. “Those bottles are intended for the Kings. No commoner touches them, least of all a Human and a Giant.”</p>
    <p>Rastignac mentally hugged himself. He couldn’t have planned a better intervention himself! “Why can’t I?” he replied. “Until I make an official presentation, these bottles are mine, not the Kings'. I’ll do what I want with them.” “Yeah,” said the Amphibs. “That’s telling him!”</p>
    <p>The Amphib’s big brown eyes narrowed, and his animal-like face wrinkled, but he couldn’t think of a retort. Rastignac at once handed a bottle apiece to each of his comrades. They uncorked and drank and then assumed an ecstatic expression which was a tribute to their acting, for these three bottles held only fruit juice.</p>
    <p>“Look here, captain,” said Rastignac, “why don’t you try a swig yourself? Go ahead. There’s plenty. And I’m sure Their Majesties would be pleased to contribute some of it on this joyous occasion. Besides, I can always make more for the Kings.</p>
    <p>“As a matter of fact,” he added, winking, “I expect to get a pension from the courts as the Kings’ Old Equalizer-maker.”</p>
    <p>The crowd laughed. The Amphib, afraid of losing face, took the bottle—which contained wine rather than fruit juice. After a few long swallows, the Amphib’s eyes became red and a silly grin curved his thin, black-edged lips. Finally, in a thickening voice, he asked for another bottle.</p>
    <p>Rastignac, in a sudden burst of generosity, not only gave him one, but began passing out bottles to the many eager reaching hands. Mapfarity and the two egg-thieves helped him. In a short time, the pile of bottles had dwindled to a fourth of its former height. When a mixed group of guards strode up and demanded to know what the commotion was about, Rastignac gave them some of the bottles.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Archambaud slipped off into the mob. He lurched into an Amphib, said something nasty about his ancestors, and pulled his knife. When the Amphib lunged for the little man, Archambaud jumped back and shoved a Human-Amphib into the giant flipper-like arms.</p>
    <p>Within a minute, the square had erupted into a fighting mob. Staggering, red-eyed, slur-tongued, their long-repressed hostility against each other released by the liquor which (heir bodies were unaccustomed to, Human, Ssassaror and Amphib fell to with the utmost will, slashing, slugging, fighting with everything they had.</p>
    <p>None of them noticed that every one who had drunk from the bottles had lost his Skin. The Skins had fallen off one by one and lay motionless on the pavement where they were kicked or stepped upon. Not one Skin tried to crawl back to its owner because they were all nerve-numbed by the wine.</p>
    <p>Rastignac, seated behind the wheel of the Jeep, began driving as best he could through the battling mob. After frequent stops, he halted before the broad marble steps that ran like a stairway to heaven, up and up before it ended on the Porpoise Porch of the Palace. He and his gang were about to take the two heavy chests off the wagon when they were transfixed by a scene before them.</p>
    <p>A score of dead Humans and Amphibs lay on the steps, evidence of the fierce struggle that had taken place between the guards of the two monarchs. Evidently, the King had heard of the riot and hastened outside. There the Amphib-changeling King had apparently realized that the rebellion was way ahead of schedule, but he had attacked the Amphib King anyway.</p>
    <p>And he had won, for his guardsmen held the struggling flipper-footed Amphib ruler down while two others bent his head back over a step. The Changeling-King himself, still clad in the coronation robes, was about to draw his long ceremonial knife across the exposed and palpitating throat of the Amphib King.</p>
    <p>This in itself was enough to freeze the onlookers. But the sight of Lusine running up the stairway towards the rulers added to their paralysis. She had a knife in her hand and was holding it high as she ran toward her foster-father, the Amphib King.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity groaned, but Rastignac said, “It doesn’t matter that she has escaped. We’ll go ahead with our original plan.”</p>
    <p>They began unloading the chests while Rastignac kept an eye on Lusine. He saw her run up, stop, say a few words to the Amphib King, then kneel and stab him, burying the knife in his jugular vein. Then, before anybody could stop her, she had applied her mouth to the cut in his neck.</p>
    <p>The Human-King kicked her in the ribs and sent her rolling down the steps. Rastignac saw correctly that it was not her murderous deed that caused his reaction. It was because she had dared to commit it without his permission and had also drunk the royal blood first.</p>
    <p>He further noted with grim satisfaction that when Lusine recovered from the blow and ran back up to talk to the King, he ignored her. She pointed at the group around the wagon but he dismissed her with a wave of his hand. He was too busy gloating over his vanquished rival lying at his feet.</p>
    <p>The plotters hoisted the two chests and staggered up the steps. The King passed them as he went down with no more than a curious glance. Gifts had been coming up those steps all day for the King, so he undoubtedly thought of them only as more gifts. So Rastignac and his men walked past the knives of the guards as if they had nothing to fear.</p>
    <p>Lusine stood alone at the top of the steps. She was in a half-crouch, knife ready. “I’ll kill the King, and I’ll drink from his throat!” she cried hoarsly. “No man kicks me except for love. Has he forgotten that I am the foster-daughter of the Amphib King?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac felt revulsion but he had learned by now that those who deal in violence and rebellion must march with strange steppers.</p>
    <p>“Bear a hand here,” he said, ignoring her threat.</p>
    <p>Meekly she grabbed hold of a chest’s comer. To his further questioning, she replied that the Earthman who had landed in the ship was held in a suite of rooms in the west wing. Their trip thereafter was fast and direct. Unopposed, they carted the chests to the huge room where the Master Skin was kept.</p>
    <p>There they found ten frantic biotechnicians excitedly trying to determine why the great extraderm—the Master Skin through which all individual Skins were controlled—was not broadcasting properly. They had no way as yet of knowing that it was operating perfectly but that the little Skins upon the Amphibs and their hostage Humans were not shocking them into submission because they were lying in a wine-stupor on the ground. No one had told them that the Skins, which fed off the bloodstream of their hosts, had become anesthetized from the alcohol and failed any longer to react to their Master Skin.</p>
    <p>That, of course, applied only to those Skins in the square that were drunk from the wine. Elsewhere all over the kingdom, Amphibs writhed in agony and Ssassarors and Terrans were taking advantage of their helplessness to cut their throats. But not here, where the crux of the matter was.</p>

     <p>XII</p>
    </title>
    <p>The Landsmen rushed the techs and pushed them into the great chemical vat in which the twenty-five hundred foot square Master Skin floated. Then they uncrated the lead-leaf-lined bags filled with stolen geese and emptied them into the nutrient fluid. According to Mapfarity’s calculations, the radio-activity from the silicon-carbon geese should kill the big Skin within a few days. When a new one was grown, that, too, would die. Unless the Amphib guessed what was wrong and located the geese on the bottom of the ten-foot deep tank, they would not be able to stop the process. That did not seem likely.</p>
    <p>In either case, it was necessary that the Master Skin be put out of temporary commission, at least, so the Amphibs over the Kingdom could have a fighting chance. Mapfarity plunged a hollow harpoon into the isle of floating protoplasm and through a tube connected to that poured into the Skin three gallons of the dream-snake venom. That was enough to knock it out for an hour or two. Meanwhile, if the Amphibs had any sense at all, they’d have rid themselves of their extraderms.</p>
    <p>They left the lab and entered the west wing. As they trotted up the long winding corridors Lusine said, “Jean-Jacques, what do you plan on doing now? Will you try to make yourself King of the Terrans and fight us Amphib-changelings?” When he said nothing, she went on. “Why don’t you kill the Amphib-changeling King and take over here? I could help you do that. You could then have all of L’Bawpfey in your power.”</p>
    <p>He shot her a look of contempt and cried, “Lusine, can't you get it through that thick little head of yours that everything I’ve done has been done so that I can win one goal: reach the Flying Stars? If I can get the Earthman to his ship I’ll leave with him and not set foot again for years on this planet. Maybe never again.”</p>
    <p>She looked stricken. “But what about the war here?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“There are a few men among the Landfolk who are capable of leading in wartime. It will take strong men, and there are very few like me, I admit, but—oh, oh, oppositionl” He broke off at sight of the six guards who stood before the Earthman’s suite.</p>
    <p>Lusine helped, and within a minute they had slain three and chased away the others. Then they burst through the door—and Rastignac received another shock.</p>
    <p>The occupant of the apartment was a tiny and exquisitely formed redhead with large blue eyes and very unmasculine curves!</p>
    <p>“I thought you said Earthman?” protested Rastignac to the Giant who came lumbering along behind them.</p>
    <p>“Oh, I used that in the generic sense,” Mapfarity replied. "You didn’t expect me to pay any attention to sex, did you? I’m not interested in the gender of you Humans, you know.”</p>
    <p>There was no time for reproach. Rastignac tried to explain lo the Earthwoman who he was, but she did not understand liim. However, she did seem to catch on to what he wanted and seemed reassured by his gestures. She picked up a large book from a table and, hugging it to her small, high, and rounded bosom, went with him out the door.</p>
    <p>They raced from the palace and descended onto the square. Here, they found the surviving Amphibs clustered into a solid phalanx and fighting, bloody step by step, towards the street that led to the harbor.</p>
    <p>Rastignac’s little group skirted the battle and started down the steep avenue toward the harbor. Halfway down, he glanced back and saw that nobody as yet was paying an; attention to them. Nor was there anybody on the street t both them, though the pavement was strewn with Skins am bodies. Apparently, those who’d lived through the firs savage mel£e had gone to the square.</p>
    <p>They ran onto the wharf. The Earthwoman motioned t&lt; Rastignac that she knew how to open the spaceship, but th Amphibs didn’t. Moreover, if they did get in, they wouldn know how to operate it. She had the directions for so doinj in the book hugged so desperately to her chest. Rastigna surmised she hadn’t told the Amphibs about that. Appar ently they hadn’t, as yet, tried to torture the informatioi from her.</p>
    <p>Therefore, her telling him about the book indicated sh trusted him.</p>
    <p>Lusine said, “Now what, Jean-Jacques? Are you still goinj to abandon this planet?”</p>
    <p>“Of course,” he snapped.</p>
    <p>“Will you take me with you?”</p>
    <p>He had spent most of his life under the tutelage of hi Skin, which ensured that others would know when he wa; lying. It did not come easy to hide his true feelings. So <emphasis>i</emphasis> habit of a lifetime won out.</p>
    <p>“I will not take you,” he said. “In the first place, thougl you may have some admirable virtues, I’ve failed to detec one. In the second place, I could not stand your blood drinking nor your murderous and totally immoral ways.”</p>
    <p>“But, Jean-Jacques, I will give them up for you!”</p>
    <p>“Can,the shark stop eating fish?”</p>
    <p>“You would leave Lusine, who loves you as no Earthwomai could, and go with that—that pale little doll I could breal with my hands?”</p>
    <p>“Be quiet,” he said. “I have dreamed of this moment al my life. Nothing can stop me now.”</p>
    <p>They were on the wharf beside the bridge that ran u{ the smooth side of the starship. The guard was no longei there, though bodies showed that there had been reluctanc&lt; on the part of some to leave.</p>
    <p>They let the Earthwoman precede them up the bridge. Lusine suddenly ran ahead of him, crying, “If you won’t have me, you won’t have her, either! Nor the stars!”</p>
    <p>Her knife sank twice into the Earthwoman’s back. Then, before anybody could reach her, she had leaped off the bridge and into the harbor.</p>
    <p>Rastignac knelt beside the Earthwoman. She held out the book to him, then she died. He caught the volume before it struck the wharf.</p>
    <p>“My God! My God!” moaned Rastignac, stunned with grief and shock and sorrow. Sorrow for the woman and shock at the loss of the ship and the end of his plans for freedom.</p>
    <p>Mapfarity ran up then and took the book from his nerveless hand. “She indicated that this is a manual for running the ship,” he said. “All is not lost.”</p>
    <p>“It will be in a language we don’t know,” Rastignac whispered.</p>
    <p>Archambaud came running up, shrilled, “The Amphibs have broken through and are coming down the street! Let’s get to our boat before the whole bloodthirsty mob gets here!”</p>
    <p>Mapfarity paid him no attention. He thumbed through the book, then reached down and lifted Rastignac from his crouching position by the corpse.</p>
    <p>“There’s hope yet, Jean-Jacques,” he growled. “This book is printed with the same characters as those I saw in a book owned by a priest I knew. He said it was in Hebrew, and that it was the Holy Book in the original Earth language. This woman must be a citizen of the Republic of Israeli, which I understand was rising to be a great power on Earth at the lime you French left.</p>
    <p>“Perhaps, the language of this woman has changed somewhat from the original tongue, but I don’t think the alphabet has. I’ll bet that if we get this to a priest who can read it— there are only a few left—he can translate it well enough for us to figure out everything.”</p>
    <p>They walked to the wharf’s end and climbed down a ladder to a platform where a dory was tied up. As they rowed out to their sloop Mapfarity said:</p>
    <p>“Look, Rastignac, things aren’t as bad as they seem. If you haven’t the ship nobody else has, either. And you alone have the key to its entrance and operation. For that you can thank the Church, which has preserved the ancient wisdom for emergencies which it couldn’t forsee, such as this. Just as it kept the secret of wine, which will eventually be the greatest means for delivering our people from their bondage to the Skins and, thus enable them to fight the Amphibs back instead of being slaughtered.</p>
    <p>“Meanwhile, we’ve a battle to wage. You will have to lead it. Nobody else but the Skinless Devil has the prestige to make the people gather around him. Once we accuse the Minister of Ill-Will of treason and jail him, without an official Breaker to release him, we’ll demand a general election. You’ll be made King of the Ssassaror; I, of the Terrans. That is inevitable, for we are the only skinless men and, therefore, irresistible. After the war is won, we’ll leave for the stars. How do you like that?”</p>
    <p>Rastignac smiled. It was weak, but it was a smile. His bracket-shaped eyebrows bent into their old sign of determination.</p>
    <p>“You are right,” he replied. “I have given it much thought. A man has no right to leave his native land until he’s settled his problems here. Even if Lusine hadn’t killed the Earthwoman and I had sailed away, my conscience wouldn’t have given me any rest. I would have known I had abandoned the fight in the middle of it. But now that I have stripped myself of my Skin—which was a substitute for a conscience— and now that I am being forced to develop my own inward conscience, I must admit that immediate flight to the stars would have been the wrong thing.”</p>
    <p>The pleased Mapfarity said, “And you must also admit, Rastignac, that things so far have had a way of working out for the best. Even Lusine, evil as she was, has helped towards the general good by keeping you on this planet. And the Church, though it has released once again the old evil of alcohol, has done more good by so doing than . .</p>
    <p>But here Rastignac interrupted to say he did not believe in this particular school of thought, and so, while the howls of savage warriors drifted from the wharfs, while the structure of their world crashed around them, they plunged into that most violent and circular of all whirlpools—the Discussion Philosophical.</p>

    <p><strong>THE CELESTIAL BLUEPRINT</strong></p>
   </title>
   <section>
    <title>
     <p><strong>I</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>The arrogance with which B. T. Revanche strode through the outer office of Bioid Electronic was enough to convince anyone that he was a V.V.I.P. His little eyes straying neither to left nor right, long fat cigar stabbed straight ahead, quilllike hair bristling in all directions, he was a stout little porcupine of a man. And like that spear-backed creature, he knew that no one would stop him. If they did, they’d regret it— so help them!</p>
    <p>Very few people ever paced so fearlessly through the waiting rooms of Bioid. Most persons sat a long time on the “heel-cooling” chairs, and when they were summoned to enter the Sanctum Sanctorum, they were seldom escorted by a Bioid treacher.</p>
    <p>But B. T. Revanche—contrary to rumor, the initials did not stand for Blood Thirsty—walked into the skyscraper that overlooked the free city of Messina, and did not bother to announce himself. Taking it for granted that he’d be recognized wherever he went, he did not even switch off his personal anti-espionage field.</p>
    <p>Such a gesture of simple courtesy would have seemed to him an affront to his prestige.</p>
    <p>He brushed aside those who looked as if they might get in his way, stepped into an antigravity elevator, and was whisked up fifty stories to the immense suite of Bioid’s GHQ. There, a gold-plated treacher picked him up and preceded him, barking out his name with flattering precision.</p>
    <p>“Make way for Signor Revanche! One side or a leg off, please! Lo, he cometh!”</p>
    <p>Revanche frowned, and bit down on his cigar. He didn’t like the slightest suspicion of levity in regard to himself.</p>
    <p>Despite a twinge of annoyance, however, he was impressed by the offices. Blazing slogans hung along the walls: <emphasis>Bioid is more than skin deep! Our trinity</emphasis>: <emphasis>Art</emphasis> &amp; <emphasis>Science</emphasis> &amp; <emphasis>Da Vincelleo! Perfect both inside and out! For the Gods —and Da Vincelleo!</emphasis></p>
    <p>Diagrams and sketches of the great Messinan’s works hung here and there—drawings of the human body in various positions, along with pictures of Bioid robots in corresponding postures.</p>
    <p>Poised on plastiglass were germanium brains, startlingly life-like statues that breathed, and a mounted gorilla, last of his species, shot by the great Da Vincelleo himself. If you stepped on a plate set in the floor while admiring it, it would reach out for you—reach out and roar loud enough to scare the shorts off you.</p>
    <p>B. T. Revanche paused for an instant before one of the statues, and manipulated a dial at its base. It was that of an attractive woman clothed in a simple tunic of green-gold gauze, her limbs gazelle-slender in the glare.</p>
    <p>“Speak to me, baby,” he said.</p>
    <p>The plastiskin woman spoke, her lips arching in a seductive smile. “Good afternoon, man of culture. I am not alive, but there is a grace and beauty in all of Da Vincello’s creations, and, when you look at them, you forget that you have come here to pass an idle hour.</p>
    <p>“The veils of the artificial are stripped away, and for a moment you gaze upon beauty naked and unadorned. Would you not like to take me into your arms?”</p>
    <p>“I sure would, baby!” Revanche whispered.</p>
    <p>He knew, of course, that the statue could not hear him.</p>
    <p>But, by timing his questions to correspond with its disk-recorded utterances, an illusion of conversation could be maintained. To imagine even for a brief instant that he could bend so lovely a creature to his will brought out all of his sadism.</p>
    <p>“I’m not interested in you as a work of art, baby,” he said. “I guess you know that.”</p>
    <p>“Pass on, man of culture,” the statue said. “You linger too long here. If you look about you, you will find others more beautiful than II”</p>
    <p>Abruptly the illusion snapped. Scowling, feeling cheated, Revanche swung about, and resumed his arrogant stride.</p>
    <p>There were many vivoil paintings of scenes that gave the illusion, if you looked at them obliquely, of leaves fluttering, birds flying, women walking, and water flowing. All were signed with the name of the famed poet-scientist-financier-engineer-architect-painter-sculptor-cybemeticist and lover of the Second Italian Renaissance—Benangelo Michelardo Da Vincelleo.</p>
    <p>There was only one man on Earth who was more widely known, more powerful. It was a measure of B. T. Revanche’s importance that no practical jokes were played on <emphasis>him.</emphasis></p>
    <p>Da Vincello was famous for his complicated, rubegold-bergish, and sometimes morbid sense of humor. Visitors had to have strong nerves if they cared to see him—and survive.</p>
    <p>It was not unusual for trapdoors to open beneath their feet and drop them, kicking and screaming, down a two-story shaft before they were eased by antigrav to a slow stop. Or for a visitor to find the doorknob to the master’s office had turned into a shriveled plastic head. Or to step into what he thought was the office, and find himself neck-deep in water, or some less acceptable fluid.</p>
    <p>If the enraged victim stalked off, Da Vincelleo howled with glee. And if a lawsuit followed, he had ways of scaring the unhappy wretch into withdrawing it.</p>
    <p>The office help—including the thirty vice-presidents— earned big salaries largely because they boasted iron nerves and ulcer-resistant stomachs. After their imitation into Da Vincelleo’s extraordinary humor, many of them became quite sedate about the embarrasing noises and odors they seemingly made when they sat down on their chairs.</p>
    <p>They even regarded with the classic calm of the clam’s eye the lightbulbs that exploded and flew apart, the mechanical mice, the cockroaches that jumped out of opened drawers, and the waterfaucets that straightened out and squirted them in the face. The few who couldn’t take it ceased drawing fabulous salaries, and retired to rest homes.</p>
    <p>As it was, none of these disturbing things interfered with Revanche’s progress. He didn’t even pause on entering the Sanctum Sanctorum itself.</p>

     <p><strong>II</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>Da Vincelleo was sitting behind a large desk with a Cellini-exquisite reading lamp at his elbow. He was clad only in a pair of businessman’s electric-blue shorts, and a scarlet beret. His forehead was lofty and square, a beautifully sculptured Greek temple dedicated to Thought. But the face that hung beneath was a fox’s, and the eyes were twin furnaces, red-rimmed and smouldering. Sometimes, beauty burned phoenixlike in them—more often, dollar bills.</p>
    <p>Da Vincelleo barely had time to swing the tape-thrower back into its cabinet. He had just finished reviewing a case history of Revanche’s life. His agents had done a superb job on Revanche. He knew more about the great financier than that complex man himself, for included in the report were the opinions of ten top-flight psychiatrists. Despite the fact that all the reports were contradictory, the master of Bioid felt he had an excellent insight into his rival’s psyche.</p>
    <p>The Messinan had painstakingly studied Revanche’s psych index as a child. He knew that the formative years counted most, for the child was father to the man. Understanding what kind of youngster Revanche had been gave him an advantage from the start.</p>
    <p>Therefore, when the magnate bounded bristling into his office, he remained seated, sure that he had the upper hand.</p>
    <p>B. T. faced him for a moment without greeting him, giving him the famous “once-over,” the scanning that had made strong men shake. His eyes were as hard as a Bioid’s. His nose had been heavily powdered, so that the tiny line which circled its tip would be concealed. The cleavage betrayed the artificiality of the tip, which was made of plasto-skin.</p>
    <p>Revanche let his eyes crawl up and down his host like measuring worms. Then, abruptly, frankly, he came to the point of his visit. His request, and the whirlwind fury with which he thrust it, shook Da Vincelleo out of his sureness, brought him to his feet with a gasp.</p>
    <p>“Di’, man!” he muttered hoarsely. “What’re you saying? That could only mean . . .”</p>
    <p>“Da Vincelleo!” barked Revanche. He coughed the words out of the side of his mouth, without removing his cigar.</p>
    <p>“My agents report you’re hard as etemalloy,” he went on, without giving the other a chance to reply. “They say you have the artistic genius of a Buonarotti, the ruthless ambition of a Borgia, and the depraved humor of a Caligulal”</p>
    <p>The Messinan did not flinch. He looked pleased, as well he might, for Revanche meant the epithets as compliments.</p>
    <p>“You’ll stop at nothing to get what you want,” the financier emphasized. “It was your remorseless drive and executive ability that made you build Bioid with only a servoshoeshiner as a start. And you know as well as I do that you stole the money to buy the servo from your blind and penniless mother!”</p>
    <p>Da Vincelleo blinked. He had thought no one had known about that. But after all, what did he care? His mother had been paid back. He had buried her in a beautifully designed gold coffin.</p>
    <p>“My psychologists say one of your ambitions is to become the richest, most powerful man in the System. Unfortunately, I’m in your way. Well, if you’ll do as I ask I’m prepared to turn over my entire holdings to you!”</p>
    <p>Da Vincelleo’s rusty-brown eyes flaked with red desire. “How could I?” he countered. “If I tried it, I’d have to get out of the System. Every free city, every planet would band together to attack me. The universe would howl for my blood. What’s wrong with you, Revanche, that you can’t see that? Are you seriously trying to get me killed—or is it your contempt for the creative intellect which prevents you from realizing how the dogs would howl?”</p>
    <p>“Let them howl!” Revanche countered. “I’ll sign over my entire fortune to you. I’ll make you president and owner of my company. We’ll draw up a contract which will make me head of Bioid. That way, I’ll bear all the responsibility. All, do you hear? You’ll actually be directing operations, but you’ll be legally blameless. Do you understand? Immediately after the job is finished, Bioid reverts to you.”</p>
    <p>“And you, Revanche. What are <emphasis>you</emphasis> going to do?”</p>
    <p>“As soon as my revenge is satisfied, I’ll take my yacht to the newly-discovered planet of Alpha Draconis. I’ll be beyond extradition there. I’ll start business all over again. It’s a raw planet that offers a challenge to me this tame System has lost.”</p>
    <p>“Well, I don’t know. I’ll need time to think.”</p>
    <p>Revanche growled, then barked: “My agents say you’re famous for making electronicfast decisions. Tell me right now—or I go to your competitor.</p>
    <p>“Think, man,” he went on quickly. “You’re an engineer, and an artist. It will be the culmination, the masterpiece of your career. Historically speaking, Buonarotti or Nero won’t be able to hold a candle to you. And you’ll also be the richest man under the sun.”</p>
    <p>Da Vincelleo’s eyes swiveled back and forth. Revanche could see the tubes glowing, the switches clickclacking on the tremendous grey board inside that Greek temple of a forehead. But, he reflected, it was a temple that needed a whip to drive out the moneychangers.</p>
    <p>The Messinan made up his mind suddenly. “Done! I’ll get my lawyers, and we’ll make the transfer at once. I’ll conduct operations <emphasis>sub rosa.</emphasis> That’s best.”</p>
    <p>He sat down at his desk, and ran his fingers over several electronic “eyes” and said, “Your hometown is a free city, isn’t it?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, it has no contracts with the other cities. No alliances. It’s a non-coop all the way. It exists by its smug self-righteous little self!”</p>
    <p>“And it refuses to use modem day mechanisms. Right?”</p>
    <p>“Yes. It has reverted back to the horse-and-buggy days. Claims machines take the soul out of a man. Yet, and get this—here’s the irony of their set-up. Despising machinery, they’re still run by the most mechanical religion, and the most mechanical state, politically-speaking, imaginable. They think the devil invented the steam engine!</p>
    <p>“Yet, each soul in Dafess City is destined from birth to a certain rank in society. Destined to a certain job, a certain mate, and a certain place in Heaven! They’ve got a book which they call the Celestial Blueprint. It outlines the future in veiled, allegorical terms. But the Dafesses take every word literally, the letter being their spirit.”</p>
    <p>“Dafesses?” asked the artist, pretending ignorance.</p>
    <p>“After Multum Bonum Dafess, founder and prophet. Anyway, the Blueprint foretells the end of the world, when the inhabitants of Dafess will be saved, and the rest of the world will go to a nice little place reserved for them, called* Rejectus.</p>
    <p>“Rejectus is furnished with all the comforts of home—with hot water, baked meats, specially-built furniture, highly-trained personal attendants. You get me. Only the Dafesses, the Truncated, will be left untouched after the Day of Judgment. The Untruncated will go to Rejectus.”</p>
    <p>Da Vincelleo shifted uncomfortably in his chair. When he was a boy, his loving mother had described just such a place as his ultimate destination—if he didn’t mend his ways. And, though he had scoffed, his unconscious knew how to pitchfork certain uncalloused figments into his conscious mind.</p>
    <p>“You really hate them, don’t you?” he gibed.</p>
    <p>“I hate them because they’re so hateful,” Revanche replied. “You would, too, if you were destined to be looked down on all your life by people you knew were stupid. Or if you fell in love, and you were forbidden to marry because the girl wasn’t slated by the Elders to be your mate. Or if you were forced to marry some fat cow with the brains of a magpie because the Elders interpreted a certain passage in the Blueprint as referring to you.”</p>
    <p>His voice grew strained. “That’s not alii When I ran away, and made my pile, and could have any woman I wanted, I found I couldn’t endure any woman not from my hometown. Do you want to know why?” He touched his artificial nosetip, his voice soaring in a new scream.</p>
    <p>“I’ll tell you why! From infanthood, I was drilled in the idea that only women with truncated noses were pure, glorious, and beautiful. Until I ran away, I never saw a woman with a normal nose. Never! And now, even though I’ve disguised the mark of my native community, and know, rationally, that untruncated women <emphasis>are</emphasis> beautiful, my nerves, my stomach, won’t admit it. I think Miss Solar System of 2052 is ugly!</p>
    <p>“I could have her anytime, anywhere, understand? But I can’t endure her, or any of her sisters. They all look misshapen. And you know what, Da Vincelleo? Despite all my money, I can’t get a single beautiful woman in the System to cut off the tip of her nose for me. Not one! And I’ve met plenty who’ve said they loved me and would die for me. But they don’t love me enough to snip off the tips of their money-sniffing little noses. Oh, no!”</p>
    <p>For an instant, there was agony in his stare. “Just why do you think I’ve fought my way up until I’m sitting on top of Sol? So I can take it easy, and play golf or go staryacht-ing? Not B. T. Revanche!</p>
    <p>“It’s because I hate the guts of every soul in Dafess, every beakcut heaven-elected who won’t touch a machine because it might spot him with unholy oil, yet is himself a machine of the lowest type! I’m going to give them the most ironic justification of their creed.</p>
    <p>“Funny thing, though,” Revanche added, as if it were still puzzling him. “A <emphasis>statue</emphasis> of a beautiful woman without a truncated nose does seem to stir me a little. Like that one in the slogan corridor. It shows my basic instincts are still biologically normal.”</p>
    <p>Da Vincelleo sighed in mock sympathy and began running his fingers over the “eyes” that would summon the chiefs of his staffs. He knew that what he had in mind was going to be his masterwork. The secret excavation beneath Dafess would in itself tax his resources. As he blocked in the calls, his gaze fell upon a romantic historical novel on the desk before him, <emphasis>Renfrew Rides Again For The Mounted.</emphasis></p>
    <p>This novel, like many others written in the early 20th-century, had been taped and distributed Solarwide. The fad for viewing early Wild West movies had died out and been replaced by a passion for audiovisual recordings of romantic-historical novels. Of them all, Renfrew of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was the most prominent figure. So popular that the motto of the mounties—“We always get our man”—was on every body’s lips (usually in the form of a perverted joke).</p>
    <p>Da Vincelleo’s rocketing brain must have collided with a humorous thought, for his foxlike lips turned up even more. So Revanche wanted irony, did he? And poetic justice?</p>
    <p>He looked at the financier but Revanche failed to notice the smile. He was still raving.</p>

     <p><strong>III</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>Three months later, the noonday sun above Dafess City began dimming. In less than five minutes, it became a completely black ball and remained that somber and terrifying unnatural hue until it sank below the horizon.</p>
    <p>In due course, the stars rose in their appointed courses. But, suddenly, without warning, many fell, hurtling across the sky and disappearing into the bottomless throat of space.</p>
    <p>The full moon bounded up. Just as it cleared the horizon, it was struck by a large red star. Wounded, the moon dripped blood.</p>
    <p>All these signs were accompanied, outwardly, at least, by great rejoicing in Dafess. The Celestial Blueprint was fulfilling itself. The Time had come. The Truncated were about to get their just reward.</p>
    <p>They took baths for the first time in their lives. They put on immaculate white robes. Then, <emphasis>en masse,</emphasis> they marched to the great open square in the center of the city, and waited.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, all the Untruncated dwelling in Dafess had been cast out, and all intercourse with the outside had been cut off. Inasmuch as they used no radios, they had only to close the gates of their high-walled city to become incommunicado.</p>
    <p>As soon as that was done, and the citizens were collected together to receive their long prophesied payment for holiness, they turned their short snouts upward to await further developments. Nor were they at all disappointed.</p>
    <p>As predicted, the sky rolled up like a scroll. It did so with enough thunder to shake the bones and rattle the teeth of even the most hardened and secretly sceptical.</p>
    <p>With the thunder came a blaze of light which revealed a Titanic forge, a cosmic smithy where brawny angels with soot blackening their robes and smudging their halos stood beating plowshares into swords and spears.</p>
    <p>Flame leaped. Bellows pumped by a cherubic host wheezed like asthmatic Prometheuses. Hammers as large as hills clanged on white-hot weaponheads the size of skyscrapers held on anvils large as mountains. Fire and smoke puffed out in a great cloud that threatened to envelop the city. A clamor beat upon their ears and bounced from the heavens to the ground and back again.</p>
    <p>Then, the sky snapped shut. It clicked like a camera-eye, and the tremendous vision was gone.</p>
    <p>But the assembled Truncated were transported with joy. Had they not seen the swords prepared for the smiting of the heathen? All as foretold by the Celestial Blueprint?</p>
    <p>An exultant buzz rose from the crowd. It was, however, stilled at once, for, across the blackened sky, lightning flashed, and twisted itself into words that seared the eyes of the multitude. Everyone, watched spellbound above them.</p>
    <p>YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.</p>
    <p>A vast murmur of pleasure ascended from the crowd. Many of them looked relieved. They wiped sweat off their brows and glanced furtively at their companions to see if they had noticed the doubt on their faces.</p>
    <p>The Elders of the Truncated, gathered upon a raised platform in the center of the square, lifted their arms and began the ritual whose words would start the gears of the final minutes of the Day into spinning.</p>
    <p>As Blueprinted, the sky paled and became its normal afternoon azure. The citizens stood hushed, gazing expectantly upwards. After a tense two minutes, the sky suddenly turned black again. This time, however, streaks of blue appeared between the black clots. In a moment, it was seen that the sable hue had been caused by a host of figures, so many they had almost blotted out the blue.</p>
    <p>It was as if the sky were an upside-down sea out of which dived a thousand bodies, plunging earth-ward head foremost.</p>
    <p>A shout of rapture swelled from the ground to meet them. The dead Truncated were descending from Heaven to crown the faithful livingl</p>
    <p>But there was one man who did not scream with joy. He was B. T. Revanche, clad in a white robe and showing a nose from which the plastiflesh had been removed. He was there because he had insisted, to Da Vincelleo that he could not get his money’s worth unless he actually participated.</p>
    <p>“You can’t taste blood over a TV set,” he had growled.</p>
    <p>So it was that he was the only one of the throng who did not at the next moment fall silent in an amazed numbness. For the falling figures did not carry laurels with which to crown the faithful on the ground. Far from it. They held swords before them—long and broad two-edged blades that flashed ominously in the bright sunlight.</p>
    <p>A scream of mingled outrage and terror tore the air into tatters. Something was wrong! Somebody had thrown a monkey wrench into the celestial gears! The Blueprint had said nothing about this!</p>
    <p>The figures swelled in size as they came closer. They slowed their headlong rush, uprighted themselves, and floated feet first to earth. There they paused a minute, glaring about, until the entire army had descended.</p>
    <p>The multitude looked at the swordsmen, who were close enough to be discerned in detail. They breathed out one marveling and shocked syllable: “X!”</p>
    <p>Yes, each one of the thousands of descended beings was a replica of X, the entity known in other lands and other tongues by a thousand other names. X was one of his signs, and it was the one chosen by the prophet Dafess to designate the entity because X was an unknown quantity to the pagans.</p>
    <p>It was X, so wrote the prophet, who had visited Dafess in person and assured that man of wisdom that he alone was being given the monopoly of the sacred teachings. Nor did it matter to the prophet that hundreds of others had made prior claims. He, Dafess, was sure that only his descendants were to be X’s heirs on earth until such time as the entity returned.</p>
    <p>To prove it, they had marched into the wilderness and built this city and had then written a thousand books to bolster the tradition.</p>
    <p>"I will carry a sword,” X had promised.</p>
    <p>The Dafessians believed this, but they had been assured by their Elders, who were skilled in reading between the lines, that the swoi'd would be for the Untruncated. The peace would be the Truncateds’.</p>
    <p>Now X, as foretold, had returned to their city. He brought a sword, and if he also carried peace with him, it was a peace that passed understanding. And his name, in this place and time, had suddenly become Legion.</p>
    <p>Each one of the horde was X, but such an X as had never been dreamed of. He was eight feet tall and made of etemalloy over which plastiskin had been stretched to simulate flesh. So clever was the craftsmanship that only one who knew beforehand, like Revanche, that the creature was begotten in the factory could have told that here was not a living X.</p>
    <p>The artistry extended to the magnificent body, which had broad shoulders that tapered to slim hips and long, panthermuscled legs. The delicate feet were shod in brass.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>
     <p><strong>IV</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>Revanche, who was seeing for the first time the Messinan’s work, scrutinized with cynical elation the creature who had landed closest to him. Awed despite himself, he saw that a fast-whirling halo hovered perhaps a foot above the noble head. Every five seconds the luminous ring changed color.</p>
    <p>Even as he watched it, it changed color. From gold it dissolved into a bloody red, and then into a gangrenous green. Next it became a bruise purple, a witching hour black, and finally shifted back to gold.</p>
    <p>The aspect that startled Revanche most, however, was the face. The false flesh-mask stretched over the metal skull was a grotesque representation of the features of X as seen in the paintings of the Spanish and Italian masters.</p>
    <p>There was the somewhat narrow and bearded face with the “sensitive” full-lipped mouth and the gentle nose that poised between straightness and aquilinity. There were the same eyes—flowing and compassionate.</p>
    <p>But on the mask those conventional features had been slightly altered, or, as it were, “pulled.” Though the lips had been cast with meekness and love on their curves, the smile had been lengthened, and subtly twisted until it had passed over the boundary of a smile and became a snarl.</p>
    <p>Whatever fearsome hand had fashioned that mask had known that a snarl is an elongated smile, just as a smile is a modified snarl. The hand had perceived that it was the snarl of the ape that had become the smile of the man, perceived too that, the process of evolution continuing, the smile of the man had passed into the ultra-tender mouth-curving of X.</p>
    <p>And now, that smile which was the apex of Nature’s efforts, had been remolded, recast, rehammered, and returned into a caricature of itself.</p>
    <p>Da Vincelleo was not only a scientist, he was an artist supreme. In that mask, he had shown the people of Dafess a reflection of themselves. And he made them see what they had done to X, how they had twisted the face of universal love into an inverted image of their true nature—that of self-love.</p>
    <p>The mask was the face of <emphasis>X—reductio ad absurdum.</emphasis></p>
    <p>The gentle curve of nostrils had been expanded into derision and an almost savage fierceness. The glowing compassion of the eyes had become intense with a flame so hot it made the onlookers wonder how the lashes and brows resisted melting and running into the cavernous eyesockets.</p>
    <p>Yet, though fiery, the lineaments combined into a chilling sight. And, as there were thousands of the masks, they contributed to a geometrical progression of terror.</p>
    <p>Revanche, though he was safe, felt struck with fear and guilt that had been instilled into him when he was a child.</p>
    <p>At that moment, an Elder who had been eyeing the nearest X, afraid to go into the ritualistic embrace with it because of its fearsome aspect, suddenly ran to it. He threw himself at its feet, clasped its legs, and howled: “Mercy!”</p>
    <p>A deep powerful voice that sounded more like the roar of a motor than anything else answered, “Justice!”</p>
    <p>Justice was what the Elder had prayed for all of his life. Now he got it.</p>
    <p>The automaton lifted the sword and brought it down on the Elder’s chicken-skinny neck.</p>
    <p>“Chuck!” rasped the blade.</p>
    <p>“Bump!” replied the head.</p>
    <p>The white-bearded ball rolled on the pavement until it stopped against the curb. Upside down, it looked at everything from a new and possibly revelatory viewpoint, for its expression was not only bewildered and hurt but, for the first time, educated.</p>
    <p>Dafess City became bedlam, pandemonium, terror on a cataclysmic scale. The white body of the Truncated broke into fifty thousand fragments that fled here and there, circled, whirled, zigzagged, leaped, crawled, bounded, darted, and lunged.</p>
    <p>The legion of X stalked after them. They moved jerkily but swiftly. Above all, they moved relentlessly.</p>
    <p>When a cornered person could not get by the awesome figure, he or she would go down on his or her knees and clasp hands and howl, “Mercy! Mercy!”</p>
    <p>“Justice!” roared the immobile lips of the mask.</p>
    <p>“Slush!” smacked the lips of the blade.</p>
    <p>"Thud!” echoed the head.</p>
    <p>Though many skulls rolled, a more or less objective observer, such as Revanche, would have noticed that many more were spared.</p>
    <p>They were unharmed for a reason, however, for always the flailing swords forced the mob in a general direction.</p>
    <p>They were being herded towards the Temple of the Righteous, a truncated pyramid not far off the square. This pyramid also housed the First Dafess Sacred-Secular Bank and had grown to such proportions that it had crowded out the Finance Corporation. Peculiarly enough, the latter institution former and now occupied the center of the building. The Dafessians had accepted what seemed to them to be the will of X and had moved the holy section to one corner.</p>
    <p>Through the huge marble doors the multitude was forced. They had no place else to go, for, wherever they turned, the blazing eye and the flashing sword headed them off.</p>
    <p>B. T. Revanche allowed himself to be borne along with the current. Once inside the pyramid, however, he separated himself from the crowd and ran down a side-passage. The main body was being forced into the open door of the vault. He did not wish to go with them. He had persuaded Da Vincelleo to prepare a private entrance for him.</p>
    <p>He ran with all the speed his short legs could muster, puffing hard. When he rounded a comer, he stopped short. His heart, which had been pounding only moderately now suddenly went into the Walpurgisnacht terror music of Mous-sorgsky’s <emphasis>Night on Bald Mountain.</emphasis> A Bioid X was stationed down the hall, exactly in front of the mural that concealed the secret door!</p>
    <p>He paused, sucked in oxygen and courage, and then walked briskly up to the thing, confident that the electronic “in-terferer” he wore strapped to his belt would neutralize it.</p>
    <p>But, when he got up to it, his suppressed doubt and suspicion were translated into action. The flame-eyed X lifted its sword, and lashed out at him.</p>
    <p>“You have been chosen!” the frozen lips roared.</p>
    <p>The keen tip missed by a spiderweb taking Revanche’s Adam’s apple out in one neat chunk.</p>
    <p>Appalled, the financier turned and fled.</p>
    <p>While he ran, he turned his head and shrilled back, “You are making a mistake!” It was a futile thing to scream out, for the plastiskin ears were deaf, to meaning, if not to noise.</p>
    <p>Revanche’s hand fumbled on the interferer’s switch, and clicked it back and forth. It seemed to be working; it was warm and humming. What then was the matter?</p>
    <p>He cursed Da Vincelleo for a strictly third-rate artisan—a bungler, botcher, and bonehead.</p>
    <p>Suddenly he was running down another empty corridor, his hard soles bouncing echoes off the faraway walls. S<emphasis>lap! Slap! Puff! Wheeze!</emphasis> There was an open window at the distant end of the hall. If only he could make that. ... 1</p>
    <p>Again, he stopped short. Half hidden in the shadows stood an X on guard. It turned its head, and tiger-bright eyes flamed.</p>
    <p>Revanche choked off a scream and whirled. He expected to see the other destroyer behind him, but it was not in sight. When he reached the junction of the two corridors, he saw it standing there, sword held out before it in satiric salute.</p>
    <p>There was but one way for Revanche to go—straight back to the bank’s vault.</p>
    <p>For the first time he realized that he himself, B. T. Revanche, was being herdedl</p>
    <p>He spun around again to face the oncoming terrors. Frantically, his fingers flicked the switch.</p>
    <p>“Stopl Stopl I am your master! I am Revanche! I own you!”</p>
    <p>“You are the chosen!” they bellowed.</p>
    <p>He whirled, and began running again.</p>
    <p>When he reached the vault, he found the X’s lined up in a double row, like the guards at a royal reception. They stood facing each other with eyes blazing at eyes, swords held straight out before them and legs widespread above gleaming shoes of brass.</p>
    <p>Revanche did not stop but sped down between the guard of honor as if he were afraid they would all begin chopping at once. He had a vision of tiny fragments of meat swimming in a pool of blood, like protozoa jerking in a drop of water beneath a microscope.</p>
    <p>When he came to the huge steel door of the vault, he stopped and looked within. The floor immediately before him had raised up to form a wall. Benath it was a round hole, the entrance to a large metallic, and greasy tube.</p>
    <p>Down that funnel had slid the entire population, screaming, wailing, weeping, clutching at one another for support, striking out in a burst of maniacal fury.</p>
    <p>Down they had gone notwithstanding, with a gnashing of teeth and tongues, and frantic clawings at the smooth and slippery sides in a desperate attempt to keep from hurtling to the doom they knew awaited them.</p>
    <p>How well they knew it! This tube was exactly that which had been foretold in the Celestial Blueprint as the passageway for the heathen when they fell headlong to Rejectus!</p>
    <p>Revanche had planned to slip down his private stairway to the little balcony that would overlook the other end of the tube. There, he would have watched the doomed spilling out in a white and frenzied flood. There, he would have lapped up revenge as a Greek ghost would have lapped blood at a Trojan hecatomb.</p>
    <p>Instead, trembling, and bursting with terror, he turned and faced the X’s. “You haven’t got me yeti” he screamed at them.</p>
    <p>He kicked the little wheel that closed the vault from the inside. Once the two hundred ton door clanged shut, it could not be opened as long as the inside wheel remained locked in place. It was an antirobbery device that he was well aware of, having in his youth once planned to plunder the bank in order to get a start in business.</p>
    <p>The huge door swung shut swiftly.</p>
    <p>Revanche shook his fist at the onrushing horde, then jerked around, and leaped into the tube. The thunder of brass shoes filled the vault walls. Just before he slid out of view, Revanche twisted his head for one last look.</p>
    <p>A Bioid was leaping through the air in a desperate endeavor to sacrifice itself by stopping the door with its hard and almost indestructible eternalloy body.</p>
    <p>The financier did not see whether or not the Bioid made it, for he dropped abrutly into blackness.</p>

    </title>
    <p>Normally, he would have shot down the smooth funnel, inclined at thirty-five degrees, at a terrific speed. But he had not become the most resourceful financier of the solar system for nothing.</p>
    <p>So it was that he flicked the switch of the antigrav unit around his waist and quickly slowed to a half-speed. He had wanted to wear a full power machine, but it would have been too bulky to conceal beneath the loose folds of his garments. He had to be content with a moderate rate of descent.</p>
    <p>After twenty seconds of sliding, he slipped out of the mouth of the funnel. It was as he had hoped. His checked speed enabled him to drop onto a granite ledge beneath the opening. Even so, he fell close to the very edge. A little more velocity, and he would have gone completely over.</p>
    <p>Shuddering, he clutched the rim of rock until he’d regained some of his composure. After a while, he inched forward until his head hung over the lip of the precipice, and he could gaze downward into the abyss.</p>
    <p>Below, seemingly a thousand feet down, though he knew the distance must be an illusion fabricated by Da Vincelleo, was a lake of molten lava rising in great billows, then sinking into deep valleys, and releasing gigantic bubbles that rose and burst, and loosed a stench of sulfur that almost suffocated him. Smoke spiralled up past his head, and collected against the roof far above. The heat that ascended was strong enough to crisp his face if he had looked long into it.</p>
    <p>Nowhere was there a sign of Dafess’s inhabitants. All had been dissolved in the roaring sea of lava, in the hell that had been prophesied for all their enemies.</p>
    <p>Quailing, Revanche looked to left and right along the narrow ledge for an avenue of escape. There was none. Both ends tapered off into the rock.</p>
    <p>Straight across, perhaps a hundred feet away, was the balcony from which he had hoped to see the show. If he had the guts, he thought, he could step up his antigrav past the danger point and, almost weightless for a second, could leap to the balcony.</p>
    <p>If the pack didn’t bum out while he was in midair. If he didn’t misgauge and miss the balcony ... if the hellish blast from below didn’t crisp him before he completed the jump . . . if . . .</p>
    <p>He stood up, and by the glow thrown up from the bright ocean, he peered up the slide. Another <emphasis>if.</emphasis> What if he could brace his legs against the sides of the <emphasis>O,</emphasis> and painfully work his way back up?</p>
    <p>At that moment, a figure shot out of the shadows of the tunnel, a figure that approached at express-train speed and quickly loomed larger and larger. Its blood-colored halo, the mask with the snarl of tenderness, the furnace-door eyes, and the dripping sword—all could be made out in frightening detail.</p>
    <p>Like the lost soul he believed he was, Revanche screamed and dropped flat to the ledge, crushing his snipped nose into the granite. He moaned and waited for the clang of armor and the final whistle of the blade through the air before it thudded into his neck.</p>
    <p>Above him, something dark and monstrous shot out of the O and roared by.</p>
    <p>Whooshl</p>
    <p>It missed the ledge by many feet and fell into the lava ocean.</p>
    <p>A train of shadows flickered over Revanche. The air was disturbed by the constant passage of flying elephantine bodies.</p>
    <p>Whoosh!</p>
    <p>Whoosh!</p>
    <p>Whoosh!</p>
    <p>One by one, like living shells exploded out of a circus cannon, they projectiled over their intended prey. By the thousands, they meteored over him, eyeballs matching the glare of the lava below, swords automatically slashing out even as they spun and turned over and over, and splashed into the liquid rock.</p>
    <p>Whish! Brrr! Whoosh! Splash!</p>
    <p>Suddenly—silence.</p>
    <p>Slowly, Revanche rose. He could not believe it. He looked over the ledge. Only the bare and boiling sea. He turned and glanced up the tube. Silence and shadows and the gleaming greasy symbol for zero.</p>
    <p>Understanding melted the glacier on his brain. He broke into a wild dance, wept tears for gladness, whistled three times, and shouted, “I’ve won! Revanche has won! And I’ve beat them!”</p>
    <p><emphasis>Clippety-clop! Clippety-clop!</emphasis></p>
    <p>The unbelievable ring of iron horseshoes jumped out of the tub’s mouth.</p>
    <p>Revanche froze in a pirouette, stood poised, then seemed to collapse into a strange loose creature that shambled over to the funnel and leaned backward to look up, like a dazed and stiffnecked Neanderthal.</p>
    <p>The liquid film of joy glazed over his mind again, grew white and cold and lumpy.</p>
    <p>A mount and its rider were coming out of the darkness and into the brimstone glare. The horse was a nightmare black, its eyeballs burning tiger-yellow bright. It stretched back cruel and foaming lips, and revealed teeth sharp enough to rend him.</p>
    <p>A ghost horse, it cried for blood while its magnetic shoes clung briefly to the metal floor before lifting again.</p>
    <p><emphasis>Clippety-clop</emphasis> rang its hooves.</p>
    <p>Then, it stopped and hung its head down over the tube’s lip and fixed Revanche with one demon’s eye while its rider dismounted. It remained in that attitude, and did not move even when its master dropped gently onto the ledge to face Revanche.</p>
    <p>The financier felt his bulging eyes threaten to leave his head, like balloons tugging at their moorings.</p>
    <p>His eyes understood before his brain did.</p>
    <p>They took in a face that was a compound of two persons, a masterly paradox of features and traits: compassionate and merciless, sensitive and coarse, loving and hating. It was a hybrid of X and of <emphasis>himself</emphasis>.</p>
    <p>It was not that contradictory face that told him so much, that explained why his interferer had failed to work, even why he had been “herded,” and was now facing this fantastic and vengeful creation.</p>
    <p>It was something else that told him that not only Dafess City but he, Revanche, had been the victim of a Caligulan sense of humor, the butt of the most colossal practical joke the Messinan had ever played.</p>
    <p>That something else he had been too shocked to think about. Why had the Bioids, who carried full-power antigravs within their bodies, fallen over the ledge? It was because Da Vincelleo had deliberately destroyed them to raise his hopes. And then had brought out this—this thing—this <emphasis>joke!</emphasis> Not satisfied to make Revanche squirm, he had wanted him to sweat blood.</p>
    <p>The creature that was drawing a saber from its scabbard was dressed in a uniform now long dead but easily recognizable because it had been resurrected recently in many of the romantic historical novels that enjoyed a Solarwide vogue.</p>
    <p>“The Royal Canadian Mounted Police always gets its manl” roared the mask between the stiff Stetson and scarlet jacket. “Renfrew is never foiled; Renfrew tracks until the criminal reaches the end of the long long trail! And you, Monsieur Revanche, you must pay for your crimes!”</p>
    <p>Revanche fell to his knees.</p>
    <p>“Mercy!”</p>
    <p>Its saber lifted. The immobile lips roared.</p>
    <p>“Justice!”</p>
   </section>

    <title>
     <p>EPILOGUE</p>
    </title>
    <p>Da Vincelleo, hovering far above Dafess in a spaceship, watched the final scene upon the TV screen before him. Then, sighing because it hurt him to destroy his greatest work of art, he pressed a red button. And he saw the city of Dafess disappear in the old and familiar, but still terrible, mushroom.</p>
    <p>“That fool Revanche!” he said. “Did he really think I’d massacre an entire city and take a million to one chance of escaping retribution from the Solar Police?”</p>
    <p>He did not think of his being punished for such a deed as being justice. Anything he did was right; retaliation from others would have been vengeance, not justice.</p>
    <p>He sighed again. The Project: Dafess, had been enormous. But the worst problem had been Dafess's citizens themselves. Even while an exact replica of the city was being constructed in a Canadian wilderness, far from the real Dafess, his staff was tackling the necessary research, of which the hardest part had been both historical and technological. One, finding out exactly what each citizen looked and acted and talked like. Two, building Bioids that looked, acted, and talked like the original.</p>
    <p>Of course, the whole illusion had been designed to fool only one man and had had to be kept in existence less than ten hours.</p>
    <p>A minor, though fascinating problem had been that of getting blood to spout from the severed heads and concealing the springs and wires inside the wrecked bodies.</p>
    <p>At that moment, Revanche, very much alive in his star yacht poised just above the stratosphere, pressed a button. The screen on his desk showed him a blur that was the missile he’d just launched at the target, Da Vincelleo’s ship. Then, there was incandescence, followed by the old familiar mushroom.</p>
    <p>Revanche growled, “That fool!” and he turned away from the screen. His face was smug as a porcupine’s that has loaded up on tender and vitamin rich birchbark. He felt exceedingly satisfied. Why not? Watching the destruction of the synthetic citizens of the synthetic city of Dafess had been almost as rewarding as seeing the real city delivered to judgment. The process had been a type of psycho-drama that any psychiatrist would have recommended for emotional catharsis.</p>
    <p>For the financier trusted no man, and, though Da Vincelleo had thought his double-crossing project was a secret, he could not hide it from the richest and most inquisitive human in the system. Nor had he guessed that Revanche would then employ Bioid’s competitor to fashion an electronic proxy of himself.</p>
    <p>Revanche had suffered—long distance—as his plastiskin counterpart had seemed to suffer. It’s terror-stricken face was his, and when it had yelled with frustration and screamed for mercy, he had done so also.</p>
    <p>But when he saw the terrible parody of himself lop off his proxy’s head with a saber, he had felt as if he’d been killed and then come to life again.</p>
    <p>He’d been seized with a laughter that forced him to grip his chair to keep from falling to the floor. And now, very much calmed and smoking a new cigar, he felt wonderful about his mockup’s death.</p>
    <p>He no longer had a barely suppressed fear of being hurled by his deity into the molten ocean of Rejectus. It was as if he had paid for his own sins through the mechanical scapegoat and now could live on with an untroubled conscience.</p>
    <p>He took the cigar from his mouth and chortled.</p>
    <p>And a third mushroom suddenly sprouted.</p>
    <p>Revanche and his star yacht went back to the elements in its white heart, far hotter than the flames of Rejectus.</p>
    <p>Da Vincelleo had been a thorough man, as suspicious as Revanche himself. Shortly after he had made his deal with the financier, he had had equipment built which keyed in to the personal pattern of his <emphasis>kappa</emphasis> brain-waves. If that pattern disappeared, quit radiating, a circuit was activated which sent a “blood-hound” missile soaring up into the air from a buried pit in the city of Messina, a missile whose electromagnetic nose sniffed for the scent of Revanche’s <emphasis>kappa</emphasis> brainwaves and would not stop until it homed in on its target.</p>
    <p>Thus, if the financier had paused long enough to light up his cigar <emphasis>before</emphasis> pressing the button that disposed of his enemy, he would have finished smoking it and many more after it.</p>
    <p>For Da Vincelleo had been convinced that Revanche had perished with the false city of Dafess, and he was just reaching out to flick the bloodhound’s deactivation stud when Revanche’s missile interrupted him forever.</p>

    <empty-line/>
    <p>Jack Crane lay all morning in the vacant lot. Now and then, he moved a little to quiet the protest of cramped muscles and stagnant blood, but most of the time he was as motionless as the heap of rags he resembled. Not once did he hear or see a Bohas agent, or, for that matter, anyone. The predawn darkness had hidden his panting flight from the transie jungle, his dodging across backyards while whistles shrilled and voices shouted, and his crawling on hands and knees down an alley into the high grass and bushes which fringed a hidden garden.</p>
    <p>For a while, his heart had knocked so loudly that he had been sure he would not be able to hear his pursuers if they did get close. It seemed inevitable that they would track him down. A buddy had told him that a new camp had just been built at a place only three hours drive away from the town. This meant that Bohas would be thick as hornets in the neighborhood. But no black uniforms had so far appeared. And then, lying there while the passionate and untiring sun mounted the sky, the bang-bang of his heart was replaced by a noiseless but painful movement in his stomach.</p>
    <p>He munched a candy bar and two dried rolls which a housewife had given him the evening before. The tiger in his belly quit pacing back and forth; it crouched and licked its chops, but its tail was stuck up in his throat. Jack could feel the dry fur swabbing his pharynx and mouth. He suffered, but he was used to that. Night would come as surely as anything did. He’d get a drink then to quench his thirst.</p>
    <p>Boredom began to sit on his eyelids. Just as he was about to accept some much needed sleep, he moved a leaf with an accidental jerk of his hand and uncovered a caterpillar. It was dark except for a row of yellow spots along the central line of some of its segments. As soon as it was exposed, it began slowly shimmying away. Before it had gone two feet, it was crossed by a moving shadow. Guiding the shadow was a black wasp with an orange ring around the abdomen. It closed the gap between itself and the worm with a swift, smooth movement and straddled the dark body.</p>
    <p>Before the wasp could grasp the thick neck with its mandibles, the intended victim began rapidly rolling and unrolling and flinging itself from side to side. For a minute, the delicate dancer above it could not succeed in clenching the neck. Its sharp jaws slid off the frenziedly jerking skin until the tiring creature paused for the chip of a second.</p>
    <p>Seizing opportunity and larva at the same time, the wasp stood high on its legs and pulled the worm’s front end from the ground, exposing the yellowed band of the underpart. The attacker’s abdomen curved beneath its own body; the stinger jabbed between two segments of the prey’s jointed length. Instantly, the writhing stilled. A shudder, and the caterpillar became as inert as if it were dead.</p>
    <p>Jack had watched with an eye not completely clinical, feeling the sympathy of the hunted and the hounded for a fellow. His own struggles of the past few months had been as desperate, though not as hopeless, and . . .</p>
    <p>He stopped thinking. His heart again took up the rib-thudding. Out of the comer of his left eye he had seen a shadow that fell across the garden. When he slowly turned his head to follow the stain upon the sun-splashed soil, he saw that it clung to a pair of shining black boots.</p>
    <p>Jack did not say anything. What was the use? He put his hands against the weeds and pushed his body up. He looked into the silent mouth of a .38 automatic. It told him his running days were over. You didn’t talk back to a mouth like that.</p>

     <p><strong>II</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>Jack was lucky. As one of the last to be herded into the truck, which had been once used for hauling cattle, he had more room to breathe than most of the others. He faced the rear bars. The vehicle was heading into the sun. Its rays were not as hard on him as on some of those who were so jam-packed they could not turn to get the hot yellow splotch out of their eyes.</p>
    <p>He looked through lowered lids at the youths on either side of him. For the last three days in the transie jungle, the one standing on his left had given signs of what was coming upon him, what had come upon so many of the transies. The muttering, the indifference to food, not hearing you when you talked to him. And now the shock of being caught in the raid had speeded up what everybody had foreseen. He was hardened, like a concrete statue, into a halfcrouch. His arms were held in front of him like a praying mantis’, and his hands clutched a bar. Not even the pressure of the crowd could break his posture.</p>
    <p>The man on Jack’s right murmured something, but the roaring of motor and clashing of gears shifting on a hill squashed his voice. He spoke louder, <emphasis>“Cerea flexibilitas.</emphasis> Extreme catatonic state. The fate of all of us.”</p>
    <p>“You’re nuts,” said Jack. “Not me. I’m no schizo, and I’m not going to become one.”</p>
    <p>As there was no reply, Jack decided he had not moved his lips enough to be heard clearly. Lately, even when it was quiet, people seemed to have trouble making out what he was saying. It made him mildly angry.</p>
    <p>He shouted. It did not matter if he were overheard. That any of the prisoners were agents of the Bureau of Health and Sanity didn’t seem likely. Anyway, he didn’t care. They wouldn’t do anything to him they hadn’t planned before this.</p>
    <p>“Got any idea where we’re going?”</p>
    <p>“Sure. F.M.R.C. 3. Federal Male Rehabilitation Camp No. 3. I spent two weeks in the hills spying on it.”</p>
    <p>Jack looked the speaker over. Like all those in the truck, he wore a frayed shirt, a stained and tom coat, and greasy, dirty trousers. The black bristles on his face were long; the back of his neck was covered by thick curls. The brim of his dusty hat was pulled down low. Beneath its shadow, his eyes roamed from side to side with the same fear that Jack knew was in his own eyes.</p>
    <p>Hunger and sleepless nights had knobbed his cheekbones and honed his chin to a sharp point. An almost visible air clung to him, a hot aura that seemed to result from veins full of lava and eyeballs spilling out a heat that could not be held within him. He had the face of every transie, the face of a man who was either burning with fever or who had seen a vision.</p>
    <p>Jack looked away to stare miserably at the dust boiling up behind the wheels, as if he could see projected against its yellow-brown screen his retreating past.</p>
    <p>He spoke out of the side of his mouth. “What’s happened to us? We should be happy and working at good jobs and sure about the future. We shouldn’t be just bums, hobos, walkers of the streets, rod-hoppers, beggars, and thieves.”</p>
    <p>His friend shrugged and looked uneasily from the comers of his eyes. He was probably expecting the question they all asked sooner or later: <emphasis>Why are</emphasis> you <emphasis>on the road?</emphasis> They asked, but none replied with words that meant anything. They lied, and they didn’t seem to take any pleasure in their lying. When they asked questions themselves, they knew they would not get the truth. But something forced them to keep on trying anyway.</p>
    <p>Jack’s buddy evaded also. He said, “I read a magazine article by a Dr. Vespa, the head of the Bureau of Health and Sanity. He’d written the article just after the President created the Bureau. He viewed, quote, with alarm and apprehension, unquote, the fact that six percent of those between the ages of twelve and twenty-five are schizophrenics who need institutionalizing. And he was, quote, appalled and horrified, unquote, that five percent of the nation are homeless unemployed and that three point seven percent of those are between the ages of fourteen and thirty. He said that if this schizophrenia kept on progressing, half the world would be in rehabilitation camps. But if that occurred, the sane half would go to pot. Back to the stone age. And the schizos would die.”</p>
    <p>He licked his lips as if he were tasting the figures and found them bitter.</p>
    <p>“I was very interested by Vespa’s reply to a mother who had written him,” he went on. “Her daughter ended up in a Bohas camp for schizos, and her son had left his wonderful home and brilliant future to become a bum. She wanted to know why. Vespa took six long paragraphs to give six explanations, all equally valid and all advanced by equally distinguished sociologists. He himself favored the mass hysteria theory. But if you looked at his gobbledegook closely, you could reduce it to one phrase, <emphasis>We don’t know.</emphasis></p>
    <p>“He did say this—though you won’t like it—that the schizos and the transies were just two sides of the same coin. Both were infected with the same disease, whatever it was And the transies usually ended up as schizos anyway. It just took them longer.”</p>
    <p>Gears shifted. The floor slanted. Jack was shoved hard against the rear boards by the weight of the other men. He didn’t answer until the pressure had eased and his ribs were free to work for more than mere survival.</p>
    <p>He said, “You’re way off, schizo. My hitting the road has nothing to do with those splitheads. Nothing, you understand? There’s nothing foggy or dreamy about me. I wouldn’t be here with you guys if I hadn’t been so interested in a wasp catching a caterpillar that I never saw the Bohas sneaking up on me."</p>
    <p>While Jack described the little tragedy, the other allowed an understanding smile to bend his lips. He seemed engrossed, however, and when Jack had finished, he said:</p>
    <p>“That was probably an ammophila wasp. <emphasis>Sphex umaria</emphasis> Klug. Lovely but vicious little she-demon. Injects the poison from her sting into the caterpillar’s central nerve cord. That not only paralyzes but preserves it. The victim is always stowed away with another one in an underground burrow. The wasp attaches one of her eggs to the body of a worm. When the egg hatches, the grub eats both of the worms. They’re alive, but they’re completely helpless to resist while their guts are gnawed away. Beautiful idea, isn’t it?</p>
    <p>“It’s a habit common to many of those little devils: <emphasis>Sceli-phron cementarvum, Eumenes, coarcta, Eumenes fratema, Bembix spinolae, Pelopoeus</emphasis> . . .”</p>
    <p>Jack’s interest wandered. His informant was evidently one of those transies who spent long hours in the libraries. They were ready at the slightest chance to offer their encyclopaedic but often useless knowledge. Jack himself had abandoned his childhood bookwormishness. For the last three years his days and evenings had worn themselves out on the streets, passed in a parade of faces, flickered by in plateglass windows of restaurants and department stores and business offices, while he hoped, hoped. . . .</p>
    <p>“Did you say you spied on the camp?” Jack interrupted the sonorous, almost chanting flow of Greek and Latin.</p>
    <p>“Huh? Oh, yeah. For two weeks. I saw plenty of transies trucked in, but I never saw any taken out. Maybe they left in the rocket.”</p>
    <p>“Rocket?”</p>
    <p>The youth was looking straight before him. His face was hard as bone, but his voice trembled.</p>
    <p>“Yes. A big one. It landed and discharged about a dozen men.”</p>
    <p>“You nuts?”</p>
    <p>“I saw it, I tell you. And I’m not so nutty I’m seeing things that aren’t there. Not yet, anywayl”</p>
    <p>“Maybe the government’s got rockets it’s not telling anybody about.”</p>
    <p>“Then what connection could there be between rehabilitation camps and rockets?”</p>
    <p>Jack shrugged and said, “Your rocket story is fantastic.” “If somebody had told you four years ago that you’d be a bum hauled off to a concentration camp, you’d have said that was fantastic too.”</p>
    <p>Jack did not have time to reply. The truck stopped outside a high, barbed wire fence. The gate swung open; the truck bounced down the bumpy dirt road. Jack saw some black-uniformed Bohas seated by heavy machine guns. They halted at another entrance; more barbed wire was passed. Huge Dobermann-Pinchers looked at the transies with cold, steady eyes. The dust of another section of road swirled up before they squeaked to a standstill and the engine turned off.</p>
    <p>This time, agents began to let down the back of the truck. They had to pry the pitiful schizo’s fingers loose from the wood with a crow-bar and carry him off, still in his halfcrouch.</p>
    <p>A sergeant boomed orders. Stiff and stumbling, the transies jumped off the truck. They were swiftly lined up into squads and marched into the enclosure and from there into a huge black barracks. Within an hour each man was stripped; had his head shaven, was showered, given a grey uniform, and handed a tin plate and spoon and cup filled with beans and bread and hot coffee.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, Jack wandered around, free to look at the sandy soil underfoot and barbed wire and the black uniforms of the sentries, and free to ask himself where, where, where-wherewhere? Twelve years ago it had been, but where, where, where, was . . . ?</p>

     <p><strong>III</strong></p>
    </title>
    <p>How easy it would have been to miss all this, if only he had obeyed his father. But Mr. Crane was so ineffectual. . . .</p>
    <p>“Jack,” he had said, “would you please go outside and play, or stay in some other room. It’s very difficult to discuss business while, you're whooping and screaming around, and I have a lot to discuss with Mr.—”</p>
    <p>“Yes, Daddy,” Jack said before his father mentioned his visitor’s name. But he was not Jack Crane in his game; he was Uncas. The big chairs and the divan were trees in his imaginative eyes. The huge easy chair in which .Daddy’s caller (Jack thought of him only as “Mister”) sat was a fallen log. He, Uncas, meant to hide behind it in ambush.</p>
    <p>Mister did not bother him. He had smiled and said in a shrill voice that he thought Jack was a very nice boy. He wore a light grey-green Palm Beach suit and carried a big brown leather briefcase that looked too heavy for his soda straw-thin legs and arms. He was queer looking because his waist was so narrow and his back so humped. And when he took off his tan Panama hat, a white fuzz exploded from his scalp. His face was pale as the moon in daylight. His broad smile showed teeth that Jack knew were false.</p>
    <p>But the queerest thing about him was his thick spectacles, so heavily tinted with rose that Jack could not see the eyes behind them. The afternoon light seemed to bounce off the lenses in such a manner that no matter what angle you looked at them, you could not pierce them. And they curved to hide the sides of his eyes completely.</p>
    <p>Mister had explained that he was an albino, and he needed the glasses to dim the glare on his eyes. Jack stopped being Uncas for a minute to listen. He had never seen an albino before, and, indeed, he did not know what one was.</p>
    <p>“I don’t mind the youngster,” said Mister. “Let him play here if he wants to. He’s developing his imagination, and he may be finding more stimuli in this front room than he could in all of outdoors. We should never cripple the fine gift of imagination in the young. Imagination, fancy, fantasy—or whatever you call it—is the essence and mainspring of those scientists, musicians, painters, and poets who amount to something in later life. They are adults who have remained youths.”</p>
    <p>Mister addressed Jack, “You’re the Last of the Mohicans, and you’re about to sneak up on the French captain and tomahawk him, aren’t you?”</p>
    <p>Jack blinked. He nodded his head. The opaque rose lenses set in Mister’s face seemed to open a door into his naked grey skull.</p>
    <p>The man said, “I want you to listen to me, Jack. You’ll forget my name, which isn’t important. But you will always remember me and my visit, won’t you?”</p>
    <p>Jack stared at the impenetrable lenses and nodded dumbly. Mister turned to Jack’s father. “Let his fancy grow. It is a necessary wish-fulfillment play. Like all human young who are good for anything at all, he is trying to find the lost door to the Garden of Eden. The history of the great poets and men-of-action is the history of the attempt to return to the realm that Adam lost, the forgotten Hesperides of the mind, the Avalon buried in our soul.”</p>
    <p>Mr. Crane put his fingertips together. “Yes?”</p>
    <p>“Personally, I think that-some day man will realize just what he is searching for and will invent a machine that will enable the child to project, just as a film throws an image on a screen, the visions in his psyche.</p>
    <p>“I see you’re interested,” he continued. “You would be, naturally, since you’re a professor of philosophy. Now, let’s call the toy a specterscope, because through it the subject sees the spectres that haunt his unconscious. Hal Hal But how does it work? I’ll tell you. My native country’s scientists have developed a rather simple device, though they haven’t published anything about it in the scientific journals. Let me give you a brief explanation: Light strikes the retina of the eye; the rods and cones pass on impulses to the bipolar cells, which send them on to the optic nerve, which goes to the brain . . .”</p>
    <p>“Elementary and full of gaps,” said Jack’s father.</p>
    <p>"Pardon me,” said Mister. “A bare outline should be enough. You’ll be able to fill in the details. Very well. This specterscope breaks up the light going into the eye in such a manner that the rods and cones receive only a certain wavelength. I can’t tell you what it is, except that it’s in the visual red. The scope also concentrates like a burning-glass and magnifies the power of the light.</p>
    <p>“Result? A hitherto-undiscovered chemical in the visual purple of the rods is activated and stimulates the optic nerve in a way he had not guessed possible. An electrochemical stimulus then irritates the subconscious until it fully wakes up.</p>
    <p>“Let me put it this way. The subconscious is not a matter of <emphasis>location</emphasis> but of <emphasis>organization.</emphasis> There are billions of possible connections between the neurons of the cortex. Look at those potentialities as so many cards in the same pack. Shuffle the cards one way and you have the common workaday <emphasis>cogito, ergo sum</emphasis> mind. Reshuffle them, and, bingol you have the combination of neurons, or cards, of the unconscious. The specterscope does the redealing. When the subject gazes through it, he sees for the first time the full impact and result of his underground mind’s workings in other perceptics than dreams or symbolical behavior. The subjective Garden of Eden is resurrected. It is my contention that this specterscope will some day be available to all children.</p>
    <p>“When that happens, Mr. Crane, you will understand that the world will profit from man’s secret wishes. Earth will be a far better place. Paradise, sunken deep in every man, can be dredged out.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know,” said Jack’s father, stroking his chin thoughtfully with a finger. “Children like my son are too introverted as it is. Give them this psychological toy, and you would watch them grow, not into the outside world, but into themselves. They would fester. Man has been expelled from the Garden. His history is a long, painful climb toward something different. It is something that is probably better than the soft and flabby Golden Age. If man were to return, he would regress, become worse than static, become infantile or even embryonic. He would be smothered in the folds of his own dreams.”</p>
    <p>“Perhaps,” said the salesman. “But I think you have a very unusual child here. He will go much farther than you may think. Why? Because he is sensitive and has an imagination that only needs the proper guidance. Too many children become mere ciphers and paunches and round “O” minds full of tripe. They’ll stay on earth. That is, I mean they’ll be stuck in the mud.”</p>
    <p>“You talk like no insurance salesman I’ve ever met.”</p>
    <p>“Like all those who really want to sell, I’m a born psychologist,” Mister shrilled. “Actually, I have an advantage. I have a Ph.D. in psychology. I would prefer staying at home for laboratory work, but since I can help my starving children— I am not joking—so much more by coming to a foreign land and working at something that will put food in their mouths, I do it. I can’t stand to see my little ones go hungry. Moreover,” he said with a wave of his long-fingered hand, “this whole planet is really a lab that beats anything within four walls.”</p>
    <p>“You spoke of famine. Your accent—your name. You’re a Greek, aren’t you?”</p>
    <p>“In a way,” said Mister. “My name, translated, means gracious or kindly or well-meaing.” His voice became brisker. “The translation is apropos. I’m here to do you a service. Now, about these monthly premiums . . .”</p>
    <p>Jack shook himself and stepped out of the mold of fascination that Mister’s glasses seemed to have poured around him. Uncas again, he crawled on all fours from chair to divan to stool to the fallen log which the adults thought was an easy chair. He stuck his head from behind it and sighted along the broomstick-musket at his father. He’d shoot that white man dead and then take his scalp. He giggled at that, because his father really didn’t have any hairlock to take.</p>
    <p>At that moment, Mister decided to take off his specs and polish them with his breastpocket handkerchief. While he answered one of Mr. Crane’s questions, he let them dangle from his fingers. The lenses were level with Jack’s gaze. One careless glance was enough to jerk his eyes back to them. One glance stunned him so that he could not at once understand that what he was seeing was not reality.</p>
    <p>There was his father across the room. But it wasn’t a room. It was a space outdoors under the low branch of a tree whose trunk was so big it was as wide as the wall had been. Nor was the Persian rug there. It was replaced by a close-cropped bright green grass. Here and there foot-high flowers with bright yellow petals tipped in scarlet swayed beneath an internal wind. Close to Mr. Crane’s feet a white horse no larger than a fox terrier bit off the flaming end of a plant.</p>
    <p>All those things were wonderful enough—but was that naked giant who sprawled upon a moss-covered boulder his father? No! Yes! Though the features were no longer pinched and scored and pale, though they were glowing and tanned and smooth like a young athlete’s they were his father’s! Even the thick, curly hair that fell down over a wide forehead and the panther-muscled body could not hide his identity.</p>
    <p>Though it tore at his nerves, and though he was afraid that once he looked away he would never again seize the vision, Jack ripped his gaze away from the rosy view.</p>
    <p>The descent to the grey and rasping reality was so painful that tears ran down his cheeks, and he gasped as if struck in the pit of the stomach. How could beauty like that be all around him without his knowing it?</p>
    <p>He felt that he had been blind all his life until this moment and would be forever eyeless again, an unbearable forever, if he did not look through the glass again.</p>
    <p>He stole another hurried glance, and the pain in his heart and stomach went away, his insides became wrapped in a soft wind. He was lifted. He was floating, a pale red, velvety air caressed him and buoyed him.</p>
    <p>He saw his mother run from around the tree. That should have seemed peculiar, because he had thought she was dead. But there she was, no longer flat-walking and coughing and thin and wax-skinned but golden-brown and curvy and bouncy. She jumped at Daddy and gave him a long kiss. Daddy didn’t seem to mind that she had no clothes on. Oh, it was so wonderful. Jack was drifting on a yielding and wine-tinted air and warmed with a wind that seemed to swell him out like a happy balloon. . . .</p>
    <p>Suddenly he was falling, hurtling helplessly and sickeningly through a void while a cold and drab blast gouged his skin and spun him around and around. The world he had always known shoved hard against him. Again, he felt the blow in the solar plexus and saw the grey tentacles of the living reality reach for his heart.</p>
    <p>Jack looked up at the stranger, who was just about to put his spectacles on the bridge of his long nose. His eyelids were closed. Jack never did see his eyes.</p>
    <p>That didn’t bother him. He had other things to think about. He crouched beside the chair while his brain tried to move again, tried to engulf a thought and failed because it could not become fluid enough to find the idea that would move his tongue to shriek, <emphasis>No! No! No!</emphasis></p>
    <p>And when the salesman rose and placed his papers in his case and patted Jack on the head and bent his opaque rose spectacles at him and said good-by and that he wouldn’t be coming back because he was going out of town to stay, Jack was not able to move or say a thing. Nor for a long time after the door had closed could he break through the mass that gripped him like hardened lava. By then, no amount of screams and weeping would bring Mister back. All his father could do was to call a doctor who took the boy’s temperature and gave him pills.</p>

     <p>IV</p>
    </title>
    <p>Jack stood inside the wire and bent his neck back to watch a huge black and silver oyster feel the dusk for a landing-field with its single white foot and its orange toes. Blindingly, lights sprang to attention over the camp.</p>
    <p>When Jack had blinked his eyes back to normal, he could see over the flat half-mile between the fence and the ship. It lay quiet and glittering and smoking in the flood-beams. He could see the round door in its side swing open. Men began filing out. A truck rumbled across the plain and pulled up beside the metal bulk. A very tall man stepped out of the cab and halted upon the running board, from which he seemed to be greeting the newcomers or giving them instructions. Whatever he was saying took so long that Jack lost interest.</p>
    <p>Lately, he had not been able to focus his mind for any length of time upon anything except that one event in the past. He wandered around and whipped glances at his comrades’ faces, noting listlessly that their uniforms and shaved heads had improved their appearance. But nothing would be able to chill the feverishness of their eyes.</p>
    <p>Whistles shrilled. Jack jumped. His heart beat faster. He felt as if the end of the quest were suddenly close. Somebody would be around the comer. In a minute that person would be facing him, and then . . .</p>
    <p>Then, he reflected, and sagged with a wave of disappointment at the thought, then there was nobody around the comer. It always happened that way. Besides, there weren’t any corners in this camp. He had reached the wall at the end of the alley. Why didn’t he stop looking?</p>
    <p>Sergeants lined the prisoners up four abreast preparatory to marching them into the barracks. Jack supposed it was time to turn in for the night. He submitted to their barked orders and hard hands without resentment. They seemed a long way off. For the ten thousandth time, he was thinking that this need not have happened.</p>
    <p>If he had been man enough to grapple with himself, to wrestle as Jacob did with the angel and not let loose until he had felled the problem, he could be teaching philosophy in a quiet little college, as his father did. He had graduated from high school, and then, instead of going to college, as his father had so much wanted him to, he had decided he would work a year. With his earnings, he would see the world.</p>
    <p>He had seen it, but, when his money ran out, he had not returned home. He had drifted, taking jobs here and there, sleeping in flop-houses, jungles, park benches, and freight cars.</p>
    <p>When the newly created Bureau of Health and Sanity had frozen jobs in an effort to solve the transiency problem, Jack had refused to work. He knew that he would not be able to quit a job without being arrested at once. Like hundreds of thousands of other youths, he had begged and stolen and hidden from the local police and the Bohas.</p>
    <p>Even through all those years of misery and wandering, he had not once admitted to himself the true nature of this fog-cottoned grail. He knew it, and he did not know it. It was patroling the edge of his mind, circling a faroff periphery, recognizable by a crude silhouette but nameless. Any time he wanted to, he could have summoned it closer and said, <emphasis>You are it, and I know you, and I know what I am looking for. It is</emphasis> ... ?<emphasis> Is what? Worthless? Foolish? InsaneP A dream?</emphasis></p>
    <p>Jack had never had the courage to take that action. When it seemed the thing was galloping closer, charging down upon him, he ran away. It must stay on the horizon, moving on, always moving, staying out of his grasp.</p>
    <p>“All you guys, for’ard ’arch!”</p>
    <p>Jack did not move. The truck from the rocket had come through a gate and stopped by the transies, and about fifty men were getting off the back.</p>
    <p>The man behind Jack bumped into him. Jack paid him no attention. He did not move. He squinted at the group who had come from the rocket. They were very tall, hump-shouldered, and dressed in light grey-green Palm Beach suits and tan Panama hats. Each held a brown leather briefcase at the end of a long, thin arm. Each wore on the bridge of his long nose a pair of rose-colored glasses.</p>
    <p>A cry broke hoarsely from the transies. Some of those in front of Jack fell to their kees as if a sudden poison had paralyzed their legs. They called out and stretched out open hands. A boy by Jack's side sprawled face-down on the sand while he uttered over and over again, “Mr. Pelopoeus! Mr. Pelopoeus!”</p>
    <p>The name meant nothing to Jack. He did feel repulsed at seeing the fellow turn on his side, bend his neck forward, bring his clenched fists up against his chest, and jackknife his legs against his arms. He had seen it many times before in the transie jungles, but he had never gotten over the sickness it had first caused him.</p>
    <p>He turned away and came almost nose to nose with one of the men from the rocket. He had put down his briefcase so it rested against his leg and taken a white handkerchief out of his breast pocket to wipe the dust from his lenses. His lids were squeezed shut as if he found the lights unbearable.</p>
    <p>Jack stared and could not move while a name that the boy behind him had been crying out slowly worked it way through his consciousness. Suddenly, like the roar of a flashflood that is just rounding the bend of a dry gulch, the syllables struck him. He lunged forward and clutched at the spectacles in the man’s hand. At the same time he yelled over and over the words that had filled out the blank in his memory.</p>
    <p>“Mr. Eumenes! Mr. Eumenes!”</p>
    <p>A sergeant cursed and slammed his fist into Jack’s face. Jack fell down, fiat on his back. Though his jaw felt as if it were tom loose from its hinge, he rolled over on his side, raised himself on his hands and knees, and began to get up to his feet.</p>
    <p>“Stand still!” bellowed the sergeant. “Stay in formation or you’ll get more of the same!”</p>
    <p>Jack shook his head until it cleared. He crouched and held out his hands toward the man, but he did not move his feet. Over and over, half-chanting, half-crooning, he said, “Mr. Eumenes! The glasses! Please, Mr. Eumenes, the glasses 1”</p>
    <p>The forty-nine Mr. Eumenae-and-otherwise looked incuriously with impenetrable rosy eyes. The fiftieth put the white handkerchief back in his pocket. His 'mouth opened. False teeth gleamed. With his free hand he took off his hat and waved it at the crowd and bowed.</p>
    <p>His tilted head showed a white fuzzlike hair that shot up over his pale scalp. His gestures were both comic and terrifying. The hat and the inclination of his body said far more than words could. They said, <emphasis>Good-by forever and bon voyage!</emphasis></p>
    <p>Then, Mr. Eumenes straightened up and opened his lids.</p>
    <p>At first, the sockets looked as if they held no eyeballs, as if they were empty of all but shadows.</p>
    <p>Jack saw them from a distance. Mr. Eumenes-or-his-twin was shooting away faster and faster and becoming smaller and smaller. No! He himself was. He was rocketing away within his own body. He was falling down a deep well.</p>
    <p>He, Jack Crane, was a hollow shaft down which he slipped and screamed, away, away, from the world outside. It was like seeing from the wrong end of a pair of binoculars that lengthened and lengthened while the man. with the long-sought-for treasure in his hand flew in the opposite direction as if he had been connected to the horizon by a rubber band and somebody had released it and he was flying towards it, away from Jack.</p>
    <p>Even as this happened, as he knew vaguely that his muscles were locking into the posture of a beggar, hands out, pleading, face twisted into an agony of asking, lips repeating his croon-chant, he saw what had occurred.</p>
    <p>The realization was like the sudden, blinding, and at the same time clarifying light that sometimes comes to epileptics just as they are going into a seizure. It was the thought that he had kept away on the horizon of his mind, the thought that now charged in on him with long leaps and bounds and then stopped and sat on its haunches and grinned at him while its long tongue lolled.</p>
    <p>Of course, he should have known all these years what it was. He should have known that Mr. Eumenes was the worst thing in the world for him. He had known it, but, like a drug addict, he had refused to admit it. He had searched for the man. Yet he had known it would be fatal to find him. The rose-colored spectacles would swing gates that should never be fully open. And he should have guessed <emphasis>what</emphasis> and <emphasis>who</emphasis> Mr. Eumenes was when that encyclopedic fellow in the truck had singsonged those names.</p>
    <p>How could he have been so stupid? Stupid? It was easy! He had <emphasis>wanted</emphasis> to be stupid! And how could the Mr. Eumenes-or-otherwise have used such obvious giveaway names? It was a measure of their contempt for the humans around them and of their own grim wit. Look at all the double entendres the salesman had given his father, and his father had never suspected. Even the head of the Bureau of Health and Sanity had been terrifyingly blase about it.</p>
    <p>Dr. Vespa. He had thrown his name like a gauntlet to humanity, and humanity had stared idiotically at it and never guessed its meaning. Vespa was an Italian name. Jack didn’t know what it meant, but he supposed that it had the same meaning as the Latin. He remembered it from his high school class.</p>
    <p>As for his not encountering the salesman until now, he had been lucky. If he had run across him luring his search, he would have been denied the glasses, as now. And the shock would have made him unable to cry out and betray the man. He would have done what he was so helplessly doing at this moment, and he would have been carted off to an institution.</p>
    <p>How many other transies had seen that unforgettable face on the streets, the end of their search, and gone at once into that state that made them legal prey of the Bohas?</p>
    <p>That was almost his last rational thought. He could no longer feel his flesh. A thin red curtain was falling between him and his senses. Everywhere it billowed out beneath him and eased his fall. Everywhere it swirled and softened the outlines of things that were streaking by—a large tree that lie remembered seeing in his living room, a naked giant, his father, leaning against it and eating an apple, and a delicate little white creature cropping flowers.</p>
    <p>Yet all this while he lived in two worlds. One was the passage downwards towards the Garden of Eden. The other was that hemisphere in which he had dwelt so reluctantly, the one he now perceived through the thickening red veil of his sight and other senses.</p>
    <p>They were not yet gone. He could feel the hands of the black-clad officers lifting him up and laying him upon some hard substance that rocked and dumped. Every lurch and thud was only dimly felt. Then he was placed upon something softer and carried into what he vaguely sensed was the interior of one of the barracks.</p>
    <p>Some time later—he didn’t know or care when, for he had lost all conception or even definition of time—he looked up the deep everlengthening shaft of himself into the eyes of another Mr. Eumenes or Mr. Sphex or Dr. Vespa or whatever he called himself. He was in white and wore a stethoscope around his neck.</p>
    <p>Beside him stood another of his own kind. This one wore lipstick and a nurse’s cap. She carried a tray on which were several containers. One container held a large and sharp scalpel. The other held an egg. It was about the size of a hen’s egg-Jack saw all this just before the veil took on another shade of red and blurred completely his vision of the outside. But the final thickening did not keep him from seeing that Doctor Eumenes was staring down at him as if he were peering into a dusky burrow. And Jack could make out the eyes. They were large, much larger than they should have been at the speed with which Jack was receding. They were not the pale pink of an albino’s. They were black from comer to comer and built of a dozen or so hexagons whose edges caught the light.</p>
    <p>The twinkled.</p>
    <p>Like jewels.</p>
    <p>Or the eyes of an enormous and evolved wasp.</p>

    <p><strong>TOTEM AND TABOO</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>Kathy Phelan told her fiancee, “Jay, you can take your choice. Give up drinking or give up me.”</p>
   <p>Jay Martin was convinced she meant it. Her triangular face was set in tense lines, and her slanting green eyes burned.</p>
   <p>He made one more protest. “But, kitten, I’m not an alcoholic. Just a light-heavy drinker, almost a middleweight, you might say.”</p>
   <p>She bared little sharp teeth with extraordinarily long canines.</p>
   <p>“Flyweight, shmyweight, what’s the difference? You’re no champ. You never go more than six rounds before you’re flat on your back.”</p>
   <p>Pretty as a prize Siamese—and her bite was as sharp. Sadly, Jay Martin said he would, of course, not hesitate a moment about his choice. She smiled and purred and ran her little red-pink tongue out to moisten her lips for his goodby kiss.</p>
   <p>Like a wounded crow dragging his broken wing behind him, Jay Martin limped into the Green Lizard Lounge. It was the best place he could think of in which to brood over his decision not to drink anymore. A dry Martini was just the thing in which to mingle sorrow and anger.</p>
   <p>Ivan Tursiops entered a moment later, almost literally dived into a huge schooner of beer, rolled and reveled in it, then, after blowing and snorting relief and rhapsody, condescended to listen to Jay’s story. He was properly sympathetic.</p>
   <p>“You can’t help your urge towards the battle, you know,” he said. “What you need is a good psychiatrist.”</p>
   <p>“The only one I know is an alcoholic.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, now, he’s not the only one in the world. The trouble with you, my boy, is you don’t hobnob with enough neurotics. Now I’ve dozens for friends, and every one swears by a different witch doctor. But I’ve heard recently of one fellow who’s so good I’m afraid to see him. I might lose my neurosis, you know, and I couldn’t afford that.”</p>
   <p>“You mean your total inability to hear your mother-in-law?”</p>
   <p>“Exactly. Look, here’s his address. The new Medical Arts Building.”</p>
   <p>Doctor Capra pulled on his chin-whiskers and said, “Yes, I’m of a new school of thought. We take the anthropological approach. Have you read the recent authoritative article on our theories in the August <emphasis>Commuters Digest</emphasis>”</p>
   <p>Jay nodded. Dr. Capra looked pleased and glanced at his watch. His waiting room was full.</p>
   <p>“Then you know the essentials. Why waste time repeating them? You must be an intelligent man; you graduated from college. Business administration, I believe?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Doctor. Look, Kathy loves me, but she dominates me. She wants to run every minute of my life. And . . .” “Never mind that, Mr. Martin. Or may I call you Jay? Pay no attention to what your fiancee is doing. I assure you the Freudians and their mother-complexes were way off. It’s not at all necessary that I know your personal difficulties. We-”</p>
   <p>“But she’s made me give up almost everything I like. Now, I don’t mind . . .”</p>
   <p>“All that’s of no consequence at all, Jay. Hal <emphasis>Hmm!”</emphasis></p>
   <p>The doctor was holding up four photographs of Jay, each made from a different angle. He stroked his chin-whiskers.</p>
   <p>“Excellent. No border case here. You’re definitely the avian type.”</p>
   <p>Ignoring Jay’s torrential story of his conflicts with Kathy, he said. “Look at the tall thin and gangling body. Stork. Look at the shock of hair. Kingfisher. Big round eyes. Owl. Hooked nose. Falcon. Big and friendly but slightly mocking grin. Laughing jackass.”</p>
   <p>“Say!” said Jay. “I resent—”</p>
   <p>“No doubt of it, young man. You’re a classical type. There’ll be no trouble at all, at all.”</p>
   <p>Dr. Capara rubbed his hands in professional glee and then handed Jay Martin a pillbox. “One every two hours, my boy, until your tutelary totem appears.”</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>“You read the article, didn’t you? You know that primitive societies were quite correct in dividing their people into clans, each of which had a guiding and protecting spirit of totem modeled after a particular animal, don’t you? We psychiatrists of the anthropological school have found that the primitives unconsciously stumbled over a great truth. Every man is, in his subconscious, a bear or fox or weasel or mapgie or pig, or what have you. Watch your friends. Observe their types of bodies, their faces, their actions, their characters. All modeled upon some zoological prototype.</p>
   <p>“This pill is the result of our collaborations with the neurologists and biochemists. It organizes your subconscious so that your subjective totem seems to be projected objectively. In fact, it may be, for all we know, for we’ve never succeeded in catching one. However . . .”</p>
   <p>“But, Doctor, don’t you want to hear what my trouble is? Kathy says . . .”</p>
   <p>Capra glanced at his wrist watch, stood up, smiling, and gently butted Jay out of the office with his hands.</p>
   <p>“Come back at this time next week. I can give you five minutes.”</p>
   <p>“But, Doc, Kathy says I drink too much!”</p>
   <p>Capra stopped, frowned, and pulled on his yellow-brown goatee.</p>
   <p>“I knew there was something. Ah, yes, don’t drink any liquor while you’re taking these pills, my boy. Might disorganize the subconscious, you know.”</p>
   <p>“But, but... I”</p>
   <p>“Not now, Mister Martin.”</p>
   <p>Ivan Tursiops looked up from the depths of his beer. “How’d it go?”</p>
   <p>“I just told Kathy. Her fur really bristled; I was lucky to get away with only a verbal mauling. She says I should ignore - Capra’s com. All I need is a strong will power. If I loved her enough, I’d . . .”</p>
   <p>Ivan beckoned to the waitress.</p>
   <p>“Dry martini.”</p>
   <p>“No, thanks,” said Jay. “Doctor’s orders. And Kathy threatened to scratch my eyes out if I ever came around with liquor on my breath again. Everybody’s against me. . . .”</p>
   <p>The waitress set down the martini. Absently, broodingly, Jay sipped. Ivan said, “Pay no attention to either, my boy. I was just talking to Bob White, and he said he knows a hell of a good psychiatrist who uses the over-do-it approach. Just what you need. If your neurosis is alcohol, you don’t try to quit hitting the bottle. You try to drink <emphasis>too</emphasis> much.”</p>
   <p>Jay downed his martini. His eyes were bright. “Yeah? Tell me more.”</p>
   <p>“Waitress!”</p>
   <p>Jay Martin awoke at noon the following day. Because it was Saturday and he didn’t have to work, he didn’t care that it was so late. But he did mind that he had to wake up at all. Seven martinis before he lost count. That meant a head the size of the <emphasis>Hindenburg</emphasis> and one just as ready to burst into flames. He’d be riding a seismograph of nausea and . . .</p>
   <p>But he wasn’t. His head was clear as a freshly wiped cocktail glass, and his nerves firm as a bartender’s hand scooping up a tip.</p>
   <p>It was then that he saw, perched on the foot of his bed, the bird.</p>
   <p>The jagbird.</p>
   <p>It was big as a bald eagle. It <emphasis>was</emphasis> bald, and the bags under its squinting bloodshot eyes were packed with dissipation. Its long bulbous red beak hung open to expose a swollen tongue with purple hair. Its frizzled black plumage reeked of stale beer; its breath was the morning-after’s.</p>
   <p>If Jay had not felt so healthy, he would have sworn that this was the first hallucination of an attack of D.T.’s.</p>
   <p>“Go away!” he said.</p>
   <p>“Nevermore!” croaked the jagbird.</p>
   <p>It was some time before Jay understood that the phrase was not a reply to his request that it leave. It was, literally, Jay’s usual vow on awakening after a hard night.</p>
   <p>Jay got up and made some coffee. While he was drinking it, the bird flew in and perched on the chair across the table.</p>
   <p>“Nevermore!”</p>
   <p>If it hadn’t been for the creature, Jay would have been able to eat a hearty breakfast, something he hadn’t done for several years.</p>
   <p>He got up and walked out. The bird flew through the door just as he opened it. And it insisted on perching upon his shoulder and croaking every sixty seconds, regular and monotonous as a metronome, “Nevermore!”</p>
   <p>When he brushed it away, it flapped heavily above him so its shadow always fell on Jay’s head.</p>
   <p>Jay was afraid to visit Kathy, so he went to a movie. The bird flew in with him, nor was it asked for a ticket. When Jay sat down, it perched upon his shoulder. The woman behind Jay did not seem to be bothered by it, so he decided that it must be a hallucination. It was a visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory triumph for Dr. Capra’s little pills. Jay wanted to read the riot act to the psychiatrist, but he was afraid that he would be asked if he’d been . drinking liquor while taking the pills. Not only had he done so, he had swallowed all of them at once during a fit of bravado when Ivan Tursiops had said that they were probably nothing but sugar.</p>
   <p>At exactly 5 o’clock, the jagbird disappeared. Puzzled but elated, Jay left the movie a few minutes later. It was not until he was just about to step into the Green Lizard that he remembered his hangovers always left him at that time.</p>
   <p>He raised his eyebrows and went on in. His eyebrows soared even higher when he saw the bird sitting on the bar, waiting for him. Jay ignored it and ordered a martini. He lifted it to his lips.</p>
   <p><emphasis>"Hic!”</emphasis> belched the bird.</p>
   <p>At the same time it breathed in his face.</p>
   <p>“Aagh!”</p>
   <p>“What’s the matter?” said the bartender. “You chokin’ or somepin?”</p>
   <p>“Can’t you smell it?” wheezed Jay.</p>
   <p>“Smell what?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing.”</p>
   <p>The jagbird had put one heavy foot on the edge of the glass. Its talon, like a waiter’s dirty thumb, dipped into the drink. It’s red eyes, purple in the lounge’s dim light, squinted reproachfully.</p>
   <p>“Hie/” it said.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Haec!”</emphasis> sneered Jay.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Hoc</emphasis>/” trumped the bird.</p>
   <p>“Heck!” groaned Jay.</p>
   <p>He left the martini untouched. He couldn’t argue with a bird who could decline Latin.</p>
   <p>Kathy was so pleased to see Jay sober and with not even the hint of liquor on his breath that she almost purred. Her suspicion-slanted eyes widened into a soft golden-green.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Jay, you’ve really sworn off. You love me!”</p>
   <p>Her kiss was more than warm. He didn’t enjoy it as much as he should, and she felt it. She stiffened, narrowed her eyes, and put her sharp nails on his arm.</p>
   <p>“What’s the matter? Aren’t you happy? Do you regret doing this for me?”</p>
   <p>“Bring me a drink.”</p>
   <p>“What? I will not!”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I won’t touch it ... I think.”</p>
   <p>Kathy sensed urgency. She went to the liquor cabinet and poured a scotch. He watched her and wondered again why he had to give up drinking when she wouldn’t. She had explained that she did not <emphasis>have</emphasis> to drink, but he did. Would he be a dog-in-the-manger and ask her to give up her harmless enjoyment because it was for him a vicious habit? Feeling like a selfish brute, he had said no. But he couldn’t help a little bitterness.</p>
   <p>She handed him the scotch. Instantly, the jagbird stuck its big bulbous beak between cup and lip.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Hid”</emphasis></p>
   <p>Jay handed the glass back to Kathy.</p>
   <p>“See?”</p>
   <p>She didn’t. He explained. Instead of relaxing, her eyes slitted even more, and her nails scratched his arm.</p>
   <p>“Do you mean this bird will <emphasis>always</emphasis> be with us? Even after we’re married? We’ll <emphasis>never</emphasis> be alone?”</p>
   <p>There was no soft plaintive note in her voice. Only a hiss of anger and determination.</p>
   <p>He patted her arm. “It’s not a real bird, kitten. <emphasis>You</emphasis> can’t see it.”</p>
   <p>“No, but I’ll know it’s therel I won’t be able to forget it. It’ll make me nervous as a catl Not only that, but I don’t like your giving up liquor because of some crazy bird. I want you to do it on your own will power, to stand on your own two feet.”</p>
   <p>“If it weren’t for my totem,” he said, “I’d not be standing on my feet now. I’d be under the table at the Green Lizard.”</p>
   <p>“That’s what I thoughtl” she spat. “Where is the jagbird now?”</p>
   <p>He jerked his thumb at the end table, where it perched, sleepy-eyed, upon the ceramic bust of a Silenus. She stared vainly, burst into tears, and said, “Oh, if only I could see it! If only ...”</p>
   <p>She stopped and dried her eyes. She became soft and furry-voiced.</p>
   <p>“What is the address of this Dr. Capra, honey?”</p>
   <p>It was a moment before he could see what she intended doing. She looked unconcernedly at him and even yawned, as if the whole matter had all at once become of no importance.</p>
   <p>He blinked rapidly, like a startled owl. The outlines of her body had wavered and then congealed. They had remained fixed for only the space of a wink, but long enough. There was no mistaking the long bristling whiskers, the fangs revealed by the yawn, and the narrow-pupiled eyes. Nor the I’m-about-to-swallow-the-canary expression.</p>
   <p>He strode past her, scooped up the jagbird, and lunged through the door.</p>
   <p>Kathy screamed, “Jay, come back!”</p>
   <p>“Nevermore!” croaked the bird, its head sticking out from under its owner’s arm.</p>
   <p>Jay Martin is now married to a little woman with a spaniel’s big brown eyes. Her devotion to him has been described by their friends as dog-like. They act like two lovebirds. He no longer drinks like a fish, and he has become a whale of a success in the business world. He seems to be gifted with some uncanny instinct which enables him to judge a person’s character at a glance. Last year he joined the bulls, cornered the bears, and made a big killing among the wolves of Wall Street.</p>
