 <p>AUTHOR'S NOTE:</p>
 <p>Over the past twenty years, I have written a series of books about my apprenticeship with </p>
 <p>a Mexican Yaqui Indian sorcerer, don Juan Matus. I have explained in those books that </p>
 <p>he taught me sorcery but not as we understand sorcery in the context of our daily world: </p>
 <p>the use of supernatural powers over others, or the calling of spirits through charms, </p>
 <p>spells, or rituals to produce supernatural effects. For don Juan, sorcery was the act of </p>
 <p>embodying some specialized theoretical and practical premises about the nature and role </p>
 <p>of perception in molding the universe around us.</p>
 <p>Following don Juan's suggestion, I have refrained from using shamanism, a category </p>
 <p>proper to anthropology, to classify his knowledge. I have called it all along what he </p>
 <p>himself called it: sorcery. On examination, however, I realized that calling it sorcery </p>
 <p>obscures even more the already obscure phenomena he presented to me in his teachings.</p>
 <p>In anthropological works, shamanism is described as a belief system of some native </p>
 <p>people of northern Asia-prevailing also among certain native North American Indian </p>
 <p>tribes-which maintains that an unseen world of ancestral spiritual forces, good and evil, </p>
 <p>is pervasive around us and that these spiritual forces can be summoned or controlled </p>
 <p>through the acts of practitioners, who are the intermediaries between the natural and </p>
 <p>supernatural realms.</p>
 <p>Don Juan was indeed an intermediary between the natural world of everyday life and an </p>
 <p>unseen world, which he called not the supernatural but the second attention. His role as a </p>
 <p>teacher was to make this configuration accessible to me. I have described in my previous </p>
 <p>work his teaching methods to this effect, as well as the sorcery arts he made me practice, </p>
 <p>the most important of which is called the art of dreaming.</p>
 <p>Don Juan contended that our world, which we believe to be unique and absolute, is only </p>
 <p>one in a cluster of consecutive worlds, arranged like the layers of an onion. He asserted </p>
 <p>that even though we have been energetically conditioned to perceive solely our world, we </p>
 <p>still have the capability of entering into those other realms, which are as real, unique, </p>
 <p>absolute, and engulfing as our own world is.</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained to me that, for us to perceive those other realms, not only do we have </p>
 <p>to covet them but we need to have sufficient energy to seize them. Their existence is </p>
 <p>constant and independent of our awareness, he said, but their inaccessibility is entirely a </p>
 <p>consequence of our energetic conditioning. In other words, simply and solely because of </p>
 <p>that conditioning, we are compelled to assume that the world of daily life is the one and </p>
 <p>only possible world.</p>
 <p>Believing that our energetic conditioning is correctable, don Juan stated that sorcerers of </p>
 <p>ancient times developed a set of practices designed to recondition our energetic </p>
 <p>capabilities to perceive. They called this set of practices the art of dreaming.</p>
 <p>With the perspective time gives, I now realize that the most fitting statement don Juan </p>
 <p>made about dreaming was to call it the "gateway to infinity." I remarked, at the time he </p>
 <p>said it, that the metaphor had no meaning to me.</p>
 <p>"Let's then do away with metaphors," he conceded. "Let's say that dreaming is the </p>
 <p>sorcerers' practical way of putting ordinary dreams to use."</p>
 <p>"But how can ordinary dreams be put to use?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"We always get tricked by words," he said. "In my own case, my teacher attempted to </p>
 <p>describe dreaming to me by saying that it is the way sorcerers say good night to the </p>
 <p>world. He was, of course, tailoring his description to fit my mentality. I'm doing the same </p>
 <p>with you."</p>
 <p>On another occasion don Juan said to me, "Dreaming can only be experienced. Dreaming </p>
 <p>is not just having dreams; neither is it daydreaming or wishing or imagining. Through </p>
 <p>dreaming we can perceive other worlds, which we can certainly describe, but we can't </p>
 <p>describe what makes us perceive them. Yet we can feel how dreaming opens up those </p>
 <p>other realms. Dreaming seems to be a sensation-a process in our bodies, an awareness </p>
 <p>in our minds."</p>
 <p>In the course of his general teachings, don Juan thoroughly explained to me the </p>
 <p>principles, rationales, and practices of the art of dreaming. His instruction was divided </p>
 <p>into two parts.. One was about dreaming procedures, the other about the purely abstract </p>
 <p>explanations of these procedures. His teaching method was an interplay between enticing </p>
 <p>my intellectual curiosity with the abstract principles of dreaming and guiding me to seek </p>
 <p>an outlet in its practices.</p>
 <p>I have already described all this in as much detail as I was able to. And I have also </p>
 <p>described the sorcerers' milieu in which don Juan placed me in order to teach me his arts. </p>
 <p>My interaction in this milieu was of special interest to me because it took place </p>
 <p>exclusively in the second attention. I interacted there with the ten women and five men </p>
 <p>who were don Juan's sorcerer companions and with the four young men and the four </p>
 <p>young women who were his apprentices.</p>
 <p>Don Juan gathered them immediately after I came into his world. He made it clear to me </p>
 <p>that they formed a traditional sorcerers' group-a replica of his own party-and that I </p>
 <p>was supposed to lead them. However, working with me he realized that I was different </p>
 <p>than he expected. He explained that difference in terms of an energy configuration seen </p>
 <p>only by sorcerers:</p>
 <p>instead of having four compartments of energy, as he himself had, I had only three. Such </p>
 <p>a configuration, which he had mistakenly hoped was a correctable flaw, made me so </p>
 <p>completely inadequate for interacting with or leading those eight apprentices that it </p>
 <p>became imperative for don Juan to gather another group of people more akin to my </p>
 <p>energetic structure.</p>
 <p>I have written extensively about those events. Yet I have never mentioned the second </p>
 <p>group of apprentices; don Juan did not permit me to do so. He argued that they were </p>
 <p>exclusively in my field and that the agreement I had with him was to write about his field, </p>
 <p>not mine.</p>
 <p>The second group of apprentices was extremely compact. It had only three members: a </p>
 <p>dreamer, Florinda Donner-Grau; a stalker, Taisha Abelar; and a nagual woman, Carol </p>
 <p>Tiggs.</p>
 <p>We interacted with one another solely in the second attention. In the world of everyday </p>
 <p>life, we did not have even a vague notion of one another. In terms of our relationship with </p>
 <p>don Juan, however, there was no vagueness; he put enormous effort into training all of us </p>
 <p>equally. Nevertheless, toward the end, when don Juan's time was about to finish, the </p>
 <p>psychologi cal pressure of his departure started to collapse the rigid boundaries of the </p>
 <p>second attention. The result was that our interaction began to lapse into the world of </p>
 <p>everyday affairs, and we met, seemingly for the first time.</p>
 <p>None of us, consciously, knew about our deep and arduous interaction in the second </p>
 <p>attention. Since all of us were involved in academic studies, we ended up more than </p>
 <p>shocked when we found out we had met before. This was and still is, of course, </p>
 <p>intellectually inadmissible to us, yet we know that it was thoroughly within our </p>
 <p>experience. We have been left, therefore, with the disquieting knowledge that the human </p>
 <p>psyche is infinitely more complex than our mundane or academic reasoning had led us to </p>
 <p>believe.</p>
 <p>Once we asked don Juan, in unison, to shed light on our predicament. He said that he had </p>
 <p>two explanatory options. One was to cater to our hurt rationality and patch it up, saying </p>
 <p>that the second attention is a state of awareness as illusory as elephants flying in the sky </p>
 <p>and that everything we thought we</p>
 <p>had experienced in that state was simply a product of hypnotic suggestions. The other </p>
 <p>option was to explain it the way sorcerer dreamers understand it: as an energetic </p>
 <p>configuration of aware ness.</p>
 <p>During the fulfillment of my dreaming tasks, however, the barrier of the second attention </p>
 <p>remained unchanged. Every time I entered into dreaming, I also entered into the second </p>
 <p>attention, and waking up from dreaming did not necessarily mean I had left the second </p>
 <p>attention. For years I could remember only bits of my dreaming experiences. The bulk of </p>
 <p>what I did was energetically unavailable to me. It took me fifteen years of uninterrupted </p>
 <p>work, from 1973 to 1988, to store enough energy to rearrange everything linearly in my </p>
 <p>mind. I remembered then sequences upon sequences of dreaming events, and I was able </p>
 <p>to fill in, at last, some seeming lapses of memory. In this manner I captured the inherent </p>
 <p>continuity of don Juan's lessons in the art of dreaming, a continuity that had been lost to </p>
 <p>me because of his making me weave between the awareness of our everyday life and the </p>
 <p>awareness of the second attention. This work is a result of that rearrangement.</p>
 <p>All this brings me to the final part of my statement: the reason for writing this book. </p>
 <p>Being in possession of most of the pieces of don Juan's lessons in the art of dreaming, I </p>
 <p>would like to explain, in a future work, the current position and interest of his last four </p>
 <p>students: Florinda Donner-Grau, Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs, and myself. But before I </p>
 <p>describe and explain the results of don Juan's guidance and influence on us, I must </p>
 <p>review, in light of what I know now, the parts of don Juan's lessons in dreaming to which </p>
 <p>I did not have access before.</p>
 <p>The definitive reason for this work, however, was given by Carol Tiggs. Her belief is that </p>
 <p>explaining the world that don Juan made us inherit is the ultimate expression of our </p>
 <p>gratitude to him and our commitment to his quest.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 1</p>
 <p>SORCERERS OF ANTIQUITY:</p>
 <p>AN INTRODUCTION</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>on Juan stressed, time and time again, that every thing he was teaching me had been </p>
 <p>envisioned and worked out by men he referred to as sorcerers of antiquity. He made it </p>
 <p>very clear that there was a profound distinction between those sorcerers and the sorcerers </p>
 <p>of modem times. He categorized sorcerers of antiquity as men who existed in Mexico </p>
 <p>perhaps thousands of years before the Spanish Conquest, men whose greatest </p>
 <p>accomplishment had been to build the structures of sorcery, emphasizing practicality and </p>
 <p>concreteness. He rendered them as men who were brilliant but lacking in wisdom. </p>
 <p>Modem sorcerers, by contrast, don Juan portrayed as men renowned for their sound </p>
 <p>minds and their capacity to rectify the course of sorcery if they deemed it necessary.</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained to me that the sorcery premises pertinent to dreaming were naturally </p>
 <p>envisioned and developed by sorcerers of antiquity Out of necessity-for those premises </p>
 <p>are key in explaining and understanding dreaming-I again have to write about and </p>
 <p>discuss them. The major part of this book is, therefore, a reintroduction and amplification </p>
 <p>of what I have presented in my previous works.</p>
 <p>During one of our conversations, don Juan stated that, in order to appreciate the position </p>
 <p>of dreamers and dreaming, one has to understand the struggle of modern-day sorcerers to </p>
 <p>steer sorcery away from concreteness toward the abstract.</p>
 <p>"What do you call concreteness, don Juan?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"The practical part of sorcery," he said. "The obsessive fixation of the mind on practices </p>
 <p>and techniques, the unwarranted influence over people. All of these were in the realm of </p>
 <p>the sorcerers of the past."</p>
 <p>"And what do you call the abstract?"</p>
 <p>"The search for freedom, freedom to perceive, without obsessions, all that's humanly </p>
 <p>possible. I say that present-day sorcerers seek the abstract because they seek freedom; </p>
 <p>they have no interest in concrete gains. There are no social functions for them, as there </p>
 <p>were for the sorcerers of the past. So you'll never catch them being the official seers or </p>
 <p>the sorcerers in residence."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that the past has no value to modern-day sorcerers?"</p>
 <p>"It certainly has value. It's the taste of that past which we don't like. I personally detest </p>
 <p>the darkness and morbidity of the mind. I like the immensity of thought. However, </p>
 <p>regardless of my likes and dislikes, I have to give due credit to the sorcerers of antiquity, </p>
 <p>for they were the first to find out and do every thing we know and do today.</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that their most important attainment</p>
 <p>was to perceive the energetic essence of things. This insight was of such importance that </p>
 <p>it was turned into the basic premise of sorcery. Nowadays, after lifelong discipline and </p>
 <p>training, sorcerers do acquire the capacity to perceive the essence of things, a capacity </p>
 <p>they call seeing.</p>
 <p>"What would it mean to me to perceive the energetic essence of things?" I once asked </p>
 <p>don Juan.</p>
 <p>"It would mean that you perceive energy directly," he replied. "By separating the social </p>
 <p>part of perception, you'll perceive the essence of everything. Whatever we are perceiving </p>
 <p>is energy, but since we can't directly perceive energy we process our perception to fit a </p>
 <p>mold. This mold is the social part of perception, which you have to separate."</p>
 <p>"Why do I have to separate it?"</p>
 <p>"Because it deliberately reduces the scope of what can be perceived and makes us believe </p>
 <p>that the mold into which we fit our perception is all that exists. I am convinced that for </p>
 <p>man to survive now, his perception must change at its social base."</p>
 <p>"What is this social base of perception, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"The physical certainty that the world is made of concrete objects. I call this a social base </p>
 <p>because a serious and fierce effort is put out by everybody to guide us to perceive the </p>
 <p>world the way we do."</p>
 <p>"How then should we perceive the world?"</p>
 <p>"Everything is energy. The whole universe is energy. The social base of our perception </p>
 <p>should be the physical certainty that energy is all there is. A mighty effort should be </p>
 <p>made to guide us to perceive energy as energy. Then we would have both alternatives at </p>
 <p>our fingertips."</p>
 <p>"Is it possible to train people in such a fashion?" I asked.</p>
 <p>Don Juan replied that it was possible and that this was precisely what he was doing with </p>
 <p>me and his other apprentices. He was teaching us a new way of perceiving, first, by </p>
 <p>making us realize we process our perception to fit a mold and, second, by fiercely </p>
 <p>guiding us to perceive energy directly. He assured me that this method was very much </p>
 <p>like the one used to teach us to perceive the world of daily affairs.</p>
 <p>Don Juan's conception was that our entrapment in process mg our perception to fit a </p>
 <p>social mold loses its power when we realize we have accepted this mold, as an </p>
 <p>inheritance from our ancestors, without bothering to examine it.</p>
 <p>"To perceive a world of hard objects that had either a positive or a negative value must </p>
 <p>have been utterly necessary for our ancestors' survival," don Juan said. "After ages of </p>
 <p>perceiving in such a manner, we are now forced to believe that the world is made up of </p>
 <p>objects."</p>
 <p>"I can't conceive the world in any other way, don Juan," I complained. "It is </p>
 <p>unquestionably a world of objects. To prove it, all we have to do is bump into them."</p>
 <p>"Of course it's a world of objects. We are not arguing that."</p>
 <p>"What are you saying then?"</p>
 <p>"I am saying that this is first a world of energy; then it's a world of objects. If we don't </p>
 <p>start with the premise that it is a world of energy, we'll never be able to perceive energy </p>
 <p>directly. We'll always be stopped by the physical certainty of what you've just pointed </p>
 <p>out: the hardness of objects."</p>
 <p>His argument was extremely mystifying to me. In those days, my mind would simply </p>
 <p>refuse to consider any way to understand the world except the one with which I was </p>
 <p>familiar. Don Juan's claims and the points he struggled to raise were outlandish </p>
 <p>propositions that I could not accept but could not refuse either.</p>
 <p>"Our way of perceiving is a predator's way," he said to me on one occasion. "A very </p>
 <p>efficient manner of appraising and classifying food and danger. But this is not the only </p>
 <p>way we are able to perceive. There is another mode, the one I am familiarizing you with: </p>
 <p>the act of perceiving the essence of everything, energy itself, directly.</p>
 <p>"To perceive the essence of everything will make us under stand, classify and describe </p>
 <p>the world in entirely new, more</p>
 <p>exciting, more sophisticated terms." This was don Juan's claim. And the more </p>
 <p>sophisticated terms to which he was alluding were those he had been taught by his </p>
 <p>predecessors, terms that correspond to sorcery truths, which have no rational foundation </p>
 <p>and no relation whatsoever to the facts of our daily world but which are self-evident </p>
 <p>truths for the sorcerers who perceive energy directly and see the essence of everything.</p>
 <p>For such sorcerers, the most significant act of sorcery is to see the essence of the </p>
 <p>universe. Don Juan's version was that the sorcerers of antiquity, the first ones to see the </p>
 <p>essence of the universe, described it in the best manner. They said that the essence of the </p>
 <p>universe resembles incandescent threads stretched into infinity in every conceivable </p>
 <p>direction, luminous filaments that are conscious of themselves in ways impossible for the </p>
 <p>human mind to comprehend.</p>
 <p>From seeing the essence of the universe, the sorcerers of antiquity went on to see the </p>
 <p>energy essence of human beings. Don Juan stated that they depicted human beings as </p>
 <p>bright shapes that resembled giant eggs and called them luminous eggs.</p>
 <p>"When sorcerers see a human being," don Juan said, "they see a giant, luminous shape </p>
 <p>that floats, making, as it moves, a deep furrow in the energy of the earth, just as if the </p>
 <p>luminous shape had a taproot that was dragging."</p>
 <p>Don Juan had the impression that our energy shape keeps on changing through time. He </p>
 <p>said that every seer he knew, him self included, saw that human beings are shaped more </p>
 <p>like balls or even tombstones than eggs. But, once in a while, and for no reason known to </p>
 <p>them, sorcerers see a person whose energy is shaped like an egg. Don Juan suggested that </p>
 <p>people who are egglike in shape today are more akin to people of ancient times.</p>
 <p>In the course of his teachings, don Juan repeatedly discussed and explained what he </p>
 <p>considered the decisive finding of the sorcerers of antiquity. He called it the crucial </p>
 <p>feature of human beings as luminous balls: a round spot of intense brilliance, the size of a </p>
 <p>tennis ball, permanently lodged inside the luminous ball, flush with its surface, about two </p>
 <p>feet back from the crest of a person's right shoulder blade.</p>
 <p>Since I had trouble visualizing this the first time don Juan described it to me, he </p>
 <p>explained that the luminous ball is much larger than the human body, that the spot of </p>
 <p>intense brilliance is part of this ball of energy and that it is located on a place at the height </p>
 <p>of the shoulder blades, an arm's length from a per son's back. He said that the old </p>
 <p>sorcerers named it the assemblage point after seeing what it does.</p>
 <p>"What does the assemblage point do?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"It makes us perceive," he replied. "The old sorcerers saw that, in human beings, </p>
 <p>perception is assembled there, on that point. Seeing that all living beings have such a </p>
 <p>point of brilliance, the old sorcerers surmised that perception in general must take place </p>
 <p>on that spot, in whatever pertinent manner."</p>
 <p>"What did the old sorcerers see that made them conclude that perception takes place on </p>
 <p>the assemblage point?" I asked.</p>
 <p>He answered that, first, they saw that out of the millions of the universe's luminous </p>
 <p>energy filaments passing through the entire luminous ball, only a small number pass </p>
 <p>directly through the assemblage point, as should be expected since it is small in </p>
 <p>comparison with the whole.</p>
 <p>Next, they saw that a spherical extra glow, slightly bigger than the assemblage point, </p>
 <p>always surrounds it, greatly intensifying the luminosity of the filaments passing directly </p>
 <p>through that glow.</p>
 <p>Finally, they saw two things. One, that the assemblage points of human beings can </p>
 <p>dislodge themselves from the spot where they are usually located. And, two, that when </p>
 <p>the assemblage point is on its habitual position, perception and awareness seem to be </p>
 <p>normal, judging by the normal behavior of the subjects being observed. But when their </p>
 <p>assemblage points and surrounding glowing spheres are on a different position than the </p>
 <p>habitual one, their unusual behavior seems to be the proof</p>
 <p>that their awareness is different, that they are perceiving in an unfamiliar manner.</p>
 <p>The conclusion the old sorcerers drew from all this was that the greater the displacement </p>
 <p>of the assemblage point from its customary position, the more unusual the consequent </p>
 <p>behavior and, evidently, the consequent awareness and perception.</p>
 <p>"Notice that when I talk about seeing, I always say 'having the appearance of' or 'seemed </p>
 <p>like," don Juan warned me. "Everything one sees is so unique that there is no way to talk </p>
 <p>about it except by comparing it to something known to us."</p>
 <p>He said that the most adequate example of this difficulty was the way sorcerers talk about </p>
 <p>the assemblage point and the glow that surrounds it. They describe them as brightness, </p>
 <p>yet it can not be brightness, because seers see them without their eyes. They have to fill </p>
 <p>out the difference, however, and say that the assemblage point is a spot of light and that </p>
 <p>around it there is a halo, a glow. Don Juan pointed out that we are so visual, so ruled by </p>
 <p>our predator's perception, that everything we see must be rendered in terms of what the </p>
 <p>predator's eye normally sees.</p>
 <p>After seeing what the assemblage point and its surrounding glow seemed to be doing, don </p>
 <p>Juan said that the old sorcerers advanced an explanation. They proposed that in human </p>
 <p>beings the assemblage point, by focusing its glowing sphere on the universe's filaments </p>
 <p>of energy that pass directly through it, automatically and without premeditation </p>
 <p>assembles those filaments into a steady perception of the world.</p>
 <p>"How are those filaments you talk about assembled into a steady perception of the </p>
 <p>world?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"No one can possibly know that," he emphatically replied. "Sorcerers see the movement </p>
 <p>of energy, but just seeing the movement of energy cannot tell them how or why energy </p>
 <p>moves."</p>
 <p>Don Juan stated that, seeing that millions of conscious energy filaments pass through the </p>
 <p>assemblage point, the old sorcerers postulated that in passing through it they come </p>
 <p>together, amassed by the glow that surrounds it. After seeing that the glow is extremely </p>
 <p>dim in people who have been rendered unconscious or are about to die, and that it is </p>
 <p>totally absent from corpses, they were convinced that this glow is awareness.</p>
 <p>"How about the assemblage point? Is it absent from a corpse?" I asked.</p>
 <p>He answered that there is no trace of an assemblage point on a dead being, because the </p>
 <p>assemblage point and its surrounding glow are the mark of life and consciousness. The </p>
 <p>inescapable conclusion of the sorcerers of antiquity was that awareness and perception go </p>
 <p>together and are tied to the assemblage point and the glow that surrounds it.</p>
 <p>"Is there a chance that those sorcerers might have been mistaken about their seeing?" I </p>
 <p>asked.</p>
 <p>"I can't explain to you why, but there is no way sorcerers can be mistaken about their </p>
 <p>seeing," don Juan said, in a tone that admitted no argument. "Now, the conclusions they </p>
 <p>arrive at from their seeing might be wrong, but that would be because they are naive, </p>
 <p>uncultivated. In order to avoid this disaster, sorcerers have to cultivate their minds, in </p>
 <p>whatever form they can."</p>
 <p>He softened up then and remarked that it certainly would be infinitely safer for sorcerers </p>
 <p>to remain solely at the level of describing what they see, but that the temptation to </p>
 <p>conclude and explain, even if only to oneself, is far too great to resist.</p>
 <p>The effect of the assemblage point's displacement was another energy configuration the </p>
 <p>sorcerers of antiquity were able to see and study. Don Juan said that when the assemblage </p>
 <p>point is displaced to another position, a new conglomerate of millions of luminous energy </p>
 <p>filaments come together on that• point. The sorcerers of antiquity saw this and concluded </p>
 <p>that since the glow of awareness is always present wherever the assemblage point is, </p>
 <p>perception is automatically assembled there. Because of the different position of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point, the resulting world, however, cannot be our world of daily affairs.</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that the old sorcerers were capable of distinguishing two types of </p>
 <p>assemblage point displacement. One was a displacement to any position on the surface or </p>
 <p>in the interior of the luminous ball; this displacement they called a shift of the assemblage </p>
 <p>point. The other was a displacement to a position outside the luminous ball; they called </p>
 <p>this displacement a movement of the assemblage point. They found out that the </p>
 <p>difference between a shift and a movement was the nature of the perception each allows.</p>
 <p>Since the shifts of the assemblage point are displacements within the luminous ball, the </p>
 <p>worlds engendered by them, no matter how bizarre or wondrous or unbelievable they </p>
 <p>might be, are still worlds within the human domain. The human domain is the energy </p>
 <p>filaments that pass through the entire luminous ball. By contrast, movements of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point since they are displacements to positions outside the luminous ball, </p>
 <p>engage filaments of energy that are beyond the human realm. Perceiving such filaments </p>
 <p>engenders worlds that are beyond comprehension, inconceivable worlds with no trace of </p>
 <p>human antecedents in them.</p>
 <p>The problem of validation always played a key role in my mind in those days. "Forgive </p>
 <p>me, don Juan," I said to him on one occasion, "but this business of the assemblage point </p>
 <p>is an idea so farfetched, so inadmissible that I don't know how to deal with it or what to </p>
 <p>think of it."</p>
 <p>"There is only one thing for you to do," he retorted. "See the assemblage point! It isn't </p>
 <p>that difficult to see. The difficulty is in breaking the retaining wall we all have in our </p>
 <p>minds that holds us in place. To break it, all we need is energy. Once we have energy, </p>
 <p>seeing happens to us by itself. The trick is in abandoning our fort of self-complacency </p>
 <p>and false security</p>
 <p>"It is obvious to me, don Juan, that it takes a lot of knowledge to see. It isn't just a matter </p>
 <p>of having energy."</p>
 <p>"It is just a matter of having energy, believe me. The hard part is convincing yourself that </p>
 <p>it can be done. For this, you need to trust the nagual. The marvel of sorcery is that every </p>
 <p>sorcerer has to prove everything with his own experience. I am telling you about the </p>
 <p>principles of sorcery not with the hope that you will memorize them but with the hope </p>
 <p>that you will practice them."</p>
 <p>Don Juan was certainly right about the need for trusting. In the beginning stages of my </p>
 <p>thirteen-year apprenticeship with him, the hardest thing for me was to affiliate myself </p>
 <p>with his world and his person. This affiliating meant that I had to learn to trust him </p>
 <p>implicitly and accept him without bias as the nagual.</p>
 <p>Don Juan's total role in the sorcerers' world was synthesized in the title accorded to him </p>
 <p>by his peers; he was called the nagual. It was explained to me that this concept refers to </p>
 <p>any person, male or female, who possesses a specific kind of energy configuration, which </p>
 <p>to a seer appears as a double luminous ball. Seers believe that when one of these people </p>
 <p>enters into the sorcerers' world, that extra load of energy is turned into a measure of </p>
 <p>strength and the capacity for leader ship. Thus, the nagual is the natural guide, the leader </p>
 <p>of a party of sorcerers.</p>
 <p>At first, to feel such a trust for don Juan was quite disturbing to me, if not altogether </p>
 <p>odious. When I discussed it with him, he assured me that to trust his teacher in such a </p>
 <p>manner had been just as difficult for him.</p>
 <p>"I told my teacher the same thing you are saying to me now," don Juan said. "He replied </p>
 <p>that without trusting the nagual there is no possibility of relief and thus no possibility of </p>
 <p>clearing the debris from our lives in order to be free."</p>
 <p>Don Juan reiterated how right his teacher had been. And I reiterated my profound </p>
 <p>disagreement. I told him that being reared in a stifling religious environment had had </p>
 <p>dreadful effects on me, and that his teacher's statements and his own acquiescence to his </p>
 <p>teacher reminded me of the obedience dogma that I had to learn as a child and that I </p>
 <p>abhorred. "It sounds like you're voicing a religious belief when you talk about the </p>
 <p>nagual," I said.</p>
 <p>"You may believe whatever you want," don Juan replied undaunted1y. "The fact </p>
 <p>remains, there is no game without the nagual. I know this and I say so. And so did all the </p>
 <p>naguals who preceded me. But they didn't say it from the standpoint of self-importance, </p>
 <p>and neither do I. TO say there is no path with out the nagual is to refer totally to the fact </p>
 <p>that the man, the nagual, is a nagual because he can reflect the abstract, the spirit, better </p>
 <p>than others. But that's all. Our link is with the spirit itself and only incidentally with the </p>
 <p>man who brings us its message."</p>
 <p>I did learn to trust don Juan implicitly as the nagual, and this, as he had stated it, brought </p>
 <p>me an immense sense of relief and a greater capacity to accept what he was striving to </p>
 <p>teach me.</p>
 <p>In his teachings, he put a great emphasis on explaining and discussing the assemblage </p>
 <p>point. I asked him once if the assemblage point had anything to do with the physical </p>
 <p>body.</p>
 <p>"It has nothing to do with what we normally perceive as the body," he said. "It's part of </p>
 <p>the luminous egg, which is our energy self."</p>
 <p>"How is it displaced?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Through energy currents. Jolts of energy, originating outside or inside our energy shape. </p>
 <p>These are usually unpredictable currents that happen randomly, but with sorcerers they </p>
 <p>are very predictable currents that obey the sorcerer's intent."</p>
 <p>"Can you yourself feel these currents?"</p>
 <p>"Every sorcerer feels them. Every human being does, for that matter, but average human </p>
 <p>beings are too busy with their own pursuits to pay any attention to feelings like that."</p>
 <p>"What do those currents feel like?"</p>
 <p>"Like a mild discomfort, a vague sensation of sadness followed immediately by euphoria. </p>
 <p>Since neither the sadness nor the euphoria has an explainable cause, we never regard </p>
 <p>them as veritable onslaughts of the unknown but as unexplainable, 'ill founded </p>
 <p>moodiness."</p>
 <p> "What happens when the assemblage point moves outside the energy shape? Does it </p>
 <p>hang outside? Or is it attached to the luminous ball?"</p>
 <p>"It pushes the contours of the energy shape out, without breaking its energy boundaries."</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that the end result of a movement of the assemblage point is a total </p>
 <p>change in the energy shape of a human being. Instead of a ball or an egg, he becomes </p>
 <p>some thing resembling a smoking pipe. The tip of the stem is the assemblage, point, and </p>
 <p>the bowl of the pipe is what remains of the luminous ball. If the assemblage point keeps </p>
 <p>on moving, a moment comes when the luminous ball becomes a thin line of energy</p>
 <p>Don Juan went on to explain that the old sorcerers were the only ones who accomplished </p>
 <p>this feat of energy shape transformation. And I asked him whether in their new energetic </p>
 <p>shape those sorcerers were still men.</p>
 <p>"Of course they were still men," he said. "But I think what you want to know is if they </p>
 <p>were still men of reason, trustworthy persons. Well, not quite."</p>
 <p>"In what way were they different?"</p>
 <p>"In their concerns. Human endeavors and preoccupations had no meaning whatsoever to </p>
 <p>them. They also had a definite new appearance."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean that they didn't look like men?"</p>
 <p>"It's very hard to tell what was what about those sorcerers. They certainly looked like </p>
 <p>men. What else would they look like? But they were not quite like what you or I would </p>
 <p>expect. Yet if you pressed me to tell in what way they were different, I would go in </p>
 <p>circles, like a dog chasing its tail."</p>
 <p>"Have you ever met one of those men, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, I have met one."</p>
 <p>"What did he look like?"</p>
 <p>"As far as looks, he looked like a regular person. Now, it was his behavior that was </p>
 <p>unusual."</p>
 <p>"In what way was it unusual?"</p>
 <p>"All I can tell you is that the behavior of the sorcerer I met is something that defies the </p>
 <p>imagination. But to make it a matter of merely behavior is misleading. It is really </p>
 <p>something 'you must see to appreciate."</p>
 <p>"Were all those sorcerers like the one you met?"</p>
 <p>"Certainly not. I don't know how the others were, except through sorcerers' stories </p>
 <p>handed down from generation to generation. And those stories portray them as being </p>
 <p>quite bizarre."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean monstrous?"</p>
 <p>"Not at all. They say that they were very likable but extremely scary They were more like </p>
 <p>unknown creatures. What makes mankind homogeneous is the fact that we are all </p>
 <p>luminous balls. And those sorcerers were no longer balls of energy but lines of energy </p>
 <p>that were trying to bend themselves into circles, which they couldn't quite make."</p>
 <p>"What finally happened to them, don Juan? Did they die?"</p>
 <p>"Sorcerers' stories say that because they had succeeded in stretching their shapes, they </p>
 <p>had also succeeded in stretching the duration of their consciousness. So they are alive and </p>
 <p>conscious to this day. There are stories about their periodic appearances on the earth."</p>
 <p>"What do you think of all this yourself, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"It is too bizarre for me. I want freedom. Freedom to retain my awareness and yet </p>
 <p>disappear into the vastness. In my personal opinion, those old sorcerers were extravagant, </p>
 <p>obsessive, capricious men who got pinned down by their own machinations.</p>
 <p>"But don't let my personal feelings sway you. The old sorcerers' accomplishment is </p>
 <p>unparalleled. If nothing else, they proved to us that man's potentials are nothing to sneeze </p>
 <p>at."</p>
 <p>Another topic of don Juan's explanations was the indispensability of energetic uniformity </p>
 <p>and cohesion for the purpose of perceiving. His contention was that mankind perceives </p>
 <p>the world we know, in the terms we do, only because we share energetic uniformity and </p>
 <p>cohesion. He said that we automatically attain these two conditions of energy in the </p>
 <p>course of our rearing and that they are so taken for granted we do not realize their vital </p>
 <p>importance until we are faced with the possibility of perceiving worlds other than the </p>
 <p>world we know. At those moments, it becomes evident that we need a new appropriate </p>
 <p>energetic uniformity and cohesion to perceive coherently and totally.</p>
 <p>I asked him what uniformity and cohesion were, and he explained that man's energetic </p>
 <p>shape has uniformity in the sense that every human being on earth has the form of a ball </p>
 <p>or an egg. And the fact that man's energy holds itself together as a ball or an egg proves it </p>
 <p>has cohesion. He said that an example of a new uniformity and cohesion was the old </p>
 <p>sorcerers' energetic shape when it became a line: every one of them uniformly became a </p>
 <p>line and cohesively remained a line. Uniformity and cohesion at a line level permitted </p>
 <p>those old sorcerers to perceive a homogeneous new world.</p>
 <p>"How are uniformity and cohesion acquired?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"The key is the position of the assemblage point, or rather the fixation of the assemblage </p>
 <p>point," he said.</p>
 <p>He did not want to elaborate any further at that time, so I asked him if those old sorcerers </p>
 <p>could have reverted to being egglike. He replied that at one point they could have, but </p>
 <p>that they did not. And then the line cohesion set in and made it impossible for them to go </p>
 <p>back. He believed that what really crystallized that line cohesion and prevented them </p>
 <p>from making the journey back was a matter of choice and greed. The scope of what those </p>
 <p>sorcerers were able to perceive and do as lines of energy was astronomically greater than </p>
 <p>what an aver age man or any average sorcerer can do or perceive.</p>
 <p>He explained that the human domain when one is an energy ball is whatever energy </p>
 <p>filaments pass through the space within the ball's boundaries. Normally, we perceive not </p>
 <p>all the</p>
 <p>human domain but perhaps only one thousandth of it. He was of the opinion that, if we </p>
 <p>take this into consideration, the enormity of what the old sorcerers did becomes apparent; </p>
 <p>they extended themselves into a line a thousand times the size of a man as an energy ball </p>
 <p>and perceived all the energy filaments that passed through that line.</p>
 <p>On his insistence, I made giant efforts to understand the new model of energy </p>
 <p>configuration he was outlining for me. Finally, after much pounding, I could follow the </p>
 <p>idea of energy filaments inside the luminous ball and outside it. But if I thought of a </p>
 <p>multitude of luminous balls, the model broke down in my mind. In a multitude of </p>
 <p>luminous balls, I reasoned, the energy filaments that are outside one of them will perforce </p>
 <p>be inside the adjacent one. So in a multitude there could not possibly be any energy </p>
 <p>filaments outside any luminous ball.</p>
 <p>"To understand all this certainly isn't an exercise for your reason," he replied after </p>
 <p>carefully listening to my arguments. "I have no way of explaining what sorcerers mean </p>
 <p>by filaments inside and outside the human shape. When seers see the human energy </p>
 <p>shape, they see one single ball of energy. If there is another ball next to it, the other ball is </p>
 <p>seen again as a single ball of energy. The idea of a multitude of luminous balls comes </p>
 <p>from your knowledge of human crowds. In the universe of energy, there are only single </p>
 <p>individuals, alone, surrounded by the boundless.</p>
 <p>"You must see that for yourself!"</p>
 <p>I argued with don Juan then that it was pointless to tell me to see it for myself when he </p>
 <p>knew I could not. And he proposed that I borrow his energy and use it to see.</p>
 <p>"How can I do that? Borrow your energy."</p>
 <p>"Very simple. I can make your assemblage point shift to another position more suitable to </p>
 <p>perceiving energy directly."</p>
 <p>This was the first time, in my memory, that he deliberately talked about something he had </p>
 <p>been doing all along: making me enter into some incomprehensible state of awareness </p>
 <p>that defied my idea of the world and of myself, a state he called the second attention. So, </p>
 <p>to make my assemblage point shift to a position more suitable to perceiving energy </p>
 <p>directly, don Juan slapped my back, between my shoulder blades, with such a force that </p>
 <p>he made me lose my breath. I thought that I must have fainted or that the blow had made </p>
 <p>me fall asleep. Suddenly, I was looking or I was dreaming I was looking at some thing </p>
 <p>literally beyond words. Bright strings of light shot out from everywhere, going </p>
 <p>everywhere, strings of light which were like nothing that had ever entered my thoughts.</p>
 <p>When I recovered my breath, or when I woke up, don Juan expectantly asked me, "What </p>
 <p>did you see?" And when, I answered, truthfully, "Your blow made me see stars," he </p>
 <p>doubled up laughing.</p>
 <p>He remarked that I was not ready yet to comprehend any unusual perception I might have </p>
 <p>had. "I made your assemblage point shift," he went on, "and for an instant you were </p>
 <p>dreaming the filaments of the universe. But you don't yet have the discipline or the </p>
 <p>energy to rearrange your uniformity and cohesion. The old sorcerers were the </p>
 <p>consummate masters of that rearranging. That was how they saw everything that can be </p>
 <p>seen by man."</p>
 <p>"What does it mean to rearrange uniformity and cohesion?"</p>
 <p>"It means to enter into the second attention by retaining the assemblage point on its new </p>
 <p>position and keeping it from sliding back to its original spot."</p>
 <p>Don Juan then gave me a traditional definition of the second attention. He said that the </p>
 <p>old sorcerers called the result of fixing the assemblage point on new positions the second </p>
 <p>attention and that they treated the second attention as an area 9 all- inclusive activity just </p>
 <p>as the attention of the daily world is. He pointed out that sorcerers really have two </p>
 <p>complete areas for their endeavors: a small one, called the first attention or the awareness </p>
 <p>of our daily world or the fixation of the assemblage point on its habitual position; and a </p>
 <p>much larger area, the second attention or the awareness of other worlds or the fixation of </p>
 <p>the assemblage point on each of an enormous number of new positions.</p>
 <p>Don Juan helped me to experience inexplicable things in the second attention by means </p>
 <p>of what he called a sorcerer's maneuver: tapping my back gently or forcefully striking it </p>
 <p>at the height of my shoulder blades. He explained that with his blows he displaced my </p>
 <p>assemblage point. From my experiential position, such displacements meant that my </p>
 <p>awareness used to enter into a most disturbing state of unequaled clarity, a state of </p>
 <p>superconsciousness, which I enjoyed for short periods of time and in which I could </p>
 <p>understand anything with minimal pre ambles. It was not quite a pleasing state. Most of </p>
 <p>the time it was like a strange dream, so intense that normal awareness paled by </p>
 <p>comparison.</p>
 <p>Don Juan justified the indispensability of such a maneuver, saying that in normal </p>
 <p>awareness a sorcerer teaches his apprentices basic concepts and procedures and in the </p>
 <p>second attention he gives them abstract and detailed explanations.</p>
 <p>Ordinarily, apprentices do not remember these explanations at all, yet they somehow </p>
 <p>store them, faithfully intact, in their memories. Sorcerers have used this seeming </p>
 <p>peculiarity of memory and have turned remembering everything that hap pens to them in </p>
 <p>the second attention into one of the most difficult and complex traditional tasks of </p>
 <p>sorcery.</p>
 <p>Sorcerers explain this seeming peculiarity of memory, and the task of remembering, </p>
 <p>saying that every time anyone enters into the second attention, the assemblage point is on </p>
 <p>a different position. To remember, then, means to relocate the assemblage point on the </p>
 <p>exact position it occupied at the time those entrances into the second attention occurred. </p>
 <p>Don Juan assured me not only that sorcerers have total and absolute recall but that they </p>
 <p>relive every experience they had in the second attention by this act of returning their </p>
 <p>assemblage point to each of those specific positions. He also assured me that sorcerers </p>
 <p>dedicate a lifetime to fulfilling this task of remembering.</p>
 <p>In the second attention, don Juan gave me very detailed explanations of sorcery, knowing </p>
 <p>that the accuracy and fidelity of such instruction will remain with me, faithfully intact, for </p>
 <p>the duration of my life.</p>
 <p>About this quality of faithfulness he said, "Learning some thing in the second attention is </p>
 <p>just like learning when we were children. What we learn remains with us for life. 'It's </p>
 <p>second nature with me,' we say when it comes to something we've learned very early in </p>
 <p>life."</p>
 <p>Judging from where I stand today, I realize that don Juan made me enter, as many times </p>
 <p>as he could, into the second attention in order to force me to sustain, for long periods of </p>
 <p>time, new positions of my assemblage point and to perceive coherently in them, that is to </p>
 <p>say, he aimed at forcing me to rearrange my uniformity and cohesion.</p>
 <p>I succeeded countless times in perceiving everything as precisely as I perceive in the </p>
 <p>daily world. My problem was my incapacity to make a bridge between my actions in the </p>
 <p>second attention and my awareness of the daily world. It took a great deal of effort and </p>
 <p>time for me to understand what the second attention is. Not so much because of its </p>
 <p>intricacy and complexity, which are indeed extreme, but because, once I was back in my </p>
 <p>normal awareness, I found it impossible to remember not only that I had entered into the </p>
 <p>second attention but that such a state existed at all.</p>
 <p>Another monumental breakthrough that the old sorcerers claimed, and that don Juan </p>
 <p>carefully explained to me, was to find out that the assemblage point becomes very easily </p>
 <p>displaced during sleep. This realization triggered another one:</p>
 <p>that dreams are totally associated with that displacement. The old sorcerers saw that the </p>
 <p>greater the displacement, the more unusual the dream or vice versa: the more unusual the </p>
 <p>dream, the greater the displacement. Don Juan said that this observation led them to </p>
 <p>devise extravagant techniques to force the displacement of the assemblage point, such as </p>
 <p>ingesting plants that can produce altered states of consciousness; subjecting themselves to </p>
 <p>states of hunger, fatigue, and stress; and especially controlling dreams. In this fashion, </p>
 <p>and perhaps without even knowing it, they created dreaming.</p>
 <p>One day, as we strolled around the plaza in the city of Oaxaca, don Juan gave me the </p>
 <p>most coherent definition of dreaming from a sorcerer's standpoint.</p>
 <p>"Sorcerers view dreaming as an extremely sophisticated art," he said, "the art of </p>
 <p>displacing the assemblage point at will from its habitual position in order to enhance and </p>
 <p>enlarge the scope of what can be perceived."</p>
 <p>He said that the old sorcerers anchored the art of dreaming on five conditions they saw in </p>
 <p>the energy flow of human beings.</p>
 <p>One, they saw that only, the energy filaments that pass directly through the assemblage </p>
 <p>point can be assembled into coherent perception.</p>
 <p>Two, they saw that if the assemblage point is displaced to another position, no matter </p>
 <p>how minute the displacement, different and unaccustomed energy filaments begin to pass </p>
 <p>through it, engaging awareness and forcing the assembling of these unaccustomed energy </p>
 <p>fields into a steady, coherent perception.</p>
 <p>Three, they saw that, in the course of ordinary dreams, the assemblage point becomes </p>
 <p>easily displaced by itself to another position on the surface or in the interior of the </p>
 <p>luminous egg.</p>
 <p>Four, they saw that the assemblage point can be made to move to positions outside the </p>
 <p>luminous egg, into the energy filaments of the universe at large.</p>
 <p>And, five, they saw that through discipline it is possible to cultivate and perform, in the </p>
 <p>course Of sleep and ordinary dreams, a systematic displacement of the assemblage point.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 2</p>
 <p>THE FIRST GATE OF DREAMING</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>As a preamble to his first lesson in dreaming, don Juan talked about the second attention </p>
 <p>as a progression: beginning as an idea that comes to us more like a curiosity than an </p>
 <p>actual possibility; turning into something that can only be felt, as a sensation is felt; and </p>
 <p>finally evolving into a state of being, or a realm of practicalities, or a preeminent force </p>
 <p>that opens for us worlds beyond our wildest fantasies.</p>
 <p>When explaining sorcery; sorcerers have two options. One is to speak in metaphorical </p>
 <p>terms and talk about a world of magi cal dimensions. The other is to explain their </p>
 <p>business in abstract terms proper to sorcery. I have always preferred the</p>
 <p>latter, although neither option will ever satisfy the rational mind of a Western man.</p>
 <p>Don Juan told me that what he meant by his metaphorical description of the second </p>
 <p>attention as a progression was that, being a by-pr9duct of a displacement of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point, the second attention does not happen naturally but must be intended, </p>
 <p>beginning with intending it as an idea and ending up with intending it as a steady and </p>
 <p>controlled awareness of the assemblage point's displacement.</p>
 <p>"I am going to teach you the first step to power," don Juan said, beginning his instruction </p>
 <p>in the art of dreaming. "I'm going to teach you how to set up dreaming."</p>
 <p>"What does it mean to set up dreaming?"</p>
 <p>"To set up dreaming means to have a precise and practical command over the general </p>
 <p>situation of a dream. For example, you may dream that you are in your classroom. To set </p>
 <p>up dreaming means that you don't let the dream slip into some thing else. You don't </p>
 <p>jump from the classroom to the mountains, for instance. In other words, you control the </p>
 <p>view of the classroom and don't let it go until you want to."</p>
 <p>"But is it possible to do that?"</p>
 <p>"Of course it's possible. This control is no different from the control we have over any </p>
 <p>situation in our daily lives. Sorcerers are used to it and get it every time they want or need </p>
 <p>to. In order to get used to it yourself, you must start by doing some thing very simple. </p>
 <p>Tonight, in your dreams, you must look at your hands."</p>
 <p>Not much more was said about this in the awareness of our daily world. In my </p>
 <p>recollection of my experiences in the second attention, however, I found out that we had </p>
 <p>a more extensive exchange. For instance, I expressed my feelings about the absurdity of </p>
 <p>the task, and don Juan suggested that I should face it in terms of a quest that was </p>
 <p>entertaining, instead of solemn and morbid.</p>
 <p>"Get as heavy as you want when we talk about dreaming,"</p>
 <p>he said. "Explanations always call for deep thought. But when you actually dream, be as </p>
 <p>light as a feather. Dreaming has to be performed with integrity and seriousness, but in the </p>
 <p>midst of laughter and with the confidence of someone who doesn't have a worry in the </p>
 <p>world. Only under these conditions can our dreams actually be turned into dreaming."</p>
 <p>Don Juan assured me that he had selected my hands arbitrarily as something to look for in </p>
 <p>my dreams and that looking for anything else was just as valid. The goal of the exercise </p>
 <p>was not finding a specific thing but engaging my dreaming attention.</p>
 <p>Don Juan described the dreaming attention as the control one acquires over one's dreams </p>
 <p>upon fixating the assemblage point on any new position to which it has been displaced </p>
 <p>during dreams. In more general terms, he called the dreaming attention an </p>
 <p>incomprehensible facet of awareness that exists by itself, waiting for a moment when we </p>
 <p>would entice it, a moment when we would give it purpose; it is a veiled faculty that every </p>
 <p>one of us has in reserve but never has the opportunity to use in everyday life.</p>
 <p>My first attempts at looking for my hands in my dreams were a fiasco. After months of </p>
 <p>unsuccessful efforts, I gave up and complained to don Juan again about the absurdity of </p>
 <p>such a task.</p>
 <p>"There are seven gates," he said as a way of answering, "and dreamers have to open all </p>
 <p>seven of them, one at the time. You're up against the first gate that must be opened if you </p>
 <p>are to dream."</p>
 <p>"Why didn't you tell me this before?"</p>
 <p>"It would've been useless to tell you about the gates of dreaming before you smacked </p>
 <p>your head against the first one. Now you know that it is an obstacle and that you have to </p>
 <p>over come it."</p>
 <p>Don Juan -explained that there are entrances and exits in the energy flow of the universe </p>
 <p>and that, in the specific case of dreaming, there are seven entrances, experienced as </p>
 <p>obstacles, which sorcerers call the seven gates of dreaming.</p>
 <p>"The first gate is a threshold we must cross by becoming aware of a particular sensation </p>
 <p>before deep sleep," he said. "A sensation which is like a pleasant heaviness that doesn't </p>
 <p>let us open our eyes. We reach that gate the instant we become aware that we're falling </p>
 <p>asleep, suspended in darkness and heaviness."</p>
 <p>"How do I become aware that I am falling asleep? Are there any steps to follow?" -</p>
 <p>"No. There are no steps to follow. One just intends to become aware of falling asleep."</p>
 <p>"But how does one intend to become aware of it?"</p>
 <p>"Intent or intending is something very difficult to talk about. I or anyone else would </p>
 <p>sound idiotic trying to explain it. Bear that in mind when you hear what I have to say </p>
 <p>next: sorcerers intend anything they set themselves to intend, simply by intending it."</p>
 <p>"That doesn't mean anything, don Juan."</p>
 <p>"Pay close attention. Someday it'll be your turn to explain. The statement seems </p>
 <p>nonsensical because you are not putting it in the proper context. Like any rational man, </p>
 <p>you think that understanding is exclusively the realm of our reason, of our mind.</p>
 <p>"For sorcerers, because the statement I made pertains to intent and intending, </p>
 <p>understanding it pertains to the realm of energy. Sorcerers believe that if one would </p>
 <p>intend that statement for the energy body, the energy body would understand it in terms </p>
 <p>entirely different from those of the mind. The trick is to reach the energy body. For that </p>
 <p>you need energy."</p>
 <p>"In what terms would the energy body understand that statement, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"In terms of a bodily feeling, which it's hard to describe. You'll have to experience it to </p>
 <p>know what I mean."</p>
 <p>I wanted a more precise explanation, but don Juan slapped my back and made me enter </p>
 <p>into the second attention. At that time, what he did was still utterly mysterious to me. I </p>
 <p>could have sworn that his touch hypnotized me. I believed he had instantaneously put me </p>
 <p>to sleep, and I dreamt that I found myself walking with him on a wide avenue lined with </p>
 <p>trees in some unknown city It was such a vivid dream, and I was so aware of everything, </p>
 <p>that I immediately tried to orient myself by reading signs and looking at people. It </p>
 <p>definitely was not an English- or Spanish-speaking city but it was a Western city. The </p>
 <p>people seemed to be northern Europeans, perhaps Lithuanians. I became absorbed in </p>
 <p>trying to read billboards and street signs.</p>
 <p>Don Juan nudged me gently. "Don't bother with that," he said. "We are nowhere </p>
 <p>identifiable. I've just lent you my energy so you would reach your energy body, and with </p>
 <p>it you've just crossed into another world. This won't last long, so use your time wisely.</p>
 <p>"Look at everything, but without being obvious. Don't let anyone notice you."</p>
 <p>We walked in silence. It was a block-long walk, which had a remarkable effect on me. </p>
 <p>The more we walked, the greater my sensation of visceral anxiety My mind was curious, </p>
 <p>but my body was alarmed. I had the clearest understanding that I was not in this world. </p>
 <p>When we got to an intersection and stopped walking, I saw that the trees on the street had </p>
 <p>been carefully trimmed. They were short trees with hard-looking, curled leaves. Each tree </p>
 <p>had a big square space for watering. There were no weeds or trash in those spaces, as one </p>
 <p>would find around trees in the city, only charcoal black, loose dirt.</p>
 <p>The moment I focused my eyes on the curb, before I stepped off it to cross the street, I </p>
 <p>noticed that there were no cars. I tried desperately to watch the people who milled around </p>
 <p>us, to discover something about them that would explain my anxiety. As I stared at them, </p>
 <p>they stared back at me. In one instant a circle of hard blue and brown eyes had formed </p>
 <p>around us.</p>
 <p>A certainty hit me like a blow: this was not a dream at all; we were in a reality beyond </p>
 <p>what I know to be real. I turned to face don Juan. I was about to realize what was </p>
 <p>different about those</p>
 <p>people, but a strange dry wind that went directly to my sinuses hit my face, blurred my </p>
 <p>view, and made me forget what I wanted to tell don Juan. The next instant, I was back </p>
 <p>where I had started from: don Juan's house. I was lying on a straw mat, curled up on my </p>
 <p>side.</p>
 <p>"I lent you my energy, and you reached your energy body," don Juan said matter-of-</p>
 <p>factly.</p>
 <p>I heard him talk, but I was numb. An unusual itching on my solar plexus kept my breaths </p>
 <p>short and painful. I knew that I had been on the verge of finding something </p>
 <p>transcendental about dreaming and about the people I had seen, yet I could not bring </p>
 <p>whatever I knew into focus.</p>
 <p>"Where were we, don Juan?" I asked. "Was it all a dream? A hypnotic state?"</p>
 <p>"It wasn't a dream," he replied. "It was dreaming. I helped you reach the second attention </p>
 <p>so that you would understand intending as a subject not for your reason but for your </p>
 <p>energy body.</p>
 <p>"At this point, you can't yet comprehend the import of all this, not only because you </p>
 <p>don't have sufficient energy but because you're not intending anything. If you were, your </p>
 <p>energy body would comprehend immediately that the only way to intend is by focusing </p>
 <p>your intent on whatever you want to intend. This time I focused it for you on reaching </p>
 <p>your energy body."</p>
 <p>"Is the goal of dreaming to intend the energy body?" I asked, suddenly empowered by </p>
 <p>some strange reasoning.</p>
 <p>"One can certainly put it that way," he said. "In this particular instance, since we're </p>
 <p>talking about the first gate of dreaming, the goal of dreaming is to intend that your energy </p>
 <p>body becomes aware that you are falling asleep. Don't try to force yourself to be aware of </p>
 <p>falling asleep. Let your energy body do it. To intend is to wish without wishing, to do </p>
 <p>without doing.</p>
 <p>"Accept the challenge of intending," he went on. "Put your silent determination, without </p>
 <p>a single thought, into convincing yourself that you have reached your energy body and </p>
 <p>that you are a dreamer. Doing this will automatically put you in the position to be aware </p>
 <p>that you are falling asleep."</p>
 <p>"How can I convince myself that I am a dreamer when I am not?"</p>
 <p>"When you hear that you have to convince yourself, you automatically become more </p>
 <p>rational. How can you convince yourself you are a dreamer when you know you are not? </p>
 <p>Intending is both: the act of convincing yourself you are indeed a dreamer, although you </p>
 <p>have never dreamt before, and the act of being convinced."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean I have to tell myself I am a dreamer and try my best to believe it? Is that </p>
 <p>it?"</p>
 <p>"No, it isn't. Intending is much simpler and, at the same time, infinitely more complex </p>
 <p>than that. It requires imagination, discipline, and purpose. In this case, to intend means </p>
 <p>that you get an unquestionable bodily knowledge that you are a dreamer. You feel you </p>
 <p>are a dreamer with all the cells of your body."</p>
 <p>Don Juan added in a joking tone that he did not have sufficient energy to make me </p>
 <p>another loan for intending and that the thing to do was to reach my energy body on my </p>
 <p>own. He assured me that intending the first gate of dreaming was one of the means </p>
 <p>discovered by the sorcerers of antiquity for reaching the second attention and the energy </p>
 <p>body.</p>
 <p>After telling me this, he practically threw me out of his house, commanding me not to </p>
 <p>come back until I had intended the first gate of dreaming.</p>
 <p>I returned home, and every night for months I went to sleep intending with all my might </p>
 <p>to become aware that I was falling asleep and to see my hands in my dreams. The other </p>
 <p>part of the task-to convince myself that I was a dreamer and that I had reached my </p>
 <p>energy body-was totally impossible for me.</p>
 <p>Then, one afternoon while taking a nap, I dreamt I was looking at my hands. The shock </p>
 <p>was enough to wake me up. It</p>
 <p>proved to be a unique dream that could not be repeated. Weeks went by, and I was unable </p>
 <p>either to become aware that I was falling asleep or to find my hands. I began to notice, </p>
 <p>however, that I was having in my dreams a vague feeling that there was something I </p>
 <p>should have been doing but could not remember. This feeling became so strong that it </p>
 <p>kept on waking me up at all hours of the night.</p>
 <p>When I told don Juan about my futile attempts to cross the first gate of dreaming, he gave </p>
 <p>me some guidelines. "To ask a dreamer to find a determined item in his dreams is a </p>
 <p>subterfuge," he said. "The real issue is to become aware that one is falling asleep. And, </p>
 <p>strange as it may seem, that doesn't happen by commanding oneself to be aware that one </p>
 <p>is falling asleep but by sustaining the sight of whatever one is looking at in a dream."</p>
 <p>He told me that dreamers take quick, deliberate glances at everything present in a dream. </p>
 <p>If they focus their dreaming attention on something specific, it is only as a point of </p>
 <p>departure. From there, dreamers move on to look at other items in the dream's content, </p>
 <p>returning to the point of departure as many times as possible.</p>
 <p>After a great effort, I indeed found hands in my dreams, but they never were mine. They </p>
 <p>were hands that only seemed to belong to me, hands that changed shape, becoming quite </p>
 <p>nightmarish at times. The rest of my dreams' content, nonetheless, was always pleasantly </p>
 <p>steady. I could almost sustain the view of anything I focused my attention on.</p>
 <p>It went on like this for months, until one day when my capacity to dream changed </p>
 <p>seemingly by itself. I had done nothing special besides my constant earnest determination </p>
 <p>to be aware that I was falling asleep and to find my hands.</p>
 <p>I dreamt I was visiting my hometown. Not that the town I was dreaming about looked at </p>
 <p>all like my hometown, but somehow I had the conviction that it was the place where I </p>
 <p>was born. It all began as an ordinary, yet very vivid dream. Then the light in the dream </p>
 <p>changed. Images became sharper. The street where I was walking became noticeably </p>
 <p>more real than a moment before. My feet began to hurt. I could feel that things were </p>
 <p>absurdly hard. For instance, on bumping into a door, not only did I experience pain on the </p>
 <p>knee that hit the door but I also was enraged by my clumsiness.</p>
 <p>I realistically walked in that town until I was completely exhausted. I saw everything I </p>
 <p>could have seen had I been a tourist walking through the streets of a city. And there was </p>
 <p>no difference whatsoever between that dream walk and any walk I had actually taken on </p>
 <p>the streets of a city I visited for the first time.</p>
 <p>"I think you went a bit too far," don Juan said after listening to my account. "All that was </p>
 <p>required was your awareness of falling asleep. What you've done is equivalent to </p>
 <p>bringing a wall down just to squash a mosquito sitting on it."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that I flubbed it?"</p>
 <p>"No. But apparently you're trying to repeat something you did before. When I made your </p>
 <p>assemblage point shift and you and I ended up in that mysterious city. you were not </p>
 <p>asleep. You were dreaming, but not asleep, meaning that your assemblage point didn't </p>
 <p>reach that position through a normal dream. I forced it to shift.</p>
 <p>"You certainly can reach the same position through dreaming, but I wouldn't advise you </p>
 <p>to do that at this time."</p>
 <p>"Is it dangerous?"</p>
 <p>"And how! Dreaming has to be a very sober affair. No false movement can be afforded. </p>
 <p>Dreaming is a process of awakening, of gaining control. Our dreaming attention must be </p>
 <p>systematically exercised, for it is the door to the second attention."</p>
 <p>"What's the difference between the dreaming attention and the second attention?"</p>
 <p>"The second attention is like an ocean, and the dreaming attention is like a river feeding </p>
 <p>into it. The second attention is the condition of being aware of total worlds, total like our</p>
 <p>world is total, while the dreaming attention is the condition of being aware of the items of </p>
 <p>our dreams."</p>
 <p>He heavily stressed that the dreaming attention is the key to every movement in the </p>
 <p>sorcerers' world. He said that among the multitude of items in our dreams, there exist real </p>
 <p>energetic interferences, things that have been put in our dreams extraneously, by an alien </p>
 <p>force. To be able to find them and follow them is sorcery.</p>
 <p>The emphasis he put on those statements was so pronounced that I had to ask him to </p>
 <p>explain them. He hesitated for a moment before answering.</p>
 <p>"Dreams are, if not a door, a hatch into other worlds," he began. "As such, dreams are a </p>
 <p>two-way street. Our awareness goes through that hatch into other realms, and those other </p>
 <p>realms send scouts into our dreams."</p>
 <p>"What are those scouts?"</p>
 <p>"Energy charges that get mixed with the items of our normal dreams. They are bursts of </p>
 <p>foreign energy that come into our dreams, and we interpret them as items familiar or </p>
 <p>unfamiliar to us."</p>
 <p>"I am sorry, don Juan, but I can't make heads or tails out of your explanation."</p>
 <p>"You can't because you're insisting on thinking about dreams in terms known to you: </p>
 <p>what occurs to us during sleep. And I am insisting on giving you another version: a hatch </p>
 <p>into other realms of perception. Through that hatch, currents of unfamiliar energy seep in. </p>
 <p>Then the mind or the brain or whatever takes those currents of energy and turns them into </p>
 <p>parts of our dreams."</p>
 <p>He paused, obviously to give my mind time to take in what he was telling me. "Sorcerers </p>
 <p>are aware of those currents of foreign energy," he continued. "They notice them and </p>
 <p>strive to isolate them from the normal items of their dreams."</p>
 <p>"Why do they isolate them, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Because they come from other realms. If we follow them to their source, they serve us </p>
 <p>as guides into areas of such mystery that sorcerers shiver at the mere mention of such a </p>
 <p>possibility."</p>
 <p>"How do sorcerers isolate them from the normal items of their dreams?"</p>
 <p>"By the exercise and control of their dreaming attention. At one moment, our dreaming </p>
 <p>attention discovers them among the items of a dream and focuses on them, then the total </p>
 <p>dream collapses, leaving only the foreign energy"</p>
 <p>Don Juan refused to explain the topic any further. He went back to discussing my </p>
 <p>dreaming experience and said that, all in all, he had to take my dream as being my first </p>
 <p>genuine attempt at dreaming, and that this meant I had succeeded in reaching the first </p>
 <p>gate of dreaming.</p>
 <p>During another discussion, at a different time, he abruptly brought up the subject again. </p>
 <p>He said, "I'm going to repeat what you must do in your dreams in order to pass the first </p>
 <p>gate of dreaming. First you must focus your gaze on anything of your choice as the </p>
 <p>starting point. Then shift your gaze to other items and look at them in brief glances. </p>
 <p>Focus your gaze on as many things as you can. Remember that if you glance only briefly, </p>
 <p>the images don't shift. Then go back to the item you first looked at."</p>
 <p>"What does it mean to pass the first gate of dreaming?"</p>
 <p>"We reach the first gate of dreaming by becoming aware that we are falling asleep, or by </p>
 <p>having, like you did, a gigantically real dream. Once we reach the gate, we must cross it </p>
 <p>by being able to sustain the sight of any item of our dreams."</p>
 <p>"I can almost look steadily at the items of my dreams, but they dissipate too quickly."</p>
 <p>"This is precisely what I am trying to tell you. In order to off set the evanescent quality of </p>
 <p>dreams, sorcerers have devised the use of the starting point item. Every time you isolate it </p>
 <p>and look at it, you get a surge of energy, so at the beginning don't look at too many </p>
 <p>things in your dreams. Four items will suffice. Later on, you may enlarge the scope until </p>
 <p>you can cover all you</p>
 <p>want, but as soon as the images begin to shift and you feel you are losing control, go back </p>
 <p>to your starting point item and start all over again."</p>
 <p>"Do you believe that I really reached the first gate of dreaming, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"You did, and that's a lot. You'll find out, as you go along, how easy it'll be to do </p>
 <p>dreaming now."</p>
 <p>I thought don Juan was either exaggerating or giving me incentive. But he assured me he </p>
 <p>was being on the level.</p>
 <p>"The most astounding thing that happens to dreamers," he said, "is that, on reaching the </p>
 <p>first gate, they also reach the energy body."</p>
 <p>"What exactly is the energy body?"</p>
 <p>"It's the counterpart of the physical body. A ghostlike configuration made of pure </p>
 <p>energy"</p>
 <p>"But isn't the physical body also made out of energy?"</p>
 <p>"Of course it is. The difference is that the energy body has only appearance but no mass. </p>
 <p>Since it's pure energy, it can per form acts that are beyond the possibilities of the </p>
 <p>physical body."</p>
 <p>"Such as what for example, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Such as transporting itself in one instant to the ends of the universe. And dreaming is the </p>
 <p>art of tempering the energy body, of making it supple and coherent by gradually </p>
 <p>exercising it.</p>
 <p>"Through dreaming we condense the energy body until it's a unit capable of perceiving. </p>
 <p>Its perception, although affected by our normal way of perceiving the daily world, is an </p>
 <p>independent perception. It has its own sphere."</p>
 <p>"What is that sphere, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Energy; The energy body deals with energy in terms of energy. There are three ways in </p>
 <p>which it deals with energy in dreaming: it can perceive energy as it flows, or it can use </p>
 <p>energy to boost itself like a rocket into unexpected areas, or it can perceive as we </p>
 <p>ordinarily perceive the world."</p>
 <p>"What does it mean to perceive energy as it flows?"</p>
 <p>"It means to see. It means that the energy body sees energy directly as a light or as a </p>
 <p>vibrating current of sorts or as a disturbance. Or it feels it directly as a jolt or as a </p>
 <p>sensation that can even be pain."</p>
 <p>"What about the other way you talked about, don Juan? The energy body using energy as </p>
 <p>a boost."</p>
 <p>"Since energy is its sphere, it is no problem for the energy body to use currents of energy </p>
 <p>that exist in the universe to propel itself. All it has to do is isolate them, and off it goes </p>
 <p>with them."</p>
 <p>He stopped talking and seemed to be undecided, as if he wanted to add something but </p>
 <p>was not sure about it. He smiled at me, and, just as I was beginning to ask him a question, </p>
 <p>he continued his explanation.</p>
 <p>"I've mentioned to you before that sorcerers isolate in their dreams scouts from other </p>
 <p>realms," he said. "Their energy bodies do that. They recognize energy and go for it. But it </p>
 <p>isn't desirable for dreamers to indulge in searching for scouts. I was reluctant to tell you </p>
 <p>about it, because of the facility with which one can get swayed by that search."</p>
 <p>Don Juan then quickly went on to another subject. He care fully outlined for me an entire </p>
 <p>block of practices. At the time, I found that on one level it was all incomprehensible to </p>
 <p>me, yet on another it was perfectly logical and understandable. He reiterated that </p>
 <p>reaching, with deliberate control, the first gate of dreaming is a way of arriving at the </p>
 <p>energy body. But to maintain that gain is predicated on energy alone. Sorcerers get that </p>
 <p>energy by redeploying, in a more intelligent manner, the energy they have and use for </p>
 <p>perceiving the daily world.</p>
 <p>When I urged don Juan to explain it more clearly, he added that we all have a determined </p>
 <p>quantity of basic energy That quantity is all the energy we have, and we use all of it for </p>
 <p>perceiving and dealing with our engulfing world. He repeated various times, to </p>
 <p>emphasize it, that there is no more energy for us anywhere and, since our available </p>
 <p>energy is already engaged,</p>
 <p>there is not a single bit left in us for any extraordinary perception, such as dreaming.</p>
 <p>"Where does that leave us?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"It leaves us to scrounge energy for ourselves, wherever we can find it," he replied.</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that sorcerers have a scrounging method. They intelligently redeploy </p>
 <p>their energy by cutting down any thing they consider superfluous in their lives. They call </p>
 <p>this method the sorcerers' way. In essence, the sorcerers' way, as don Juan put it, is a </p>
 <p>chain of behavioral choices for dealing with the world, choices much more intelligent </p>
 <p>than those our progenitors taught us. These sorcerers' choices are designed to revamp our </p>
 <p>lives by altering our basic reactions about being alive.</p>
 <p>"What are those basic reactions?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"There are two ways of facing our being alive," he said. "One is to surrender to it, either </p>
 <p>by acquiescing to its demands or by fighting those demands. The other is by molding our </p>
 <p>particular life situation to fit our own configurations."</p>
 <p>"Can we really mold our life situation, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"One's particular life situation can be molded to fit one's specifications," don Juan </p>
 <p>insisted. "Dreamers do that. A wild statement? Not really, if you consider how little we </p>
 <p>know about ourselves."</p>
 <p>He said that his interest, as a teacher, was to get me thoroughly involved with the themes </p>
 <p>of life and being alive; that is to say, with the difference between life, as a consequence </p>
 <p>of bio logical forces, and the act of being alive, as a matter of cognition.</p>
 <p>"When sorcerers talk about molding one's life situation," don Juan explained, "they mean </p>
 <p>molding the awareness of being alive. Through molding this awareness, we can get </p>
 <p>enough energy to reach and sustain the energy body, and with it we can certainly mold </p>
 <p>the total direction and consequences of our lives."</p>
 <p>Don Juan ended our conversation about dreaming admonishing me not merely to think </p>
 <p>about what he had told me but to turn his concepts into a viable way of life by a process </p>
 <p>of repetition. He claimed that everything new in our lives, such as the sorcerers' concepts </p>
 <p>he was teaching me, must be repeated to us to the point of exhaustion before we open </p>
 <p>ourselves to it. He pointed out that repetition is the way our progenitors socialized us to </p>
 <p>function in the daily world.</p>
 <p>As I continued my dreaming practices, I gained the capability of being thoroughly aware </p>
 <p>that I was falling asleep as well as the capability of stopping in a dream to examine at will </p>
 <p>anything that was part of that dream's content. To experience this was for me no less than </p>
 <p>miraculous.</p>
 <p>Don Juan stated that as we tighten the control over our dreams, we tighten the mastery </p>
 <p>over our dreaming attention.</p>
 <p>He was right in saying that the dreaming attention comes into play when it is called, </p>
 <p>when it is given a purpose. Its coming into play is not really a process, as one would </p>
 <p>normally understand a process: an ongoing system of operations or a series of actions or </p>
 <p>functions that bring about an end result. It is rather an awakening. Something dormant </p>
 <p>becomes suddenly functional.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 3</p>
 <p>THE SECOND GATE OF DREAMING</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>I found out by means of my dream practices that a dreaming teacher must create a </p>
 <p>didactic synthesis in order to emphasize a given point. In essence, what don Juan wanted </p>
 <p>with my first task was to exercise my dreaming attention by focusing it on the items of </p>
 <p>my dreams. To this effect he used as a spearhead the idea of being aware of falling </p>
 <p>asleep. His subterfuge was to say that the only way to be aware of falling asleep is to </p>
 <p>examine the elements of one's dreams.</p>
 <p>I realized, almost as soon as I had begun my dreaming practices, that exercising the </p>
 <p>dreaming attention is the essential point in dreaming. To the mind, however, it seems </p>
 <p>impossible that one can train oneself to be aware at the level of dreams. Don Juan said </p>
 <p>that the active element of such training is persistence, and that the mind and all its </p>
 <p>rational defenses cannot cope with persistence. Sooner or later, he said, the mind's </p>
 <p>barriers fall, under its impact, and the dreaming attention blooms.</p>
 <p>As I practiced focusing and holding my dreaming attention on the items of my dreams, I </p>
 <p>began to feel a peculiar self-confidence so remarkable that I sought a comment from don </p>
 <p>Juan.</p>
 <p>"It's your entering into the second attention that gives you that sense of self-assurance," </p>
 <p>he said. "This calls for even more sobriety on your part. Go slowly, but don't stop, and </p>
 <p>above all, don't talk about it. Just do it!"</p>
 <p>I told him that in practice I had corroborated what he had already told me, that if one </p>
 <p>takes short glances at everything in a dream, the images do not dissolve. I commented </p>
 <p>that the difficult part is to break the initial barrier that prevents us from bringing dreams </p>
 <p>to our conscious attention. I asked don Juan to give me his opinion on this matter, for I </p>
 <p>earnestly believed that this barrier is a psychological one created by our socialization, </p>
 <p>which puts a premium on disregarding dreams.</p>
 <p>"The barrier is more than socialization," he replied. "It's the first gate of dreaming. Now </p>
 <p>that you've overcome it, it seems stupid to you that we can't stop at will and pay attention </p>
 <p>to the items of our dreams. That's a false certainty. The first gate of dreaming has to do </p>
 <p>with the flow of energy in the universe. It's a natural obstacle."</p>
 <p>Don Juan made me agree then that we would talk about dreaming only in the second </p>
 <p>attention and as he saw fit. He encouraged me to practice in the meantime and promised </p>
 <p>no interference on his part.</p>
 <p>As I gained proficiency in setting up dreaming, I repeatedly experienced sensations that I </p>
 <p>deemed of great importance, such as the feeling that I was rolling into a ditch just as I </p>
 <p>was falling asleep. Don Juan never told me that they were nonsensical sensations but let </p>
 <p>me record them in my notes. I realize now how absurd I must have appeared to him. </p>
 <p>Today, if I were teaching dreaming, I would definitely discourage such a behavior. Don </p>
 <p>Juan merely made fun of me, calling me a covert egomaniac who professed to be fighting </p>
 <p>self-importance yet kept a meticulous, superpersonal diary called "My Dreams."</p>
 <p>Every time he had an opportunity don Juan pointed out that the energy needed to release </p>
 <p>our dreaming attention from its socialization prison comes from redeploying our existing </p>
 <p>energy. Nothing could have been truer. The emergence of our dreaming attention is a </p>
 <p>direct corollary of revamping our lives. Since we have, as don Juan said, no way to plug </p>
 <p>into any external source for a boost of energy, we must redeploy our existing energy, by </p>
 <p>any means available.</p>
 <p>Don Juan insisted that the sorcerers' way is the best means to oil, so to speak, the wheels </p>
 <p>of energy redeployment, and that of all the items in the sorcerers' way, the most effective </p>
 <p>is "losing self-importance." He was thoroughly convinced that this is indispensable for </p>
 <p>everything sorcerers do, and for this reason he put an enormous emphasis on guiding all </p>
 <p>his students to fulfill this requirement. He was of the opinion that self-importance is not </p>
 <p>only the sorcerers' supreme enemy but the nemesis of mankind.</p>
 <p>Don Juan's argument was that most of our energy goes into upholding our importance. </p>
 <p>This is most obvious in our endless worry about the presentation of the self, about </p>
 <p>whether or not we are admired or liked or acknowledged. He reasoned that if we were </p>
 <p>capable of losing some of that importance, two extraordinary things would happen to us. </p>
 <p>One, we would free our energy from trying to maintain the illusory idea of our grandeur; </p>
 <p>and, two, we would provide ourselves with enough energy to enter into the second </p>
 <p>attention to catch a glimpse of the actual grandeur of the universe.</p>
 <p>It took me more than two years to be able to focus my unwavering dreaming attention on </p>
 <p>anything I wanted. And I became SO proficient that I felt as if I had been doing it all my </p>
 <p>life. The eeriest part was that I could not conceive of not having had that ability Yet I </p>
 <p>could remember how difficult it had been even to think of this as a possibility. It occurred </p>
 <p>to me that the capability of examining the contents of one's dreams must be the product </p>
 <p>of a natural configuration of our being, similar per haps to our capability of walking. We </p>
 <p>are physically conditioned to walk only in one manner, bipedally, yet it takes a </p>
 <p>monumental effort for us to learn to walk.</p>
 <p>This new capacity of looking in glances at the items of my dreams was coupled with a </p>
 <p>most insistent nagging to remind myself to look at the elements of my dreams. I knew </p>
 <p>about my compulsive bent of character, but in my dreams my compulsiveness was vastly </p>
 <p>augmented. It became so noticeable that not only did I resent hearing my nagging at </p>
 <p>myself but I also began to question whether it was really my compulsiveness or </p>
 <p>something else. I even thought I was losing my mind.</p>
 <p>"I talk to myself endlessly in my dreams, reminding myself to look at things," I said to </p>
 <p>don Juan.</p>
 <p>I had all along respected our agreement that we would talk about dreaming only when he </p>
 <p>brought up the subject. How ever, I thought that this was an emergency.</p>
 <p>"Does it sound to you like it's not you but someone else?" he asked.</p>
 <p>"Come to think of it, yes. I don't sound like myself at those times."</p>
 <p>"Then it's not you. It's not time yet to explain it. But let's say that we are not alone in this </p>
 <p>world. Let's say that there are other worlds available to dreamers, total worlds. From </p>
 <p>those other total worlds, energetic entities sometimes come to us. The next time you hear </p>
 <p>yourself nagging at yourself in your dreams, get really angry and yell a command. Say, </p>
 <p>Stop it!"</p>
 <p>I entered into another challenging arena: to remember in my dreams to shout that </p>
 <p>command. I believe that, perhaps, out of being so tremendously annoyed at hearing </p>
 <p>myself nagging, I</p>
 <p>did remember to shout, Stop it. The nagging ceased instantly and never again was </p>
 <p>repeated.</p>
 <p>"Does every dreamer experience this?" I asked don Juan when I saw him again.</p>
 <p>"Some do," he answered, uninterestedly.</p>
 <p>I began to rant about how strange it had all been. He cut me off, saying, "You are ready </p>
 <p>now to get to the second gate of dreaming."</p>
 <p>I seized the opportunity to seek answers for questions I had not been able to ask him. </p>
 <p>What I had experienced the first time he made me dream had been foremost in my mind. </p>
 <p>I told don Juan that I had observed the elements of my own dreams to my heart's content, </p>
 <p>and never had I felt anything even vaguely similar in terms of clarity and detail.</p>
 <p>"The more I think about it," I said, "the more intriguing it becomes. Watching those </p>
 <p>people in that dream, I experienced a fear and revulsion impossible to forget. What was </p>
 <p>that feeling, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"In my opinion, your energy body hooked onto the foreign energy of that place and had </p>
 <p>the time of its life. Naturally, you felt afraid and revolted; you were examining alien </p>
 <p>energy for the first time in your life.</p>
 <p>"You have a proclivity for behaving like the sorcerers of antiquity. The moment you have </p>
 <p>the chance, you let your assemblage point go. That time your assemblage point shifted </p>
 <p>quite a distance. The result was that you, like the old sorcerers, journeyed beyond the </p>
 <p>world we know. A most real but dangerous journey."</p>
 <p>I bypassed the meaning of his statements in favor of my own interest and asked him, </p>
 <p>"Was that city perhaps on another planet?"</p>
 <p>"You can't explain dreaming by way of things you know or suspect you know," he said. </p>
 <p>"All I can tell you is that the city you visited was not in this world."</p>
 <p>"Where was it, then?"</p>
 <p>"Out of this world, of course. You're not that stupid. That was the first thing you noticed. </p>
 <p>What got you going in circles is that you can't imagine anything being out of this world."</p>
 <p>"Where is out of this world, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Believe me, the most extravagant feature of sorcery is that configuration called out of </p>
 <p>this world. For instance, you assumed that I was seeing the same things you did. The </p>
 <p>proof is that you never asked me what I saw. You and only you saw a city and people in </p>
 <p>that city. I didn't see anything of the sort. I saw energy. So, out of this world was, for you </p>
 <p>alone, on that occasion, a city."</p>
 <p>"But then, don Juan, it wasn't a real city It existed only for me, in my mind."</p>
 <p>"No. That's not the case. Now you want to reduce something transcendental to something </p>
 <p>mundane. You can't do that. That journey was real. You saw it as a city. I saw it as </p>
 <p>energy. Neither of us is right or wrong."</p>
 <p>"My confusion comes when you talk about things being real. You said before that we </p>
 <p>reached a real place. But if it was real, how can we have two versions of it?"</p>
 <p>"Very simple. We have two versions because we had, at that time, two different rates of </p>
 <p>uniformity and cohesion. I have explained to you that those two attributes are the key to </p>
 <p>perceiving."</p>
 <p>"Do you think that I can go back to that particular city?"</p>
 <p>"You got me there. I don't know. Or perhaps I do know but can't explain it. Or perhaps I </p>
 <p>can explain it but I don't want to. You'll have to wait and figure out for yourself which is </p>
 <p>the case."</p>
 <p>He refused any further discussion.</p>
 <p>"Let's get on with our business," he said. "You reach the second gate of dreaming when </p>
 <p>you wake up from a dream into another dream. You can have as many dreams as you </p>
 <p>want or as many as you are capable of, but you must exercise adequate control and not </p>
 <p>wake up in the world we know."</p>
 <p>I had a jolt of panic. "Are you saying that I should never wake up in this world?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"No, I didn't mean that. But now that you have pointed it out, I have to tell you that it is </p>
 <p>an alternative. The sorcerers of antiquity used to do that, never wake up in the world we </p>
 <p>know. Some of the sorcerers of my line have done it too. It certainly can be done, but I </p>
 <p>don't recommend it. What I want is for you to wake up naturally when you are through </p>
 <p>with dreaming, but while you are dreaming, I want you to dream that you wake up in </p>
 <p>another dream."</p>
 <p>I heard myself asking the same question I had asked the first time he told me about </p>
 <p>setting up dreaming. "But is it possible to do that?"</p>
 <p>Don Juan obviously caught on to my mindlessness and laughingly repeated the answer he </p>
 <p>had given me before. "Of course it's possible. This control is no different from the </p>
 <p>control we have over any situation in our daily lives."</p>
 <p>I quickly got over my embarrassment and was ready to ask more questions, but don Juan </p>
 <p>anticipated me and began to explain facets of the second gate of dreaming, an explanation </p>
 <p>that made me yet more uneasy.</p>
 <p>"There's one problem with the second gate," he said. "It's a problem that can be serious, </p>
 <p>depending on one's bent of character. If our tendency is to indulge in clinging to things or </p>
 <p>situations, we are in for a sock in the jaw."</p>
 <p>"In what way, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Think for a moment. You've already experienced the outlandish joy of examining your </p>
 <p>dreams' contents. Imagine your- sell going from dream to dream, watching everything, </p>
 <p>examining every detail. It's very easy to realize that one may sink to mortal depths. </p>
 <p>Especially if one is given to indulging."</p>
 <p>"Wouldn't the body or the brain naturally put a stop to it?"</p>
 <p>"If it's a natural sleeping situation, meaning normal, yes. But this is not a normal </p>
 <p>situation. This is dreaming. A dreamer on crossing the first gate has already reached the </p>
 <p>energy body. So what is really going through the second gate, hopping from dream to </p>
 <p>dream, is the energy body."</p>
 <p>"What's the implication of all this, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"The implication is that on crossing the second gate you must intend a greater and more </p>
 <p>sober control over your dreaming attention: the only safety valve for dreamers."</p>
 <p>"What is this safety valve?"</p>
 <p>"You will find out for yourself that the true goal of dreaming is to perfect the energy </p>
 <p>body. A perfect energy body, among other things of course, has such a control over the </p>
 <p>dreaming attention that it makes it stop when needed. This is the safety valve dreamers </p>
 <p>have. No matter how indulging they might be, at a given time, their dreaming attention </p>
 <p>must make them surface."</p>
 <p>I started all over again on another dreaming quest. This time the goal was more elusive </p>
 <p>and the difficulty even greater. Exactly as with my first task, I could not begin to figure </p>
 <p>out what to do. I had the discouraging suspicion that all my practice was not going to be </p>
 <p>of much help this time. After countless failures, I gave up and settled down to simply </p>
 <p>continue my practice of fixing my dreaming attention on every item of my dreams. </p>
 <p>Accepting my shortcomings seemed to give me a boost, and I became even more adept at </p>
 <p>sustaining the view of any item in my dreams.</p>
 <p>A year went by without any change. Then one day some thing changed. As I was </p>
 <p>watching a window in a dream, trying to. find out if I could catch a glimpse of the </p>
 <p>scenery outside the room, some windlike force, which I felt as a buzzing in my ears, </p>
 <p>pulled me through the window to the outside. Just before that pull, my dreaming attention </p>
 <p>had been caught by a strange structure some distance away. It looked like a tractor. The </p>
 <p>next thing I knew, I was standing by it, examining it.</p>
 <p>I was perfectly aware that I was dreaming. I looked around to find out if I could tell from </p>
 <p>what window I had been looking. The scene was that of a farm in the countryside. No </p>
 <p>buildings</p>
 <p>were in sight. I wanted to ponder this. However, the quantity of farm machinery lying </p>
 <p>around, as if abandoned, took all my attention. I examined mowing machines, tractors, </p>
 <p>grain harvesters, disk plows, thrashers. There were so many that I forgot my original </p>
 <p>dream. What I wanted then was to orient myself by watching the immediate scenery. </p>
 <p>There was something in the distance that looked like a billboard and some telephone </p>
 <p>poles around it.</p>
 <p>The instant I focused my attention on that billboard, I was next to it. The steel structure of </p>
 <p>the billboard gave me a fright. It was menacing. On the billboard itself was a picture of a </p>
 <p>building. I read the text; it was an advertisement for a motel. I had a peculiar certainty </p>
 <p>that I was in Oregon or northern California.</p>
 <p>I looked for other features in the environment of my dream. I saw mountains very far </p>
 <p>away and some green, round hills not too far. On those hills were clumps of what I </p>
 <p>thought were California oak trees. I wanted to be pulled by the green hills, but what </p>
 <p>pulled me were the distant mountains. I was convinced that they were the Sierras.</p>
 <p>All my dreaming energy left me on those mountains. But before it did, I was pulled by </p>
 <p>every possible feature. My dream ceased to be a dream. As far as my capacity to perceive </p>
 <p>was concerned, I was veritably in the Sierras, zooming into ravines, boulders, trees, </p>
 <p>caves. I went from scarp faces to mountain peaks until I had no more drive and could not </p>
 <p>focus my dreaming attention on anything. I felt myself losing control. Finally, there was </p>
 <p>no more scenery, just darkness.</p>
 <p>"You have reached the second gate of dreaming," don Juan said when I narrated my </p>
 <p>dream to him. "What you should do next is to cross it. Crossing the second gate is a very </p>
 <p>serious affair; it requires a most disciplined effort."</p>
 <p>I was not sure I had fulfilled the task he outlined for me, because I had not really woken </p>
 <p>up in another dream. I asked don Juan about this irregularity.</p>
 <p>"The mistake was mine," he said. "I told you that one has to wake up in another dream, </p>
 <p>but what I meant is that one has to change dreams in an orderly and precise manner, the </p>
 <p>way you have done it.</p>
 <p>"With the first gate, you wasted a lot of time looking exclusively for your hands. This </p>
 <p>time, you went directly to the solution without bothering to follow the given command: to </p>
 <p>wake up in another dream."</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that there are two ways of properly crossing the second gate of dreaming. </p>
 <p>One is to wake up in another dream, that is to say, to dream that one is having a dream </p>
 <p>and then dream that one wakes up from it. The alternative is to use the items of a dream </p>
 <p>to trigger another dream, exactly as I had done.</p>
 <p>Just as he had been doing all along, don Juan let me practice without any interference on </p>
 <p>his part. And I corroborated the two alternatives he described. Either I dreamt that I was </p>
 <p>having a dream from which I dreamt I woke up or I zoomed from a definite item </p>
 <p>accessible to my immediate dreaming attention to another one, not quite accessible. Or I </p>
 <p>entered into a slight variation of the second: I gazed at any item of a dream, maintaining </p>
 <p>the gaze until the item changed shape and, by changing shape, pulled me into another </p>
 <p>dream through a buzzing vortex. Never was I capable, however, of deciding beforehand </p>
 <p>which of the three I would follow. My dreaming practices always ended by my running </p>
 <p>out of dreaming attention and finally waking up or by my falling into dark, deep slumber.</p>
 <p>Everything went smoothly in my practices. The only disturbance I had was a peculiar </p>
 <p>interference, a jolt of fear or discomfort I had begun to experience with increasing </p>
 <p>frequency. My way of discarding it was to believe that it was related to my ghastly eating </p>
 <p>habits or to the fact that, in those days, don Juan was giving me a profusion of </p>
 <p>hallucinogenic plants as part of my training. Those jolts became so prominent, however, </p>
 <p>that I had to ask don Juan's advice.</p>
 <p>"You have entered now into the most dangerous facet of the sorcerers' knowledge," he </p>
 <p>began. "it is sheer dread, a veritable nightmare. I could joke with you and say that I didn't </p>
 <p>mention this possibility to you out of regard for your cherished rationality, but I can't. </p>
 <p>Every sorcerer has to face it. Here is where, I fear, you might very well think you're </p>
 <p>going off the deep end."</p>
 <p>Don Juan very solemnly explained that life and consciousness, being exclusively a matter </p>
 <p>of energy, are not solely the property of organisms. He said that sorcerers have seen that </p>
 <p>there are two types of conscious beings roaming the earth, the organic and the inorganic, </p>
 <p>and that in comparing one with the other, they have seen that both are luminous masses </p>
 <p>crossed from every imaginable angle by millions of the universe's energy filaments. They </p>
 <p>are different from each other in their shape and in their degree of brightness. Inorganic </p>
 <p>beings are long and candlelike but opaque, whereas organic beings are round and by far </p>
 <p>the brighter. Another noteworthy difference, which don Juan said sorcerers have seen, is </p>
 <p>that the life and consciousness of organic beings is short-lived, because they are made to </p>
 <p>hurry, whereas the life of inorganic beings is infinitely longer and their consciousness </p>
 <p>infinitely more calm and deeper.</p>
 <p>"Sorcerers find no problem interacting with them," don Juan went on. "Inorganic beings </p>
 <p>possess the crucial ingredient for interaction, consciousness."</p>
 <p>"But do these inorganic beings really exist? Like you and I exist?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Of course they do," he replied. "Believe me, sorcerers are very intelligent creatures; </p>
 <p>under no condition would they toy with aberrations of the mind and then take them for </p>
 <p>real."</p>
 <p>"Why do you say they are alive?"</p>
 <p>"For sorcerers, having life means having consciousness. It means having an assemblage </p>
 <p>point and its surrounding glow of awareness, a condition that points out to sorcerers that </p>
 <p>the being in front of them, organic or inorganic, is thoroughly capable of perceiving. </p>
 <p>Perceiving is understood by sorcerers as the precondition of being alive."</p>
 <p>"Then the inorganic beings must also die. Is that true, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Naturally. They lose their awareness just like we do, except that the length of their </p>
 <p>consciousness is staggering to the mind."</p>
 <p>"Do these inorganic beings appear to sorcerers?"</p>
 <p>"It's very difficult to tell what is what with them. Let's say that those beings are enticed </p>
 <p>by us or, better yet, compelled to interact with us."</p>
 <p>Don Juan peered at me most intently. "You're not taking in any of this at all," he said </p>
 <p>with the tone of someone who has reached a conclusion.</p>
 <p>"It's nearly impossible for me to think about this rationally," I said.</p>
 <p>"I warned you that the subject will tax your reason. The proper thing to do then is to </p>
 <p>suspend judgment and let things take their course, meaning that you let the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings come to you."</p>
 <p>"Are you serious, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Deadly serious. The difficulty with inorganic beings is that their awareness is very slow </p>
 <p>in comparison with ours. It will take years for a sorcerer to be acknowledged by inorganic </p>
 <p>beings. So, it is advisable to have patience and wait. Sooner or later they show up. But </p>
 <p>not like you or I would show up. Theirs is a most peculiar way to make themselves </p>
 <p>known."</p>
 <p>"How do sorcerers entice them? Do they have a ritual?"</p>
 <p>"Well, they certainly don't stand in the middle of the road and call out to them with </p>
 <p>trembling voices at the stroke of midnight, if that's what you mean."</p>
 <p>"What do they do then?"</p>
 <p>"They entice them in dreaming. I said that what's involved is more than enticing them; by </p>
 <p>the act of dreaming, sorcerers compel those beings to interact with them."</p>
 <p>"How do sorcerers compel them by the act of dreaming?"</p>
 <p>"Dreaming is sustaining the position where the assemblage point has shifted in dreams. </p>
 <p>This act creates a distinctive energy charge, which attracts their attention. It's like bait to </p>
 <p>fish; they'll go for it. Sorcerers, by reaching and crossing the first two gates' of dreaming, </p>
 <p>set bait for those beings and compel them to appear.</p>
 <p>"By going through the two gates, you have made your bidding known to them. Now, you </p>
 <p>must wait for a sign from them."</p>
 <p>"What would the sign be, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Possibly the appearance of one of them, although that seems too soon. I am of the </p>
 <p>opinion that their sign will be simply some interference in your dreaming. I believe that </p>
 <p>the jolts of fear you are experiencing nowadays are not indigestion but energy jolts sent </p>
 <p>to you by the inorganic beings."</p>
 <p>"What should I do?"</p>
 <p>"You must gauge your expectations."</p>
 <p>I could not understand what he meant, and he carefully explained that our normal </p>
 <p>expectation when engaging in inter action with our fellow men or with other organic </p>
 <p>beings is to get an immediate reply to our solicitation. With inorganic beings, however, </p>
 <p>since they are separated from us by a most formidable barrier-energy that moves at a </p>
 <p>different speed- sorcerers must gauge their expectations and sustain the solicitation for </p>
 <p>as long as it takes to be acknowledged.</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that the solicitation is the same as the dreaming practices?"</p>
 <p>"Yes. But for a perfect result, you must add to your practices the intent of reaching those </p>
 <p>inorganic beings. Send a feeling of power and confidence to them, a feeling of strength, </p>
 <p>of detachment. Avoid at any cost sending a feeling of fear or morbidity They are pretty </p>
 <p>morbid by themselves; to add your morbidity to them is unnecessary, to say the least."</p>
 <p>"I'm not clear, don Juan, about the way they appear to sorcerers. What is the peculiar </p>
 <p>way they make themselves known?"</p>
 <p>"They do, at times, materialize themselves in the daily world, right in front of us. Most of </p>
 <p>the time, though, their invisible presence is marked by a bodily jolt, a shiver of sorts that </p>
 <p>comes from the marrow of the bones."</p>
 <p>"What about in dreaming, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"In dreaming we have the total opposite. At times, we feel them the way you are feeling </p>
 <p>them, as a jolt of fear. Most of the time, they materialize themselves right in front of us. </p>
 <p>Since at the beginning of dreaming we have no experience whatsoever with them, they </p>
 <p>might imbue us with fear beyond measure. That is a real danger to us. Through the </p>
 <p>channel of fear, they can follow us to the daily world, with disastrous results for us."</p>
 <p>"In what way, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Fear can settle down in our lives, and we would have to be mavericks to deal with it. </p>
 <p>Inorganic beings can be worse than a pest. Through fear they can easily drive us raving </p>
 <p>mad."</p>
 <p>"What do sorcerers do with inorganic beings?"</p>
 <p>"They mingle with them. They turn them into allies. They form associations, create </p>
 <p>extraordinary friendships. I call them vast enterprises, where perception plays the </p>
 <p>uppermost role. We are social beings. We unavoidably seek the company of </p>
 <p>consciousness.</p>
 <p>"With inorganic beings, the secret is not to fear them. And this must be done from the </p>
 <p>beginning. The intent one has to send out to them has to be of power and abandon. In that </p>
 <p>intent one must encode the message 'I don't fear you. Come to see me. If you do, I'll </p>
 <p>welcome you. If you don't want to come, I'll miss you.' With a message like this, they'll </p>
 <p>get so curious that they'll come for sure."</p>
 <p>"Why should they come to seek me, or why on earth should I seek them?"</p>
 <p>"Dreamers, whether they like it or not, in their dreaming seek associations with other </p>
 <p>beings. This may come to you as a shock, but dreamers automatically seek groups of </p>
 <p>beings, nexuses of inorganic beings in this case. Dreamers seek them avidly."</p>
 <p>"This is very strange to me, don Juan. Why would dreamers do that?"</p>
 <p>"The novelty for us is the inorganic beings. And the novelty for them is one of our kind </p>
 <p>crossing the boundaries of their realm. The thing you must bear in mind from now on is </p>
 <p>that inorganic beings with their superb consciousness exert a tremendous pull over </p>
 <p>dreamers and can easily transport them into worlds beyond description.</p>
 <p>"The sorcerers of antiquity used them, and they are the ones who coined the name allies. </p>
 <p>Their allies taught them to move the assemblage point out of the egg's boundaries into </p>
 <p>the non human universe. So when they transport a sorcerer, they transport him to worlds </p>
 <p>beyond the human domain."</p>
 <p>As I heard him talk, I was plagued by strange fears and misgivings, which he promptly </p>
 <p>realized.</p>
 <p>"You are a religious man to the end." He laughed. "Now, you're feeling the devil </p>
 <p>breathing down your neck. Think about dreaming in these terms: dreaming is perceiving </p>
 <p>more than what we believe it is possible to perceive."</p>
 <p>In my waking hours, I worried about the possibility that inorganic conscious beings really </p>
 <p>existed. When I was dreaming, however, my conscious worries did not have much effect. </p>
 <p>The jolts of physical fear continued, but whenever they happened a strange calmness </p>
 <p>always trailed behind, a calmness that took control of me and let me proceed as if I had </p>
 <p>no fear at all.</p>
 <p>It seemed at that time that every breakthrough in dreaming happened to me suddenly, </p>
 <p>without warning. The presence of inorganic beings in my dreams was no exception. It </p>
 <p>happened while I was dreaming about a circus I knew in my childhood. The setting </p>
 <p>looked like a town in the mountains in Arizona. I began to watch people with the vague </p>
 <p>hope I always had that I would see again the people I had seen the first time don Juan </p>
 <p>made me enter into the second attention.</p>
 <p>As I watched them, I felt a sizable jolt of nervousness in the pit of my stomach; it was </p>
 <p>like a punch. The jolt distracted me, and I lost sight of the people, the circus, and the </p>
 <p>mountain town in Arizona. In their place stood two strange-looking figures. They were </p>
 <p>thin, less than a foot wide, but long, perhaps seven feet. They were looming over me like </p>
 <p>two gigantic earth worms.</p>
 <p>I knew that it was a dream, but I also knew that I was seeing. Don Juan had discussed </p>
 <p>seeing in my normal awareness and in the second attention as well. Although I was </p>
 <p>incapable of experiencing it myself, I thought I had understood the idea of directly </p>
 <p>perceiving energy. In that dream, looking at those two strange apparitions, I realized that </p>
 <p>I was seeing the energy essence of something unbelievable.</p>
 <p>I remained very calm. I did not move. The most remarkable thing to me was that they </p>
 <p>didn't dissolve or change into some thing else. They were cohesive beings that retained </p>
 <p>their candlelike shape. Something in them was forcing something in me to hold the view </p>
 <p>of their shape. I knew it because something was telling me that if I did not move, they </p>
 <p>would not move either.</p>
 <p>It all came to an end, at a given moment, when I woke up with a fright. I was </p>
 <p>immediately besieged by fears. A deep preoccupation took hold of me. It was not </p>
 <p>psychological worry but rather a bodily sense of anguish, sadness with no apparent </p>
 <p>foundation.</p>
 <p>The two strange shapes appeared to me from then on in every one of my dreaming </p>
 <p>sessions. Eventually, it was as if I dreamt only to encounter them. They never attempted </p>
 <p>to move toward me or to interfere with me in any way. They just stood there, immobile, </p>
 <p>in front of me, for as long as my dream lasted. Not only did I never make any effort to </p>
 <p>change my dreams but I even forgot the original quest of my dreaming practices.</p>
 <p>When I finally discussed with don Juan what was happening to me, I had spent months </p>
 <p>solely viewing the two shapes.</p>
 <p>"You are stuck at a dangerous crossroad," don Juan said. "It isn't right to chase these </p>
 <p>beings away, but it isn't right either to let them stay. For the time being, their presence is </p>
 <p>a hindrance to your dreaming."</p>
 <p>"What can I do, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Face them, right now, in the world of daily life, and tell them to come back later, when </p>
 <p>you have more dreaming power."</p>
 <p>"How do I face them?"</p>
 <p>"It's not simple, but it can be done. It requires only that you have enough guts, which of </p>
 <p>course you do."</p>
 <p>Without waiting for me to tell him that I had no guts at all, he took me to the hills. He </p>
 <p>lived then in northern Mexico, and he had given me the total impression he was a solitary </p>
 <p>sorcerer, an old man forgotten by everybody and completely outside the main current of </p>
 <p>human affairs. I had surmised, however, that he was intelligent beyond measure. And </p>
 <p>because of this I was willing to comply with what I half-believed were mere </p>
 <p>eccentricities.</p>
 <p>The cunningness of sorcerers, cultivated through the ages, was don Juan's trademark. He </p>
 <p>made sure that I understood all I could in my normal awareness and, at the same time, he </p>
 <p>made sure that I entered into the second attention, where I under stood or at least </p>
 <p>passionately listened to everything he taught me. In this fashion, he divided me in two. In </p>
 <p>my normal consciousness, I could not understand why or how I was more than willing to </p>
 <p>take his eccentricities seriously. In the second attention, it all made sense to me.</p>
 <p>His contention was that the second attention is available to all of us, but, by willfully </p>
 <p>holding on to our half-cocked rationality, some of us more fiercely than others, keep the </p>
 <p>second attention at arm's length. His idea was that dreaming brings down the bathers that </p>
 <p>surround and insulate the second attention.</p>
 <p>The day he took me to the hills of the Sonoran desert to meet the inorganic beings, I was </p>
 <p>in my normal state of awareness. Yet somehow I knew I had to do something that was </p>
 <p>certainly going to be unbelievable.</p>
 <p>It had rained lightly in the desert. The red dirt was still wet, and as I walked it got </p>
 <p>clumped up in the rubber soles of my shoes. I had to step on rocks to remove the heavy </p>
 <p>chunks of dirt. We walked in an easterly direction, climbing toward the hills. When we </p>
 <p>got to a narrow gully between two hills, don Juan stopped.</p>
 <p>"This is for sure an ideal place to summon your friends," he said.</p>
 <p>"Why do you call them my friends?"</p>
 <p>"They have singled you out themselves. When they do that, it means that they seek an </p>
 <p>association. I've mentioned to you that sorcerers form bonds of friendship with them. </p>
 <p>Your case seems to be an example. And you don't even have to solicit them."</p>
 <p>"What does such a friendship consist of, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"It consists of a mutual exchange of energy. The inorganic beings supply their high </p>
 <p>awareness, and sorcerers supply their heightened awareness and high energy. The </p>
 <p>positive result is an even exchange. The negative one is dependency on both parties.</p>
 <p>"The old sorcerers used to love their allies. In fact, they loved their allies more than they </p>
 <p>loved their own kind. I can foresee terrible dangers in that."</p>
 <p>"What do you recommend I do, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Summon them. Size them up, and then decide yourself what to do."</p>
 <p>"What should I do to summon them?"</p>
 <p>"Hold your dream view of them, in your mind. The reason they have saturated you with </p>
 <p>their presence in your dreams is that they want to create a memory of their shape in your </p>
 <p>mind. And this is the time to use that memory"</p>
 <p>Don Juan forcefully ordered me to close my eyes and keep them closed. Then he guided </p>
 <p>me to sit down on some rocks. I felt the hardness and the coldness of the rocks. The rocks </p>
 <p>were slanted; it was difficult to keep my balance.</p>
 <p>"Sit here and visualize their shape until they are just like they. are in your dreams," don </p>
 <p>Juan said in my ear. "Let me know when you have them in focus."</p>
 <p>It took me very little time and effort to have a complete mental picture of their shape, just </p>
 <p>like in my dreams. It did not surprise me at all that I could do it. What shocked me was </p>
 <p>that, although I tried desperately to let don Juan know I had pictured them in my mind, I </p>
 <p>could not voice my words or open my eyes. I was definitely awake. I could hear every </p>
 <p>thing.</p>
 <p>I heard don Juan say, "You can open your 'eyes now." I opened them with no difficulty I </p>
 <p>was sitting cross-legged on some rocks, which were not the same ones I had felt under </p>
 <p>me when I sat down. Don Juan was just behind me to my right. I tried to turn around to </p>
 <p>face him, but he forced my head to remain straight. And then I saw two dark figures, like </p>
 <p>two thin tree trunks, right in front of me.</p>
 <p>I stared at them openmouthed; they were not as tall as in my dreams. They had shrunk to </p>
 <p>half their size. Instead of being shapes of opaque luminosity, they were now two </p>
 <p>condensed, dark, almost black, menacing sticks.</p>
 <p>"Get up and grab one of them," don Juan ordered me, "and don't let go, no matter how it </p>
 <p>shakes you."</p>
 <p>I definitely did not want to do anything of the sort, but some unknown drive made me </p>
 <p>stand up against my will. I had at that moment the clear realization that I would end up </p>
 <p>doing what he had ordered me to, although I had no conscious intention of doing so.</p>
 <p>Mechanically, I advanced toward the two figures, my heart pounding nearly out of my </p>
 <p>chest. I grabbed the one to my right. What I felt was an electric discharge that almost </p>
 <p>made me drop the dark figure.</p>
 <p>Don Juan's voice came to me as if he had been yelling from a distance away. "You drop </p>
 <p>it and you're done for," he said.</p>
 <p>I held on to the figure, which twirled and shook. Not like a massive animal would, but </p>
 <p>like something quite fluffy and light, although strongly electrical. We rolled and turned </p>
 <p>on the sand of the gully for quite some time. It gave me jolt after jolt of some sickening </p>
 <p>electric current. I thought it was sickening because I fancied it to be different from the </p>
 <p>energy I had always encountered in our daily world. When it hit my body, it tickled me </p>
 <p>and made me yell and growl like an animal, not in anguish but in a strange anger.</p>
 <p>It finally became a still, almost solid form under me. It lay inert. I asked don Juan if it </p>
 <p>was dead, but I did not hear my voice.</p>
 <p>"Not a chance," said someone laughing, someone who was not don Juan. "You've just </p>
 <p>depleted its energy charge. But don't get up yet. Lie there just a moment longer."</p>
 <p>I looked at don Juan with a question in my eyes. He was examining me with great </p>
 <p>curiosity. Then he helped me up. The dark figure remained on the ground. I wanted to ask </p>
 <p>don Juan if the dark figure was all right. Again, I could not voice my question. Then I did </p>
 <p>something extravagant. I took it all for real. Up to that moment something in my mind </p>
 <p>was preserving my rationality by taking what was happening as a dream, a dream induced </p>
 <p>by don Juan's machinations.</p>
 <p>I went to the figure on the ground and tried to lift it up. I could not put my arms around it </p>
 <p>because it had no mass. I became disoriented. The same voice, which was not don Juan's, </p>
 <p>told me to lie down on top of the inorganic being. I did it, and both of us got up in one </p>
 <p>motion, the inorganic being like a dark shadow attached to me. It gently separated from </p>
 <p>me and disappeared, leaving me with an extremely pleasant feeling of completeness.</p>
 <p>It took me more than twenty-four hours to regain total control of my faculties. I slept </p>
 <p>most of the time. Don Juan checked me from time to time by asking me the same </p>
 <p>question, "Was the inorganic being's energy like fire or like water?"</p>
 <p>My throat seemed scorched. I could not tell him that the energy jolts I had felt were like </p>
 <p>jets of electrified water. I have never felt jets of electrified water in my life. I am not sure </p>
 <p>if it is possible to produce them or to feel them, but that was the image playing in my </p>
 <p>mind every time don Juan asked his key question.</p>
 <p>Don Juan was asleep when I finally knew I was completely recovered. Knowing that his </p>
 <p>question was of great importance, I woke him up and told him what I had felt.</p>
 <p>"You are not going to have helping friends among the inorganic beings, but relationships </p>
 <p>of annoying dependence," he stated. "Be extremely careful. Watery inorganic beings are </p>
 <p>more given to excesses. The old sorcerers believed that they were more loving, more </p>
 <p>capable of imitating, or perhaps even having feelings. As opposed to the fiery ones, who </p>
 <p>were thought to be more serious, more contained than the others, but also more </p>
 <p>pompous."</p>
 <p>"What's the meaning of all this for me, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"The meaning is too vast to discuss at this time. My recommendation is that you vanquish </p>
 <p>fear from your dreams and from your life, in order to safeguard your unity The inorganic </p>
 <p>being you depleted of energy and then recharged again was thrilled out of its candlelike </p>
 <p>shape with it. It'll come to you for more."</p>
 <p>"Why didn't you stop me, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"You didn't give me time. Besides, you didn't even hear me shouting at you to leave the </p>
 <p>inorganic being on the ground."</p>
 <p>"You should have lectured me, beforehand, the way you always do, about all the </p>
 <p>possibilities."</p>
 <p>"I didn't know all the possibilities. In matters of the inorganic beings, I am nearly a </p>
 <p>novice. I refused that part of the sorcerers' knowledge on the ground that it is too </p>
 <p>cumbersome and capricious. I don't want to be at the mercy of any entity. organic or </p>
 <p>inorganic."</p>
 <p>That was the end of our exchange. I should have been worried because of his definitely </p>
 <p>negative reaction, but I was not. I somehow was certain that whatever I had done was all </p>
 <p>right.</p>
 <p>I continued my dreaming practices without any interference from the inorganic beings.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 4</p>
 <p>THE FIXATION OF THE ASSEMBLAGE POINT</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Since our agreement had been to discuss dreaming only when don Juan considered it </p>
 <p>necessary, I rarely asked him about it and never insisted on continuing my questions </p>
 <p>beyond a certain point. I was more than eager, therefore, to listen to him whenever he </p>
 <p>decided to take up the subject. His comments or discussions on dreaming were invariably </p>
 <p>cushioned in other topics of his teachings, and they were always suddenly and abruptly </p>
 <p>brought in.</p>
 <p>We were engaged in some unrelated conversation once, while I was visiting with him in </p>
 <p>his house, when without any preamble he said that, by means of their dreaming contacts </p>
 <p>with inorganic beings, the old sorcerers became immensely well-versed in the </p>
 <p>manipulation of the assemblage point, a vast and ominous subject.</p>
 <p>I immediately grabbed the opportunity and asked don Juan for an estimate of the time </p>
 <p>when the old sorcerers might have lived. At various opportunities before, I had asked the </p>
 <p>same question, but he never gave me a satisfactory answer. I was confident, however, that </p>
 <p>at the moment, perhaps because he had brought up the subject himself, he might be </p>
 <p>willing to oblige me.</p>
 <p>"A most trying subject," he said. The way he said it made me believe he was discarding </p>
 <p>my question. I was quite surprised when he continued talking. "It'll tax your rationality as </p>
 <p>much as the topic of inorganic beings. By the way, what do you think about them now?"</p>
 <p>"I have let my opinions rest," I said. "I can't afford to think one way or another."</p>
 <p>My answer delighted him. He laughed and commented on his own fears of and aversions </p>
 <p>to the inorganic beings.</p>
 <p>"They have never been my cup of tea," he said. "Of course, the main reason was my fear </p>
 <p>of them. I was unable to get over it when I had to, and then it became fixed."</p>
 <p>"Do you fear them now, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"It's not quite fear I feel but revulsion. I don't want any part of them."</p>
 <p>"Is there any particular reason for this revulsion?"</p>
 <p>"The best reason in the world: we are antithetical. They love slavery, and I love freedom. </p>
 <p>They love to buy, and I don't sell."</p>
 <p>I became inexplicably agitated and brusquely told him that the subject was so farfetched </p>
 <p>for me that I could not take it seriously.</p>
 <p>He stared at me, smiling, and said, "The best thing to do with inorganic beings is what </p>
 <p>you do: deny their existence but visit with them regularly and maintain that you are </p>
 <p>dreaming and in dreaming anything is possible. This way you don't commit yourself."</p>
 <p>I felt strangely guilt although I could not figure out why. I felt compelled to ask, "What </p>
 <p>are you referring to, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"To your visits with the inorganic beings," he replied dryly.</p>
 <p>"Are you kidding? What visits?"</p>
 <p>"I didn't want to discuss this, but I think it's time I tell you that the nagging voice you </p>
 <p>heard, reminding you to fix your dreaming attention on the items of your dreams, was the </p>
 <p>voice of an inorganic being."</p>
 <p>I thought don Juan was completely irrational. I became so irritated that I even yelled at </p>
 <p>him. He laughed at me and asked me to tell him about my irregular dreaming sessions. </p>
 <p>That request surprised me. I had never mentioned to anyone that every so often I used to </p>
 <p>zoom out of a dream, pulled by a given item, but instead of my changing dreams, as I </p>
 <p>should have, the total mood of the dream changed and I would find myself in a dimension </p>
 <p>unknown to me. I soared in it, directed by some invisible guide, which made me twirl </p>
 <p>around and around. I always awoke from one of these dreams still twirling, and I </p>
 <p>continued tossing and turning for a long time before I fully woke up.</p>
 <p>"Those are bona fide meetings you are having with your inorganic being friends," don </p>
 <p>Juan said.</p>
 <p>I did not want to argue with him, but neither did I want to agree. I remained silent. I had </p>
 <p>forgotten my question about the old sorcerers, but don Juan picked up the subject again.</p>
 <p>"My understanding is that the old sorcerers existed perhaps as far back as ten thousand </p>
 <p>years ago," he said, smiling and watching my reaction.</p>
 <p>Basing my response on current archaeological data on the migration of Asiatic nomadic </p>
 <p>tribes to the Americas, I said that I believed his date was incorrect. Ten thousand years </p>
 <p>was too far back.</p>
 <p>"You have your knowledge and I have mine," he said. "My knowledge is that the old </p>
 <p>sorcerers ruled for four thousand years, from seven thousand to three thousand years ago. </p>
 <p>Three thousand years ago, they went to nothing. And from then on, sorcerers have been </p>
 <p>regrouping, restructuring what was left of the old ones."</p>
 <p>"How can you be so sure about your dates?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"How can you be so sure about yours?" he retorted.</p>
 <p>I told him that archaeologists have foolproof methods to establish the date of past </p>
 <p>cultures. Again he retorted that sorcerers have foolproof methods of their own.</p>
 <p>"I'm not trying to be contrary or argue you down," he continued, "but someday soon you </p>
 <p>may be able to ask someone who knows for sure."</p>
 <p>"No one can know this for sure, don Juan."</p>
 <p>"This is another of those impossible things to believe, but there is somebody who can </p>
 <p>verify all this. You'll meet that person someday."</p>
 <p>"Come on, don Juan, you've got to be joking. Who can verify what happened seven </p>
 <p>thousand years ago?"</p>
 <p>"Very simple, one of the old sorcerers we've been talking about. The one I met. He's the </p>
 <p>one who told me all about the old sorcerers. I hope you remember what I am going to tell </p>
 <p>you about that particular man. He is the key to many of our endeavors, and he's also the </p>
 <p>one you have to meet."</p>
 <p>I told don Juan that I was hanging on every word he said, even though I did not </p>
 <p>understand what he was saying. He accused me of humoring him and not believing a </p>
 <p>word about the old sorcerers. I admitted that in my state of daily consciousness, of </p>
 <p>course, I had not believed those farfetched stories. But neither had I in the second </p>
 <p>attention, although there I should have had a different reaction.</p>
 <p>"Only when you ponder what I said does it become a far fetched story," he remarked. "If </p>
 <p>you don't involve your common sense, it remains purely a matter of energy."</p>
 <p>"Why did you say, don Juan, that I am going to meet one of the old sorcerers?"</p>
 <p>"Because you are. It is vital that the two of you meet, some day. But, for the moment, just </p>
 <p>let me tell you another farfetched story about one of the naguals of my line, the nagual </p>
 <p>Sebastian."</p>
 <p>Don Juan told me then that the nagual Sebastian had been a sexton in a church in </p>
 <p>southern Mexico around the beginning of the eighteenth century. In his account, don Juan </p>
 <p>stressed how sorcerers, past or present, seek and find refuge in established institutions, </p>
 <p>such as the Church. It was his idea that because of their superior discipline, sorcerers are </p>
 <p>trustworthy employees and that they are avidly sought by institutions that are always in </p>
 <p>dire need of such persons. Don Juan maintained that as long as no one is aware of the </p>
 <p>sorcerers' doings, their lack of ideological sympathies makes them appear as model </p>
 <p>workers.</p>
 <p>Don Juan continued his story and said that one day, while Sebastian was performing his </p>
 <p>duties as a sexton, a strange man came to the church, an old Indian who seemed to be ill. </p>
 <p>In a weak voice he told Sebastian that he needed help. The nagual thought that the Indian </p>
 <p>wanted the parish priest, but the man, making a great effort, addressed the nagual. In a </p>
 <p>harsh and direct tone, he told him that he knew that Sebastian was not only a sorcerer but </p>
 <p>a nagual.</p>
 <p>Sebastian, quite alarmed by this sudden turn of events, pulled the Indian aside and </p>
 <p>demanded an apology. The man replied that he was not there to apologize but to get </p>
 <p>specialized help. He needed, he said, to receive the nagual's energy in order to maintain </p>
 <p>his life, which, he assured Sebastian, had spanned thousands of years but at the moment </p>
 <p>was ebbing away.</p>
 <p>Sebastian, who was a very intelligent man, unwilling to pay attention to such nonsense, </p>
 <p>urged the Indian to stop clowning around. The old man became angry and threatened </p>
 <p>Sebastian with exposing him and his group to the ecclesiastical authorities if he did not </p>
 <p>comply with his request.</p>
 <p>Don Juan reminded me that those were the times when the ecclesiastical authorities were </p>
 <p>brutally and systematically eradicating heretical practices among the Indians of the New </p>
 <p>World. The man's threat was not something to be taken lightly; the nagual and his group </p>
 <p>were indeed in mortal danger. Sebastian. asked the Indian how he could give him energy </p>
 <p>The man explained that naguals, by means of their discipline, gain a peculiar energy that </p>
 <p>they store in their bodies and that he would get it painlessly from Sebastian's energy </p>
 <p>center on his navel. In return for it, Sebastian would get not only the opportunity to </p>
 <p>continue his activities unscathed but also a gift of power.</p>
 <p>The knowledge that he was being manipulated by the old Indian did not sit right with the </p>
 <p>nagual, but the man was inflexible and left him no alternative but to comply with his </p>
 <p>request.</p>
 <p>Don Juan assured me that the old Indian was not exaggerating about his claims at all. He </p>
 <p>turned out to be one of the sorcerers of ancient times, one of those known as the death </p>
 <p>defiers. He had apparently survived to the present by manipulating his assemblage point </p>
 <p>in ways that only he knew about.</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that what transpired between Sebastian and that man later became the </p>
 <p>ground for an agreement that had bound all six naguals who followed Sebastian. The </p>
 <p>death defier kept his word; in exchange for energy from every one of those men, he made </p>
 <p>a donation to the giver, a gift of power. Sebastian had to accept such a gift, although </p>
 <p>reluctantly; he had been cornered and had no other choice. All the other naguals who </p>
 <p>followed him, however, gladly and proudly accepted their gifts.</p>
 <p>Don Juan concluded his story, saying that over time the death defier came to be known as </p>
 <p>the tenant. And for over two hundred years, the naguals of don Juan's line honored that </p>
 <p>binding agreement, creating a symbiotic relationship that changed the course and final </p>
 <p>goal of their lineage.</p>
 <p>Don Juan did not care to explain the story any further, and I was left with a strange </p>
 <p>sensation of truthfulness, which was more bothersome to me than I could have imagined.</p>
 <p>"How did he get to live that long?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"No one knows," don Juan replied. "All we've known about him, for generations, is what </p>
 <p>he tells us. The death defier is the one I asked about the old sorcerers, and he told me that </p>
 <p>they were at their peak three thousand years ago."</p>
 <p>"How do you know he was telling you the truth?" I asked.</p>
 <p>Don Juan shook his head in amazement, if not revulsion. "When you're facing that </p>
 <p>inconceivable unknown out there," he said, pointing all around him, "you don't fool </p>
 <p>around with petty lies. Petty lies are only for people who have never witnessed what's out </p>
 <p>there, waiting for them."</p>
 <p>"What's waiting for us out there, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>His answer, a seemingly innocuous phrase, was more terrifying to me than if he had </p>
 <p>described the most horrendous thing.</p>
 <p>"Something utterly impersonal," he said.</p>
 <p>He must have noticed that I was coming apart. He made me change levels of awareness </p>
 <p>to make my fright vanish.</p>
 <p>A few months later, my dreaming practices took a strange turn. I began to get, in my </p>
 <p>dreams, replies to questions I was planning to ask don Juan. The most impressive part of </p>
 <p>this oddity was that it quickly lapsed into my waking hours. And one day, while I was </p>
 <p>sitting at my desk, I got a reply to an unvoiced question about the realness of inorganic </p>
 <p>beings. I had seen inorganic beings in dreams so many times I had begun to think of them </p>
 <p>as real. I reminded myself I had even touched one, in a state of seminormal consciousness </p>
 <p>in the Sonoran desert. And my dreams had been periodically deviated to views of worlds </p>
 <p>I seriously doubted could have been products of my mentality. I wished to give don Juan </p>
 <p>my best shot, in terms of a concise query so I molded a question in my mind: if one is to </p>
 <p>accept that inorganic beings are as real as people, where, in the physicality of the </p>
 <p>universe, is the realm in which they exist?</p>
 <p>After formulating the question to myself, I heard a strange laughter, just as I had the day I </p>
 <p>wrestled with the inorganic being. Then a man's voice answered me. "That realm exists </p>
 <p>in a particular position of the assemblage point," it said. "Just like your world exists in </p>
 <p>the habitual position of the assemblage point."</p>
 <p>The last thing I wanted was to enter into a dialogue with a disembodied voice, so I stood </p>
 <p>up and ran out of my house. The thought occurred to me that I was losing my mind. </p>
 <p>Another worry to add to my collection of worries.</p>
 <p>The voice had been so clear and authoritative that it not only intrigued me but terrified </p>
 <p>me. I waited with great trepidation for oncoming barrages of that voice, but the event was </p>
 <p>never repeated. At the first opportunity I had, I consulted with don Juan.</p>
 <p>He was not impressed in the least. "You must understand, once and for all, that things </p>
 <p>like this are very normal in the life of a sorcerer," he said. "You are not going mad; you </p>
 <p>are simply hearing the voice of the dreaming emissary. Upon crossing the first or second </p>
 <p>gate of dreaming, dreamers reach a threshold of energy and begin to see things or to hear </p>
 <p>voices. Not really plural voices, but a singular voice. Sorcerers call it the voice of the </p>
 <p>dreaming emissary."</p>
 <p>"What is the dreaming emissary?"</p>
 <p>"Alien energy that has conciousness. Alien energy that purports to aid dreamers by telling </p>
 <p>them things. The problem with the dreaming emissary is that it can tell only what the </p>
 <p>sorcerers already know or should know, were they worth their salt."</p>
 <p>"To say that it's alien energy that has conciseness doesn't help me at all, don Juan. What </p>
 <p>kind of energy-benign, malignant, right, wrong, what?"</p>
 <p>"It's just what I said, alien energy An impersonal force that we turn into a very personal </p>
 <p>one because it has a voice. Some sorcerers swear by it. They even see it. Or, as you </p>
 <p>yourself have done, they simply hear it as a man's or a woman's voice. And the voice can </p>
 <p>tell them about the state of things, which most of the time they take as sacred advice."</p>
 <p>"Why do some of us hear it as a voice?"</p>
 <p>"We see it or hear it. because we maintain our assemblage points fixed on a specific new </p>
 <p>position; the more intense this fixation, the more intense our experience of the emissary </p>
 <p>Watch out! You may see it and feel it as a naked woman."</p>
 <p>Don Juan laughed at his own remark, but I was too scared for levity</p>
 <p>"Is this force capable of materializing itself?" J asked.</p>
 <p>"Certainly," he replied. "And it all depends on how fixed the assemblage point is. But, </p>
 <p>rest assured, if you are capable of maintaining a degree of detachment, nothing happens. </p>
 <p>The emissary remains what it is: an impersonal force that acts on us because of the </p>
 <p>fixation of our assemblage points."</p>
 <p>"Is its advice safe and sound?"</p>
 <p>"It cannot be advice. It only tells us what's what, and then we draw the inferences </p>
 <p>ourselves."</p>
 <p>I told don Juan then about what the voice had said to me.</p>
 <p>"It's just like I said," don Juan remarked. "The emissary didn't tell you anything new. Its </p>
 <p>statements were correct, but it only seemed to be revealing things to you. What the </p>
 <p>emissary did was merely repeat what you already knew."</p>
 <p>"I'm afraid I can't claim that I knew all that, don Juan."</p>
 <p>"Yes, you can. You know now infinitely more about the mystery of the universe than </p>
 <p>what you rationally suspect. But that's our human malady, to know more about the </p>
 <p>mystery of the universe than we suspect."</p>
 <p>Having experienced this incredible phenomenon all by myself, without don Juan's </p>
 <p>coaching, made me feel elated. I wanted more information about the emissary. I began to </p>
 <p>ask don Juan whether he also heard the emissary's voice.</p>
 <p>He interrupted me and with a broad smile said, "Yes, yes. The emissary also talks to me. </p>
 <p>In my youth I used to see it as a friar with a black cowl. A talking friar who used to scare </p>
 <p>the daylights out of me, every time. Then, when my fear was more manageable, it </p>
 <p>became a disembodied voice, which tells me things to this day."</p>
 <p>"What kinds of things, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Anything I focus my intent on, things I don't want to take the trouble of following up </p>
 <p>myself. Like, for example, details about the behavior of my apprentices. What they do </p>
 <p>when I am not around. It tells me things about you, in particular. The emissary tells me </p>
 <p>everything you do."</p>
 <p>At that point, I really did not care for the direction our conversation had taken. I </p>
 <p>frantically searched my mind for questions about other topics while he roared with </p>
 <p>laughter.</p>
 <p>"Is the dreaming emissary an inorganic being?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Let's say that the dreaming emissary is a force that comes from the realm of inorganic </p>
 <p>beings. This is the reason dreamers always encounter it."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that every dreamer hears or sees the emissary?"</p>
 <p>"Everyone hears the emissary; very few see it or feel it."</p>
 <p>"Do you have any explanation for this?"</p>
 <p>"No. Besides, I really don't care about the emissary. At one point in my life, I had to </p>
 <p>make a decision whether to concentrate on the inorganic beings and follow in the </p>
 <p>footsteps of the old sorcerers or to refuse it all. My teacher, the nagual Julian, helped me </p>
 <p>make up my mind to refuse it. I've never regretted that decision."</p>
 <p>"Do you think I should refuse the inorganic beings myself, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>He did not answer me; instead, he explained that the whole realm of inorganic beings is </p>
 <p>always poised to teach. Perhaps because inorganic beings have a deeper consciousness </p>
 <p>than ours, they feel compelled to take us under their wings.</p>
 <p>"I didn't see any point in becoming their pupil," he added. "Their price is too high."</p>
 <p>"What is their price?"</p>
 <p>"Our lives, our energy, our devotion to them. In other words, our freedom."</p>
 <p>"But what do they teach?"</p>
 <p>"Things pertinent to their world. The same way we ourselves would teach them, if we </p>
 <p>were capable of teaching them, things pertinent to our world. Their method, however, is </p>
 <p>to take our basic self as a gauge of what we need and then teach us accordingly. A most </p>
 <p>dangerous affair!"</p>
 <p>"I don't see why it would be dangerous</p>
 <p>"If someone was going to take your basic self as a gauge, with all your fears and greed </p>
 <p>and envy, et cetera, et cetera, and teach you what fulfills that horrible state of being, what </p>
 <p>do you think the result would be?"</p>
 <p>I had no comeback. I thought I understood perfectly well the reasons for his rejection.</p>
 <p>"The problem with the old sorcerers was that they learned wonderful things, but on the </p>
 <p>basis of their unadulterated lower selves," don Juan went on. "The inorganic beings </p>
 <p>became their allies, and, by means of deliberate examples, they taught the old sorcerers </p>
 <p>marvels. Their allies performed the actions, and the old sorcerers were guided step by </p>
 <p>step to copy those actions, without changing anything about their basic nature."</p>
 <p>"Do these relationships with inorganic beings exist today?"</p>
 <p>"I can't answer that truthfully. All I can say is that I can't conceive of having a </p>
 <p>relationship like that myself. Involvements of this nature curtail our search for freedom </p>
 <p>by consuming all our available energy. In order to really follow their allies' example, the </p>
 <p>old sorcerers had to spend their lives in the realm of the inorganic beings. The amount of </p>
 <p>energy needed to accomplish such a sustained journey is staggering."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that the old sorcerers were able to exist in those realms like we </p>
 <p>exist here?"</p>
 <p>"Not quite like we exist here, but certainly they lived: they retained their awareness, their </p>
 <p>individuality. The dreaming emissary became the most vital entity for those sorcerers. If </p>
 <p>a sorcerer wants to live in the realm of the inorganic beings, the emissary is the perfect </p>
 <p>bridge; it speaks, and its bent is to teach, to guide."</p>
 <p>"Have you ever been in that realm, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Countless times. And so have you. But there is no point in talking about it now. You </p>
 <p>haven't cleared all the debris from your dreaming attention yet. We'll talk about that </p>
 <p>realm some day."</p>
 <p>"Do I gather, don Juan, that you don't approve of or like the emissary?"</p>
 <p>"I neither approve of it nor like it. It belongs to another mood, the old sorcerers' mood. </p>
 <p>Besides, its teachings and guidance in our world are nonsense. And for that nonsense the </p>
 <p>emissary charges us enormities in terms of energy. One day you will agree with me. </p>
 <p>You'll see."</p>
 <p>In the tone of don Juan's words, I caught a veiled implication of his belief that I disagreed </p>
 <p>with him about the emissary. I was about to confront him with it when I heard the </p>
 <p>emissary's voice in my ears. "He's right," the voice said. "You like me because you find </p>
 <p>nothing wrong with exploring all possibilities. You want knowledge; knowledge is </p>
 <p>power. You don't want to remain safe in the routines and beliefs of your daily world."</p>
 <p>The emissary said all that in English with a marked Pacific Coast intonation. Then it </p>
 <p>shifted into Spanish. I heard a slight Argentine accent. I had never heard the emissary </p>
 <p>speaking like this before. It fascinated me. The emissary told me about fulfillment, </p>
 <p>knowledge; about how far away I was from my birth place; about my craving for </p>
 <p>adventure and my near obsession with new things, new horizons. The voice even talked </p>
 <p>to me in Portuguese, with a definite inflection from the southern pampas.</p>
 <p>To hear that voice pouring out all this flattery not only scared me but nauseated me. I told </p>
 <p>don Juan, right on the spot, that I had to stop my dreaming training. He looked up at me, </p>
 <p>caught by surprise. But when I repeated what I had heard, he agreed I should stop, </p>
 <p>although I sensed he was doing it only to appease me.</p>
 <p>A few weeks later, I found my reaction a bit hysterical and my decision to withdraw </p>
 <p>unsound. I went back to my dreaming practices. I was sure don Juan was aware that I had </p>
 <p>canceled out my withdrawal.</p>
 <p>On one of my visits to him, quite abruptly, he spoke about dreams. "Just because we </p>
 <p>haven't been taught to emphasize dreams as a genuine field for exploration doesn't mean </p>
 <p>they are not one," he began. "Dreams are analyzed for their meaning or are taken as </p>
 <p>portents, but never are they taken as a realm of real events.</p>
 <p>"To my knowledge, only the old sorcerers did that," don Juan went on, "but at the end </p>
 <p>they flubbed it. They got greedy, and when they came to a crucial crossroads, they took </p>
 <p>the wrong fork. They put all their eggs in one basket: the fixation of the assemblage point </p>
 <p>on the thousands of positions it can adopt."</p>
 <p>Don Juan expressed his bewilderment at the fact that out of all the marvelous things the </p>
 <p>old sorcerers learned exploring those thousands of positions, only the art of dreaming and </p>
 <p>the art of stalking remain. He reiterated that the art of dreaming is concerned with the </p>
 <p>displacement of the assemblage point. Then he defined stalking as the art that deals with </p>
 <p>the fixation of the assemblage point on any location to which it is displaced.</p>
 <p>"To fixate the assemblage point on any new spot means to acquire cohesion," he said. </p>
 <p>"You have been doing just that in your dreaming practices."</p>
 <p>"I thought I was perfecting my energy body," I said, some how surprised at his statement.</p>
 <p>"You are doing that and much more; you are learning to have cohesion. Dreaming does it </p>
 <p>by forcing dreamers to fixate the assemblage point. The dreaming attention, the energy </p>
 <p>body, the second attention, the relationship with inorganic beings, the dreaming emissary </p>
 <p>are but by-products of acquir ing cohesion; in other words, they are all by-products of </p>
 <p>fixat ing the assemblage point on a number of dreaming positions."</p>
 <p>"What is a dreaming position, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Any new position to which the assemblage point has been displaced during sleep."</p>
 <p>"How do we fixate the assemblage point on a dreaming posi tion?"</p>
 <p>"By sustaining the view of any item in your dreams, or by changing dreams at will. </p>
 <p>Through your dreaming practices, you are really exercising your capacity to be cohesive; </p>
 <p>that is to say, you are exercising your capacity to maintain a new energy shape by holding </p>
 <p>the assemblage point fixed on the position of any particular dream you are having."</p>
 <p>"Do I really maintain a new energy shape?"</p>
 <p>"Not exactly, and not because you can't but only because you are shifting the assemblage </p>
 <p>point instead of moving it. Shifts of the assemblage point give rise to minute changes, </p>
 <p>which are practically unnoticeable. The challenge of shifts is that they are so small and so </p>
 <p>numerous that to maintain cohesiveness in all of them is a triumph."</p>
 <p>"How do we know we are maintaining cohesion?"</p>
 <p>"We know it by the clarity of our perception. The clearer the view of our dreams, the </p>
 <p>greater our cohesion."</p>
 <p>He said then that it was time for me to have a practical application of what I had learned </p>
 <p>in dreaming. Without giving me a chance to ask anything, he urged me to focus my </p>
 <p>attention, as if I were in a dream, on the foliage of a desert tree growing nearby: a </p>
 <p>mesquite tree.</p>
 <p>"Do you want me to just gaze at it?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"I don't want you to just gaze at it; I want you to do some thing very special with that </p>
 <p>foliage," he said. "Remember that, in your dreams, once you are able to hold the view of </p>
 <p>any item, you are really holding the dreaming position of your assemblage point. Now, </p>
 <p>gaze at those leaves as if you were in a dream, but with a slight yet most meaningful </p>
 <p>variation: you are going to hold your dreaming attention on the leaves of the mesquite </p>
 <p>tree in the awareness of our daily world."</p>
 <p>My nervousness made it impossible for me to follow his line of thought. He patiently </p>
 <p>explained that by staring at the foliage, I would accomplish a minute displacement of my </p>
 <p>assemblage point. Then, by summoning my dreaming attention through staring at </p>
 <p>individual leaves, I would actually fixate that minute displacement, and my cohesion </p>
 <p>would make me perceive in terms of the second attention. He added, with a chuckle, that </p>
 <p>the process was so simple it was ridiculous.</p>
 <p>Don Juan was right. All I needed was to focus my sight on the leaves, maintain it, and in </p>
 <p>one instant I was drawn into a vortex-like sensation, extremely like the vortexes in my </p>
 <p>dreams. The foliage of the mesquite tree became a universe of sensory data. It was as if </p>
 <p>the foliage had swallowed me, but it was not only my sight that was engaged; if I touched </p>
 <p>the leaves, I actu ally felt them. I could also smell them. My dreaming attention was </p>
 <p>multisensorial instead of solely visual, as in my regular dreaming.</p>
 <p>What had begun as gazing at the foliage of the mesquite tree had turned into a dream. I </p>
 <p>believed I was in a dreamt tree, as I had been in trees of countless dreams. And, naturally, </p>
 <p>I behaved in this dreamt tree as I had learned to behave in my dreams; I moved from item </p>
 <p>to item, pulled by the force of a vor tex that took shape on whatever part of the tree I </p>
 <p>focused my multisensorial dreaming attention. Vortexes were formed not only on gazing </p>
 <p>but also on touching anything with any part of my body.</p>
 <p>In the midst of this vision or dream, I had an attack of rational doubts. I began to wonder </p>
 <p>if I had really climbed the tree in a daze and was actually hugging the leaves, lost in the </p>
 <p>foliage, without knowing what I was doing. Or perhaps I had fallen asleep, possibly </p>
 <p>mesmerized by the fluttering of leaves in the wind, and was having a dream. But just like </p>
 <p>in dreaming, I didn't have enough energy to ponder for too long. My thoughts were </p>
 <p>fleeting. They lasted an instant; then the force of direct experience blanketed them out </p>
 <p>completely.</p>
 <p>A sudden motion around me shook everything and virtually made me emerge from a </p>
 <p>dump of leaves, as if I had broken away from the tree's magnetic pull. I was facing then, </p>
 <p>from an elevation, an immense horizon. Dark mountains and green vegetation surrounded </p>
 <p>me. Another jolt of energy made me shake from my bones out; then I was somewhere </p>
 <p>else. Enormous trees loomed everywhere. They were bigger than the Douglas firs of </p>
 <p>Oregon and Washington State. Never had I seen a forest like that. The scenery was such a </p>
 <p>contrast to the aridness of the Sonoran desert that it left me with no doubt that I was </p>
 <p>having a dream.</p>
 <p>I held on to that extraordinary view, afraid to let go, knowing that it was indeed a dream </p>
 <p>and would disappear once I had run out of dreaming attention. But the images lasted, </p>
 <p>even when I thought I should have run out of dreaming attention. A horrifying thought </p>
 <p>crossed my mind then: what if this was neither a dream nor the daily world?</p>
 <p>Frightened, as an animal must experience fright, I recoiled into the dump of leaves I had </p>
 <p>emerged from. The momentum of my backward motion kept me going through the tree </p>
 <p>foliage and around the hard branches. It pulled me away from the tree, and in one split </p>
 <p>second I was standing next to don Juan, at the door of his house, in the desert in Sonora.</p>
 <p>I instantly realized I had entered again into a state in which I could think coherently, but I </p>
 <p>could not talk. Don Juan told me not to worry He said that our speech faculty is </p>
 <p>extremely flimsy and attacks of muteness are common among sorcerers who venture </p>
 <p>beyond the limits of normal perception.</p>
 <p>My gut feeling was that don Juan had taken pity on me and had decided to give me a pep </p>
 <p>talk. But the voice of the dreaming emissary, which I clearly heard at that instant, said </p>
 <p>that in a few hours and after some rest I was going to be perfectly well.</p>
 <p>Upon awakening I gave don Juan, at his request, a complete description of what I had </p>
 <p>seen and done. He warned me that it was not possible to rely on my rationality to </p>
 <p>understand my experience, not because my rationality was in any way impaired but </p>
 <p>because what had taken place was a phenomenon outside the parameters of reason.</p>
 <p>I, naturally, argued that nothing can be outside the limits of reason; things can be obscure, </p>
 <p>but sooner or later reason always finds a way to shed light on anything. And I really </p>
 <p>believed this.</p>
 <p>Don Juan, with extreme patience, pointed out that reason is only a by-product of the </p>
 <p>habitual position of the assemblage point; therefore, knowing what is going on, being of </p>
 <p>sound mind, having our feet on the ground-sources of great pride to us and assumed to </p>
 <p>be a natural consequence of our worth-are merely the result of the fixation of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point on its habitual place. The more rigid and stationary it is, the greater our </p>
 <p>confidence in ourselves, the greater our feeling of knowing the world, of being able to </p>
 <p>predict.</p>
 <p>He added that what dreaming does is give us the fluidity to enter into other worlds by </p>
 <p>destroying our sense of knowing this world. He called dreaming a journey of unthinkable </p>
 <p>dimen sions, a journey that, after making us perceive everything we can humanly </p>
 <p>perceive, makes the assemblage point jump out side the human domain and perceive the </p>
 <p>inconceivable.</p>
 <p>"We are back again, harping on the most important topic of the sorcerers' world," he </p>
 <p>went on, "the position of the assem blage point. The old sorcerers' curse, as well as </p>
 <p>mankind's thorn in the side."</p>
 <p>"Why do you say that, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Because both, mankind in general and the old sorcerers, fell prey to the position of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point: mankind, because by not knowing that the assemblage point exists we </p>
 <p>are obliged to take the by-product of its habitual position as something final and </p>
 <p>indisputable. And the old sorcerers because, although they knew all about the assemblage </p>
 <p>point, they fell for its facility to be manipulated.</p>
 <p>"You must avoid falling into those traps," he continued. "It'd be really disgusting if you </p>
 <p>sided with mankind, as if you didn't know about the existence of the assemblage point. </p>
 <p>But it'd be even more insidious if you sided with the old sorcerers and cynically </p>
 <p>manipulate the assemblage point for gain."</p>
 <p>"I still don't understand. What is the connection of all this with what I experienced </p>
 <p>yesterday?"</p>
 <p>"Yesterday, you were in a different world. But if you ask me where that world is, and I </p>
 <p>tell you that it is in the position of the assemblage point, my answer won't make any </p>
 <p>sense to you."</p>
 <p>Don Juan's argument was that I had two choices. One was to follow mankind's rationales </p>
 <p>and be faced with a predicament: my experience would tell me that other worlds exist, </p>
 <p>but my reason would say that such worlds do not and cannot exist. The other choice was </p>
 <p>to follow the old sorcerers' rationales, in which case I would automatically accept the </p>
 <p>existence of other worlds, and my greed alone would make my assemblage point hold on </p>
 <p>to the position that creates those worlds. The result would he another kind of </p>
 <p>predicament: that of having to move physically into visionlike realms, driven by </p>
 <p>expectations of power and gain.</p>
 <p>I was too numb to follow his argument, but then I realized I did not have to follow it </p>
 <p>because I agreed with him completely, despite the fact that I did not have a total picture </p>
 <p>of what I was agreeing about. Agreeing with him was rather a feeling that came from far </p>
 <p>away, an ancient certainty I had lost, which was now slowly finding its way back to me.</p>
 <p>The return to my dreaming practices eliminated these turmoils, but created new ones. For </p>
 <p>example, after months of hearing it daily, I stopped finding the dreaming emissary's </p>
 <p>voice an annoyance or a wonder. It became a matter of course for me. And I made so </p>
 <p>many mistakes influenced by what it said that I almost understood don Juan's reluctance </p>
 <p>to take it seriously. A psychoanalyst would have had a field day interpreting the emissary </p>
 <p>according to all the possible permutations of my intrapersonal dynamics.</p>
 <p>Don Juan maintained a steadfast view on it: it is an impersonal but constant force from </p>
 <p>the realm of inorganic beings; thus, every dreamer experiences it, in more or less the </p>
 <p>same terms. And if we choose to take its words as advice, we are incurable fools.</p>
 <p>I was definitely one of them. There was no way I could have remained impassive being in </p>
 <p>direct contact with such an extraordinary event: a voice that clearly and concisely told me </p>
 <p>in three languages hidden things about anything or anyone I focused my attention on. Its </p>
 <p>only drawback, which was of no consequence to me, was that we were not synchronized. </p>
 <p>The emissary used to tell me things about people or events when I had honestly forgotten </p>
 <p>I had been interested in them.</p>
 <p>I asked don Juan about this oddity and he said that it had to do with the rigidity of my </p>
 <p>assemblage point. He explained that I had been reared by old adults and that they had </p>
 <p>imbued me with old people's views; therefore, I was dangerously righteous. His urge to </p>
 <p>give me potions of hallucinogenic plants was but an effort, he said, to shake my </p>
 <p>assemblage point and allow it to have a minimal margin of fluidity</p>
 <p>"If you don't develop this margin," he went on, "either you'll become more righteous or </p>
 <p>you'll become a hysterical sorcerer. My interest in telling you about the old sorcerers is </p>
 <p>not to bad-mouth them but to pit them against you. Sooner or later, your assemblage </p>
 <p>point will be more fluid, but not fluid enough to offset your facility to be like them: </p>
 <p>righteous and hysterical."</p>
 <p>"How can I avoid all that, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"There is only one way. Sorcerers call it sheer understanding. I call it a romance with </p>
 <p>knowledge. It's the drive sorcerers use to know, to discover, to be bewildered."</p>
 <p>Don Juan changed the subject and continued to explain the fixation of the assemblage </p>
 <p>point. He said that seeing children's assemblage points constantly fluttering, as if moved </p>
 <p>by tremors, changing their place with ease, the old sorcerers came to - the conclusion that </p>
 <p>the assemblage point's habitual location is not innate but brought about by habituation. </p>
 <p>Seeing also that only in adults is it fixed on one spot, they surmised that the specific </p>
 <p>location of the assemblage point fosters a specific way of perceiving. Through usage, this </p>
 <p>specific way of perceiving becomes a system of interpreting sensory data.</p>
 <p>Don Juan pointed out that, since we are drafted into that sys tem by being born into it, </p>
 <p>from the moment of our birth we imperatively strive to adjust our perceiving to conform </p>
 <p>to the demands of this system, a system that rules us for life. Consequently, the old </p>
 <p>sorcerers were thoroughly right in believing that the act of countermanding it and </p>
 <p>perceiving energy directly is what transforms a person into a sorcerer.</p>
 <p>Don Juan expressed wonder at what he called the greatest accomplishment of our human </p>
 <p>upbringing: to lock our assemblage point on its habitual position. For, once it is </p>
 <p>immobilized there, our perception can be coached and guided to interpret what we </p>
 <p>perceive. In other words, we can then be guided to perceive more in terms of our system </p>
 <p>than in terms of our senses. He assured me that human perception is universally </p>
 <p>homogeneous, because the assemblage points of the whole human race are fixed on the </p>
 <p>same spot.</p>
 <p>He went on to say that sorcerers prove all this to themselves when they see that at the </p>
 <p>moment the assemblage point is displaced beyond a certain threshold, and new universal </p>
 <p>filaments of energy begin to be perceived, there is no sense to what we perceive. The </p>
 <p>immediate cause is that new sensory data has rendered our system inoperative; it can no </p>
 <p>longer be used to interpret what we are perceiving.</p>
 <p>"Perceiving without our system is, of course, chaotic," don Juan continued. "But </p>
 <p>strangely enough, when we think we have truly lost our bearings, our old system rallies; </p>
 <p>it comes to our rescue and transforms our new incomprehensible perception into a </p>
 <p>thoroughly comprehensible new world. Just like what happened to you when you gazed </p>
 <p>at the leaves of the mesquite tree."</p>
 <p>"What exactly happened to me, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Your perception was chaotic for a while; everything came to you at once, and your </p>
 <p>system for interpreting the world didn't function. Then, the chaos cleared up, and there </p>
 <p>you were in front of a new world."</p>
 <p>"We are again, don Juan, at the same place we were before. Does that world exist, or is it </p>
 <p>merely my mind that concocted it?"</p>
 <p>"We certainly are back, and the answer is still the same. It exists in the precise position </p>
 <p>your assemblage point was at that moment. In order to perceive it, you needed cohesion, </p>
 <p>that is, you needed to maintain your assemblage point fixed on that position, which you </p>
 <p>did. The result was that you totally per ceived a new world for a while."</p>
 <p>"But would others perceive that same world?"</p>
 <p>"If they had uniformity and cohesion, they would. Uniformity is to hold, in unison, the </p>
 <p>same position of the assemblage point. The old sorcerers called the entire act of acquiring </p>
 <p>uniformity and cohesion outside the normal world stalking perception.</p>
 <p>"The art of stalking," he continued, "as I have already said, deals with the fixation of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point. The old sorcerers discovered, through practice, that important as it is to </p>
 <p>dis place the assemblage point, it is even more important to make it stay fixed on its new </p>
 <p>position, wherever that new position might be."</p>
 <p>He explained that if the assemblage point does not become stationary, there is no way </p>
 <p>that we can perceive coherently. We would experience then a kaleidoscope of </p>
 <p>disassociated images. This is the reason the old sorcerers put as much emphasis on </p>
 <p>dreaming as they did on stalking. One art cannot exist without the other, especially for </p>
 <p>the kinds of activities in which the old sorcerers were involved.</p>
 <p>"What were those activities, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"The old sorcerers called them the intricacies of the second attention or the grand </p>
 <p>adventure of the unknown."</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that these activities stem from the displace ments of the assemblage point. </p>
 <p>Not only had the old sorcerers learned to displace their assemblage points to thousands of </p>
 <p>positions on the surface or on the inside of their energy masses but they had also learned </p>
 <p>to fixate their assemblage points on those positions, and thus retain their cohesiveness, </p>
 <p>indefinitely.</p>
 <p>"What was the benefit of that, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"We can't talk about benefits. We can talk only about end results."</p>
 <p>He explained that the cohesiveness of the old sorcerers was such that it allowed them to </p>
 <p>become perceptually and physically everything the specific position of their assemblage </p>
 <p>points dictated. They could transform themselves into anything for which they had a </p>
 <p>specific inventory. An inventory is, he said, all the details of perception involved in </p>
 <p>becoming, for example, a jaguar, a bird, an insect, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
 <p>"It's very hard for me to believe that this transformation can be possible," I said.</p>
 <p>"It is possible," he assured me. "Not so much for you and me, but for them. For them, it </p>
 <p>was nothing."</p>
 <p>He said that the old sorcerers had superb fluidity. All they needed was the slightest shift </p>
 <p>of their assemblage points, the slightest perceptual cue from their dreaming, and they </p>
 <p>would instantaneously stalk their perception, rearrange their cohesiveness to fit their new </p>
 <p>state of awareness, and be an animal, another person, a bird, or anything.</p>
 <p>"But isn't that what mentally ill people do? Make up their own reality as they go along?" </p>
 <p>I said.</p>
 <p>"No, it isn't the same. Insane people imagine a reality of their own because they don't </p>
 <p>have any preconceived purpose at all. Insane people bring chaos into the chaos. </p>
 <p>Sorcerers, on the contrary, bring order to the chaos. Their preconceived, transcendental </p>
 <p>purpose is to free their perception. Sorcerers don't make up the world they are </p>
 <p>perceiving; they perceive energy directly, and then they discover that what they are </p>
 <p>perceiving is an unknown new world, which can swallow them whole, because it is as </p>
 <p>real as anything we know to be real."</p>
 <p>Don Juan then gave me a new version of what had happened to me as I gazed at the </p>
 <p>mesquite tree. He said that I began by perceiving the energy of the tree. On the subjective </p>
 <p>level, how ever, I believed I was dreaming because I employed dreaming techniques to </p>
 <p>perceive energy, He asserted that to use dreaming techniques in the world of everyday </p>
 <p>life was one of the old sorcerers' most effective devices. It made perceiving energy </p>
 <p>directly dreamlike, instead of totally chaotic, until a moment when some thing rearranged </p>
 <p>perception and the sorcerer found himself facing a new world-the very thing that had </p>
 <p>happened to me.</p>
 <p>I told him about the thought I'd had, which I had barely dared to think: that the scenery I </p>
 <p>was viewing was not a dream, nor was it our daily world.</p>
 <p>"It wasn't," he said. "I've been saying this to you over and over, and you think that I am </p>
 <p>merely repeating myself. I know how difficult it is for the mind to allow mindless </p>
 <p>possibilities to become real. But new worlds exist! They are wrapped one around the </p>
 <p>other, like the skins of an onion. The world we exist in is but one of those skins."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that the goal of your teaching is to prepare me to go into those </p>
 <p>worlds?"</p>
 <p>"No. I don't mean that. We go into those worlds only as an exercise. Those journeys are </p>
 <p>the antecedents of the sorcerers of today. We do the same dreaming that the old sorcerers </p>
 <p>used to do, but at one moment we deviate into new ground. The old sorcerers preferred </p>
 <p>the shifts of the assemblage point, so they were always on more or less known, </p>
 <p>predictable ground. We prefer the movements of the assemblage point. The old sorcerers </p>
 <p>were after the human unknown. We are after the nonhuman unknown."</p>
 <p>"I haven't gotten to that yet, have I?"</p>
 <p>"No. You are only beginning. And at the beginning everyone has to go through the old </p>
 <p>sorcerers' steps. After all, they were the ones who invented dreaming."</p>
 <p>"At what point will I then begin to learn the new sorcerers' brand of dreaming?"</p>
 <p>"You have enormous ground yet to cover. Years from now perhaps. Besides, in your </p>
 <p>case, I have to be extraordinarily careful. In character, you are definitely linked to the old </p>
 <p>sorcerers. I've said this to you before, but you always manage to avoid my probes. </p>
 <p>Sometimes I even think that some alien energy is advising you, but then I discard the </p>
 <p>idea. You are not devious."</p>
 <p>"What are you talking about, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"You've done, unwittingly, two things that worry the hell out of me. You traveled with </p>
 <p>your energy body to a place outside this world the first time you dreamt. And you walked </p>
 <p>there! And then you traveled with your energy body to another place outside this world, </p>
 <p>but parting from the awareness of the daily world."</p>
 <p>"Why would that worry you, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Dreaming is too easy for you. And that is a damnation if we don't watch it. It leads to </p>
 <p>the human unknown. As I said to you, modern-day sorcerers strive to get to the </p>
 <p>nonhuman unknown."</p>
 <p>"What can the nonhuman unknown be?"</p>
 <p>"Freedom from being human. Inconceivable worlds that are outside the band of man but </p>
 <p>that we still can perceive. This is where modern sorcerers take the side road. Their </p>
 <p>predilection is what's outside the human domain. And what are outside that domain are </p>
 <p>all-inclusive worlds, not merely the realm of birds or the realm of animals or the realm of </p>
 <p>man, even if it be the unknown man. What I am talking about are worlds, like the one </p>
 <p>where we live; total worlds with endless realms."</p>
 <p>"Where are those worlds, don Juan? In different positions of the assemblage point?"</p>
 <p>"Right. In different positions of the assemblage point, but positions sorcerers arrive at </p>
 <p>with a movement of the assemblage point, not a shift. Entering into those worlds is the </p>
 <p>type of dreaming only sorcerers of today do. The old sorcerers stayed away from it, </p>
 <p>because it requires a great deal of detachment and no self-importance whatsoever. A price </p>
 <p>they couldn't afford to pay.</p>
 <p>"For the sorcerers who practice dreaming today, dreaming is freedom to perceive worlds </p>
 <p>beyond the imagination."</p>
 <p>"But, what's the point of perceiving all that?"</p>
 <p>"You already asked me, today, the same question. You speak like a true merchant. </p>
 <p>What's the risk? you ask, What's the percentage gain to my investment? Is it going to </p>
 <p>better me?</p>
 <p>"There is no way to answer that. The merchant mind does commerce. But freedom cannot </p>
 <p>be an investment. Freedom is an adventure with no end, in which we risk our lives and </p>
 <p>much more for a few moments of something beyond words, beyond thoughts or </p>
 <p>feelings."</p>
 <p>"I didn't ask that question in that spirit, don Juan. What I want to know is what can be the </p>
 <p>driving force to do all this for a lazy bum like myself?"</p>
 <p>"To seek freedom is the only driving force I know. Freedom to fly off into that infinity </p>
 <p>out there. Freedom to dissolve; to lift off; to be like the flame of a candle, which, in spite </p>
 <p>of being up against the light of a billion stars, remains intact, because it never pretended </p>
 <p>to be more than what it is: a mere candle."</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 5</p>
 <p>THE WORLD OF INORGANIC BEINGS</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Faithful to my agreement to wait for don Juan to initiate any comment on dreaming, only </p>
 <p>in cases of necessity did I ask him for advice. Ordinarily, though, he not only seemed </p>
 <p>reluctant to touch the subject but was somehow displeased with me about it. In my </p>
 <p>estimation, a confirmation of his disapproval was the fact that whenever we talked about </p>
 <p>my dreaming activities, he always minimized the import of anything I had accomplished.</p>
 <p>For me, at that time, the animate existence of inorganic beings had become the most </p>
 <p>crucial aspect of my dreaming practices. After encountering them in my dreams, and </p>
 <p>especially after my bout with them in the desert around don Juan's,</p>
 <p>house, I should have been more willing to take their existence as a serious affair. But all </p>
 <p>these events had quite the opposite effect on me. I became adamant and doggedly denied </p>
 <p>the possibility that they existed.</p>
 <p>Then I had a change of heart and decided to conduct an objective inquiry about them. The </p>
 <p>method of this inquiry required that I first compile a record of everything that transpired </p>
 <p>in my dreaming sessions, then use that record as a matrix to find out if my dreaming </p>
 <p>proved or disproved anything about the inorganic beings. I actually wrote down hundreds </p>
 <p>of pages of meticulous but meaningless details, when it should have been clear to me that </p>
 <p>the evidence of their existence had been gathered almost as soon as I had started my </p>
 <p>inquiry</p>
 <p>It took but a few sessions for me to discover that what I thought to be don Juan's casual </p>
 <p>recommendation-to suspend judgment and let the inorganic beings come to me-was, </p>
 <p>in fact, the very procedure used by the sorcerers of antiquity to attract them. By leaving </p>
 <p>me to find it out for myself, don Juan was simply following his sorcery training. He had </p>
 <p>remarked time and time again that it is very difficult to make the self give up its </p>
 <p>strongholds except through practice. One of the self's strongest lines of defense is indeed </p>
 <p>our rationality and this is not only the most durable line of defense when it comes to </p>
 <p>sorcery actions and explanations but also the most threatened. Don Juan believed that the </p>
 <p>existence of inorganic beings is a foremost assailant of our rationality.</p>
 <p>In my dreaming practices, I had an established course, which I followed every single day </p>
 <p>without deviation. I aimed first at observing every conceivable item of my dreams, then </p>
 <p>at changing dreams. I can say in sincerity that I observed universes of detail in dreams </p>
 <p>upon dreams. As a matter of course, at one given moment my dreaming attention began </p>
 <p>to wane, and my dreaming sessions ended either in my falling asleep and having regular </p>
 <p>dreams, in which I had no dreaming attention whatsoever, or in my waking up and not </p>
 <p>being able to sleep at all.</p>
 <p>From time to time, however, as don Juan had described it, a current of foreign energy, a </p>
 <p>scout, as he called it, was injected into my dreams. Being forewarned helped me to adjust </p>
 <p>my dreaming attention and be on the alert. The first time I noticed foreign energy, I was </p>
 <p>dreaming about shop ping in a department store.. I was going from counter to counter </p>
 <p>looking for antiques. I finally found one. The incongruence of looking for antiques in a </p>
 <p>department store was so obvious that it made me chuckle, but since I had found one, I </p>
 <p>forgot about that incongruence. The antique was the handle of a walking stick. The </p>
 <p>salesman told me that it was made of iridium, which he called one of the hardest </p>
 <p>substances in the world. It was a carved piece: the head and shoulders of a monkey. It </p>
 <p>looked like jade to me. The salesman was insulted when I insinuated that it might be jade, </p>
 <p>and to prove his point he hurled the object, with all his strength, against the cement floor. </p>
 <p>It did not break but bounced like a ball and then sailed away, spinning like a Frisbee. I </p>
 <p>followed it. It disappeared behind some trees. I ran to look for it, and I found it, stuck on </p>
 <p>the ground. It had been transformed into an extraordinarily beautiful, deep green and </p>
 <p>black, full-length walking stick.</p>
 <p>I coveted it. I grabbed it and struggled to pull it out of the ground before anyone else </p>
 <p>came along. But, hard as I tried, I could not make it budge. I was afraid I would break it if </p>
 <p>I attempted to pry it loose by shaking it back and forth. So I began to dig around it with </p>
 <p>my bare hands. As I kept on digging, it kept on melting, until only a puddle of green </p>
 <p>water was left in its place. I stared at the water; it suddenly seemed to explode. It turned </p>
 <p>into a white bubble, and then it was gone. My dream continued into other images and </p>
 <p>details, which were not out standing, although they were crystal clear.</p>
 <p>When I told don Juan about this dream, he said, "You isolated a scout. Scouts are more </p>
 <p>numerous when our dreams are average, normal ones. The dreams of dreamers are </p>
 <p>strangely</p>
 <p>free from scouts. When they appear, they are identifiable by the strangeness and </p>
 <p>incongruity surrounding them."</p>
 <p>"Incongruity, in what manner, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Their presence doesn't make any sense."</p>
 <p>"Very few things make sense in a dream."</p>
 <p>"Only in average dreams are things nonsensical. I would say that this is so because more </p>
 <p>scouts are injected then, because average people are 'subject to a greater barrage from the </p>
 <p>unknown."</p>
 <p>"Do you know why is that so, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"In my opinion, what takes place is a balance of forces. Aver age people have </p>
 <p>stupendously strong barriers to protect them selves against those onslaughts. Barriers </p>
 <p>such as worries about the self. The stronger the barrier, the greater the attack.</p>
 <p>"Dreamers, by contrast, have fewer barriers and fewer scouts in their dreams. It seems </p>
 <p>that in dreamers' dreams nonsensical things disappear, perhaps to ensure that dreamers </p>
 <p>catch the presence of scouts."</p>
 <p>Don Juan advised me to pay close attention and remember every single possible detail of </p>
 <p>the dream I had had. He even made me repeat what I had told him.</p>
 <p>"You baffle me," I said. "You don't want to hear anything about my dreaming, and then </p>
 <p>you do. Is there any order to your refusals and acceptances?"</p>
 <p>"You bet there is order behind all this," he said. "Chances are, you'll do the same </p>
 <p>someday to another dreamer. Some items are of key importance because they are </p>
 <p>associated with the spirit. Others are entirely unimportant by reason of being associated </p>
 <p>with our indulging personality</p>
 <p>"The first scout you isolate will always be present, in any form, even iridium. By the </p>
 <p>way, what's iridium?"</p>
 <p>"I don't really know," I said in total sincerity</p>
 <p>"There you are! And what will you say if it turns out to be one of the strongest substances </p>
 <p>in the world?"</p>
 <p>Don Juan's eyes shone with delight, while I nervously laughed at that absurd possibility, </p>
 <p>which, I learned later, is true. I began to notice from then on the presence of incongruous</p>
 <p>items in my dreams. Once I had accepted don Juan's categorization of foreign energy in </p>
 <p>dreams, I totally agreed with him that incongruous items were foreign invaders of my </p>
 <p>dreams. Upon isolating them, my dreaming attention always focused on them with an </p>
 <p>intensity that did not occur under any other circumstances.</p>
 <p>Another thing I noticed was that every time foreign energy invaded my dreams, my </p>
 <p>dreaming attention had to work hard to turn it into a known object. The handicap of my </p>
 <p>dreaming attention was its inability to accomplish fully such a transformation; the end </p>
 <p>result was a bastardized item, nearly un known to me. The foreign energy then dissipated </p>
 <p>quite easily; the bastardized item vanished, turning into a blob of light, which was </p>
 <p>quickly absorbed by other pressing details of my dreams.</p>
 <p>When I asked don Juan to comment on what was happening to me, he said, "At this point </p>
 <p>in your dreaming, scouts are reconnoiterers sent by the inorganic realm. They are very </p>
 <p>fast, meaning that they don't stay long."</p>
 <p>"Why do you say that they are reconnoiterers, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"They come in search of potential awareness. They have consciousness and purpose, </p>
 <p>although it is incomprehensible to our minds, comparable perhaps to the consciousness </p>
 <p>and purpose of trees. The inner speed of trees and inorganic beings is incomprehensible </p>
 <p>to us because it is infinitely slower than ours."</p>
 <p>"What makes you say that, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Both trees and inorganic beings last longer than we do. They are made to stay put. They </p>
 <p>are immobile, yet they make everything move around them."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that inorganic beings are stationary like trees?"</p>
 <p>"Certainly. What you see in dreaming as bright or dark sticks are their projections. What </p>
 <p>you hear as the voice of the dreaming emissary is equally their projection. And so are </p>
 <p>their scouts."</p>
 <p>For some unfathomable reason, I was overwhelmed by these statements. I was suddenly </p>
 <p>filled with anxiety. I asked don Juan if trees also had projections like that.</p>
 <p>"They do," he said. "Their projections are, however, even less friendly to us than those of </p>
 <p>the inorganic beings. Dreamers never seek them, unless they are in a state of profound </p>
 <p>amenity with trees, which is a very difficult state to attain. We have no friends on this </p>
 <p>earth, you know." He chuckled and added, "It's no mystery why."</p>
 <p>"It may not be a mystery to you, don Juan, but it certainly is to me."</p>
 <p>"We are destructive. We have antagonized every living being on this earth. That's why </p>
 <p>we have no friends."</p>
 <p>I felt so ill at ease that I wanted to stop the conversation altogether. But a compulsive </p>
 <p>urge made me return to the subject of inorganic beings. "What do you think I should do </p>
 <p>to follow the scouts?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Why in the world would you want to follow them?"</p>
 <p>"I am conducting an objective inquiry about inorganic beings."</p>
 <p>"You're pulling my leg, aren't you? I thought you were unmovable on your stand that </p>
 <p>inorganic beings don't exist."</p>
 <p>His scoffing tone and cackling laughter told me what his thoughts and feelings about my </p>
 <p>objective inquiry were.</p>
 <p>"I've changed my mind, don Juan. Now I want to explore all those possibilities."</p>
 <p>"Remember, the realm of inorganic beings was the old sorcerers' field. To get there, they </p>
 <p>tenaciously fixed their dreaming attention on the items of their dreams. In that fashion, </p>
 <p>they were able to isolate the scouts. And when they had the scouts in focus, they shouted </p>
 <p>their intent to follow them. The instant the old sorcerers voiced that intent, off they went, </p>
 <p>pulled by that foreign energy"</p>
 <p>"Is it that simple, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>88 • CARLOS CASTANEDA</p>
 <p>THE ART OF DREAMINQ .89</p>
 <p>He did not answer. He just laughed at me as if daring me to do it.</p>
 <p>At home, I tired of searching for don Juan's true meanings. I was thoroughly unwilling to </p>
 <p>consider that he might have described an actual procedure. After running out of ideas and </p>
 <p>patience, one day I let my guard down. In a dream I was having then, I was baffled by a </p>
 <p>fish that had suddenly jumped out of a pond I was walking by. The fish twitched by my </p>
 <p>feet, then flew like a colored bird, perching on a branch, still being a fish. The scene was </p>
 <p>so outlandish that my dreaming attention was galvanized. I instantly knew it was a scout. </p>
 <p>A second later, when the fish-bird turned into a point of light, I shouted my intent to </p>
 <p>follow it, and, just as don Juan had said, off I went into another world.</p>
 <p>I flew through a seemingly dark tunnel as if I were a weightless flying insect. The </p>
 <p>sensation of a tunnel ended abruptly. It was exactly as if I had been spewed out of a tube </p>
 <p>and the impulse had left me smack against an immense physical mass; I was almost </p>
 <p>touching it. I could not see the end of it in any direction I looked. The entire thing </p>
 <p>reminded me so much of science fiction movies that I was utterly convinced I was </p>
 <p>constructing the view of that mass myself, as one constructs a dream. Why not? The </p>
 <p>thought I had was that, after all, I was asleep, dreaming.</p>
 <p>I settled down to observe the details of my dream. What I was viewing looked very much </p>
 <p>like a gigantic sponge. It was porous and cavernous. I could not feel its texture, but it </p>
 <p>looked rough and fibrous. It was dark brownish in color. Then I had a momentary jolt of </p>
 <p>doubt about that silent mass being just a dream. What I was facing did not change shape. </p>
 <p>It did not move either. As I looked at it fixedly, I had the complete impression of </p>
 <p>something real but stationary; it was planted somewhere, and it had such a powerful </p>
 <p>attraction that I was incapable of deviating my dreaming attention to examine any thing </p>
 <p>else, including myself. Some strange force, which I had</p>
 <p>never before encountered in my dreaming, had me riveted down.</p>
 <p>Then I clearly felt that the mass released my dreaming attention; all my awareness </p>
 <p>focused on the scout that had taken me there. It looked like a firefly in the darkness, </p>
 <p>hovering over me, by my side. In its realm, it was a blob of sheer energy. I was able to </p>
 <p>see its energetic sizzling. It seemed to be conscious of me. Suddenly, it lurched onto me </p>
 <p>and tugged me or prodded me. I did not feel its touch, yet I knew it was touching me. </p>
 <p>That sensation was startling and new; it was as if a part of me that was not there had been </p>
 <p>electrified by that touch; ripples of energy went through it, one after another.</p>
 <p>From that moment on, everything in my dreaming became much more real. I had a very </p>
 <p>difficult time keeping the idea that I was dreaming a dream. To this difficulty. I had to </p>
 <p>add the certainty I had that with its touch the scout had made an energetic connection </p>
 <p>with me. I knew what it wanted me to do the instant it seemed to tug me or shove me.</p>
 <p>The first thing it did was to push me through a huge cavern or opening into the physical </p>
 <p>mass I had been facing. Once I was inside that mass, I realized that the interior was as </p>
 <p>homogeneously porous as the outside but much softer looking, as if the roughness had </p>
 <p>been sanded down. What I was facing was a structure that looked something like the </p>
 <p>enlarged picture of a beehive. There were countless geometric-shaped tunnels going in </p>
 <p>every direction. Some went up or down, or to my left or my right; they were at angles </p>
 <p>with one another, or going up or down on steep or mild inclines.</p>
 <p>The light was very dim, yet everything was perfectly visible. The tunnels seemed to be </p>
 <p>alive and conscious; they sizzled. I stared at them, and the realization that I was seeing hit </p>
 <p>me. Those were tunnels of energy. At the instant of this realization, the voice of the </p>
 <p>dreaming emissary roared inside my ears, so loudly I could not understand what it said.</p>
 <p>"Lower it down," I yelled with unusual impatience and became aware that if I spoke I </p>
 <p>blocked my view of the tunnels and entered into a vacuum where all I could do was hear.</p>
 <p>The emissary modulated its voice and said, "You are inside an inorganic being. Choose a </p>
 <p>tunnel and you can even live in it." The voice stopped for an instant, then added, "That is, </p>
 <p>if you want to do it."</p>
 <p>I could not bring myself to say anything. I was afraid that any statement of mine might be </p>
 <p>construed as the opposite of what I meant.</p>
 <p>"There are endless advantages for you," the emissary's voice continued. "You can live in </p>
 <p>as many tunnels as you want. And each one of them will teach something different. The </p>
 <p>sorcerers of antiquity lived in this manner and learned marvelous things."</p>
 <p>I sensed without any feeling that the scout was pushing me from behind. It appeared to </p>
 <p>want me to move onward. I took the tunnel to my immediate right. As soon as I was in it, </p>
 <p>some thing made me aware that I was not walking on the tunnel; I was hovering in it, </p>
 <p>flying. I was a blob of energy no different from the scout.</p>
 <p>The voice of the emissary sounded inside my ears again. "Yes, you are just a blob of </p>
 <p>energy," it said. Its redundancy brought me an intense relief. "And you are floating inside </p>
 <p>one inorganic being," it went on. "This is the way the scout wants you to move in this </p>
 <p>world. When it touched you, it changed you forever. You are practically one of us now. If </p>
 <p>you want to stay here, just voice your intent." The emissary stopped talking, and the view </p>
 <p>of the tunnel returned to me. But when it spoke again, something had been adjusted; I did </p>
 <p>not lose sight of that world and I still could hear the emissary's voice. "The ancient </p>
 <p>sorcerers learned everything they knew about dreaming by staying here among us," it </p>
 <p>said.</p>
 <p>I was going to ask if they had learned everything they knew by just living inside those </p>
 <p>tunnels, but before I voiced my question the emissary answered it.</p>
 <p>"Yes, they learned everything by just living inside the inorganic beings," it said. "To live </p>
 <p>inside them, all the old sorcerers had to do was say they wanted to, just like all it took for </p>
 <p>you to get here was to voice your intent, loud and clear."</p>
 <p>The scout pushed against me to signal me to continue moving. I hesitated, and it did </p>
 <p>something equivalent to shoving me with such a force that I shot like a bullet through </p>
 <p>endless tunnels. I finally stopped because the scout stopped. We hovered for an instant; </p>
 <p>then we dropped into a vertical tunnel. I did not feel the drastic change of direction. As </p>
 <p>far as my perception was concerned, I was still moving seemingly parallel to the ground.</p>
 <p>We changed directions many times with the same perceptual effect on me. I began to </p>
 <p>formulate a thought about my incapacity to feel that I was moving up or down when I </p>
 <p>heard the emissary's voice. "I think you'll be more comfortable if you crawl rather than </p>
 <p>fly," it said. "You can also move like a spider or a fly, straight up or down or upside </p>
 <p>down."</p>
 <p>Instantaneously, I settled down. It was as if I had been fluffy and suddenly I got some </p>
 <p>weight, which grounded me. I could not feel the tunnel's walls, but the emissary was </p>
 <p>right about my being more comfortable when crawling.</p>
 <p>"In this world you don't have to be pinned down by gravity it said. Of course, I was able </p>
 <p>to realize that myself. "You don't have to breathe either," the voice went on. "And, for </p>
 <p>your convenience alone, you can retain your eyesight and see as you see in your world." </p>
 <p>The emissary seemed to be deciding whether to add more. It coughed, just like a man </p>
 <p>clearing his throat, and said, "The eyesight is never impaired; therefore, a dreamer always </p>
 <p>speaks about his dreaming in terms of what he sees."</p>
 <p>The scout pushed me into a tunnel to my right. It was some how darker than the others. </p>
 <p>To me, at a preposterous level, it seemed cozier than the others, more friendly or even </p>
 <p>known to me. The thought crossed my mind that I was like that tunnel or that the tunnel </p>
 <p>was like me.</p>
 <p>"You two have met before," the emissary's voice said.</p>
 <p>"I beg your pardon," I said. I had understood what it said, but the statement was </p>
 <p>incomprehensible.</p>
 <p>"You two wrestled, and because of that you now carry each other's energy." I thought </p>
 <p>that the emissary's voice carried a touch of malice or even sarcasm.</p>
 <p>"No, it isn't sarcasm," the emissary said. "I am glad that you have relatives here among </p>
 <p>us."</p>
 <p>"What do you mean by relatives?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Shared energy makes kinship," it replied. "Energy is like blood."</p>
 <p>I was unable to say anything else. I clearly felt pangs of fear.</p>
 <p>"Fear is something that is absent in this world," the emissary said. And that was the only </p>
 <p>statement that was not true.</p>
 <p>My dreaming ended there. I was so shocked by the vividness of everything, and by the </p>
 <p>impressive clarity and continuity of the emissary's statements, that I could not wait to tell </p>
 <p>don Juan. It surprised and disturbed me that he did not want to hear my account. He did </p>
 <p>not say so, but I had the impression that he believed all of it had been a product of my </p>
 <p>indulging personality.</p>
 <p>"Why are you behaving like this with me?" I asked. "Are you displeased with me?"</p>
 <p>"No. I am not displeased with you," he said. "The problem is that I can't talk about this </p>
 <p>part of your dreaming. You are completely by yourself in this case. I have said to you that </p>
 <p>inorganic beings are real. You are finding out how real they are. But what you do with </p>
 <p>this finding is your business, yours alone. Someday you'll see the reason for my staying </p>
 <p>away."</p>
 <p>"But isn't there something you can tell me about that dream?" I insisted.</p>
 <p>"What I can say is that it wasn't a dream. It was a journey into the unknown. A necessary </p>
 <p>journey, I may add, and an ultrapersonal one."</p>
 <p>He changed the subject then and began to talk about other aspects of his teachings.</p>
 <p>From that day on, in spite of my fear and don Juan's reluctance to advise me, I became a </p>
 <p>regular dream traveler to that spongy world. I discovered right away that the greater my </p>
 <p>capacity to observe the details of my dreams, the greater my facility to isolate the scouts. </p>
 <p>If I chose to acknowledge the scouts as foreign energy, they remained within my </p>
 <p>perceptual field for a while. Now, if I chose to turn the scouts into quasi known objects, </p>
 <p>they stayed even longer, changing shapes erratically. But if I followed them, by revealing </p>
 <p>out loud my intent to go with them, the scouts veritably transported my dreaming </p>
 <p>attention to a world beyond what I can normally imagine.</p>
 <p>Don Juan had said that inorganic beings are always poised to teach. But he had not told </p>
 <p>me that dreaming is what they are poised to teach. He had stated that the dreaming </p>
 <p>emissary, since it is a voice, is the perfect bridge between that world and ours. I found out </p>
 <p>that the dreaming emissary was not only a teacher's voice but the voice of a most subtle </p>
 <p>salesman. It repeated on and on, at the proper time and occasion, the advantages of its </p>
 <p>world. Yet it also taught me invaluable things about dreaming. Listening to what it said, I </p>
 <p>understood the old sorcerers' preference for concrete practices.</p>
 <p>"For perfect dreaming, the first thing you have to do is shut off your internal dialogue," it </p>
 <p>said to me one time, "For best results in shutting it off, put between your fingers some </p>
 <p>two- or three-inch-long quartz crystals or a couple of smooth, thin river pebbles. Bend </p>
 <p>your fingers slightly, and press the crystals or pebbles with them."</p>
 <p>The emissary said that metal pins, if they were the size and width of one's fingers, were </p>
 <p>equally effective. The procedure consisted of pressing at least three thin items between </p>
 <p>the fingers of each hand and creating, an almost painful pressure m the hands. This </p>
 <p>pressure had the strange property of shutting off the internal dialogue. The emissary's </p>
 <p>expressed preference was for quartz crystals; it said that they gave the best results, </p>
 <p>although with practice anything was suitable.</p>
 <p>"Falling asleep at a moment of total silence guarantees a perfect entrance into dreaming," </p>
 <p>said the emissary's voice, "and it also guarantees the enhancing of one's dreaming </p>
 <p>attention."</p>
 <p>"Dreamers should wear a gold ring," said the emissary to me another time, "preferably </p>
 <p>fitted a bit tight."</p>
 <p>The emissary's explanation was that such a ring serves as a bridge for surfacing from </p>
 <p>dreaming back into the daily world or for sinking from our daily awareness into the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings' realm.</p>
 <p>"How does this bridge work?" I asked. I had not understood what was involved.</p>
 <p>"The contact of the fingers on the ring lays the bridge down," the emissary said. "If a </p>
 <p>dreamer comes into my world wearing a ring, that ring attracts the energy of my world </p>
 <p>and keeps it; and when it's needed, that energy transports the dreamer back to this world, </p>
 <p>by the ring releasing it into the dreamer's fingers.</p>
 <p>"The pressure of that ring around a finger serves equally well to ensure a dreamer's </p>
 <p>return to his world. It gives him a constant, familiar sense on his finger."</p>
 <p>During another dreaming session, the emissary said that our skin is the perfect organ for </p>
 <p>transposing energy waves from the mode of the daily world to the mode of the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings and vice versa. It recommended that I keep my skin cool and free from pigments </p>
 <p>or oils. It also recommended that dreamers wear a tight belt or headband or necklace to </p>
 <p>create a pressure point that serves as a skin center of energy exchange. The emissary </p>
 <p>explained that the skin automatically screens energy, and that what we need to do to </p>
 <p>make the skin not only screen but exchange energy from one mode to the other is to </p>
 <p>express our intent out loud, in dreaming.</p>
 <p>One day the emissary's voice gave me a fabulous bonus. It said that, in order to ensure </p>
 <p>the keenness and accuracy of our dreaming attention, we must bring it from behind the </p>
 <p>roof of the mouth, where an enormous reservoir of attention is located in all human </p>
 <p>beings. The emissary's specific directions were to practice and learn the discipline and </p>
 <p>control necessary to press the tip of the tongue on the roof of the mouth while dreaming. </p>
 <p>This task is as difficult and consuming, the emissary said, as finding one's hands in a </p>
 <p>dream. But, once it is accomplished, this task gives the most astounding results in terms </p>
 <p>of controlling the dreaming attention.</p>
 <p>I received a profusion of instructions on every conceivable subject, instructions that I </p>
 <p>promptly forgot if they were not endlessly repeated to me. I sought don Juan's advice on </p>
 <p>how to resolve this problem of forgetting.</p>
 <p>His comment was as brief as I had expected. "Focus only on what the emissary tells you </p>
 <p>about dreaming," he said.</p>
 <p>Whatever the emissary's voice repeated enough times, I grasped with tremendous interest </p>
 <p>and fervor. Faithful to don Juan's recommendation, I only followed its guidance when it </p>
 <p>referred to dreaming and I personally corroborated the value of its instruction. The most </p>
 <p>vital piece of information for me was that the dreaming attention comes from behind the </p>
 <p>roof of the mouth. It took a great deal of effort on my part to feel in dreaming that I was </p>
 <p>pressing the roof of my mouth with the tip of my tongue. Once I accomplished this, my </p>
 <p>dreaming attention took on a life of its own and became, I may say, keener than my </p>
 <p>normal attention to the daily world.</p>
 <p>It did not take much for me to deduce how deep must have been the involvement of the </p>
 <p>old sorcerers with the inorganic beings. Don Juan's commentaries and warnings about the </p>
 <p>danger of such an involvement became more vital than ever. I tried my best to live up to </p>
 <p>his standards of self-examination with no indulgence. Thus, the emissary's voice and </p>
 <p>what it said became a superchallenge for me. I had to avoid, at all cost, succumbing to the </p>
 <p>temptation of the emissary's promise of knowledge, and I had to do this all by myself </p>
 <p>since don Juan continued to refuse to listen to my accounts.</p>
 <p>"You must give me at least a hint about what I should do," I insisted on one occasion </p>
 <p>when I was bold enough to ask him.</p>
 <p>"I can't," he said with finality "and don't ask again. I've told you, in this instance, </p>
 <p>dreamers have to be left alone."</p>
 <p>"But you don't even know what I want to ask you."</p>
 <p>"Oh yes I do. You want me to tell you that it is all right to live in one of those tunnels, if </p>
 <p>for no other reason than just to know what the emissary's voice is talking about."</p>
 <p>I admitted that this was exactly my dilemma. If nothing else, I wanted to know what was </p>
 <p>implied in the statement that one can live inside those tunnels.</p>
 <p>"I went through the same turmoil myself," don Juan went on, "and no one could help me, </p>
 <p>because this is a superpersonal and final decision, a final decision made the instant you </p>
 <p>voice your desire to live in that world. In order to get you to voice that desire, the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings are going to cater to your most secret wishes."</p>
 <p>"This is really diabolical, don Juan."</p>
 <p>"You can say that again. But not just because of what you are thinking. For you, the </p>
 <p>diabolical part is the temptation to give in, especially when such great rewards are at </p>
 <p>stake. For me, the diabolical nature of the inorganic beings' realm is that it might very </p>
 <p>well be the only sanctuary dreamers have in a hostile universe."</p>
 <p>"Is it really a haven for dreamers, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"It definitely is for some dreamers. Not for me. I don't need props or railings. I know </p>
 <p>what I am. I am alone in a hostile universe, and I have learned to say, So be it!"</p>
 <p>That was the end of our exchange. He had not said what I wanted to hear, yet I knew that </p>
 <p>even the desire to know what it was like to live in a tunnel meant almost to choose that </p>
 <p>way of life. I was not interested in such a thing. I made my decision right then to continue </p>
 <p>my dreaming practices without any further implications. I quickly told don Juan about it.</p>
 <p>"Don't say anything," he advised me. "But do understand that if you choose to stay, your </p>
 <p>decision is final. You'll stay there forever."</p>
 <p>It is impossible for me to judge objectively what took place during the countless times I </p>
 <p>dreamt of that world. I can say that it appeared to be a world as real as any dream can be </p>
 <p>real. Or I can say that it appeared to be as real as our daily world is real. Dreaming of that </p>
 <p>world, I became aware of what don Juan had said to me many times: that under the </p>
 <p>influence of dreaming, reality suffers a metamorphosis. I found myself then facing the </p>
 <p>two options which; according to don Juan, are the options faced by all dreamers: either </p>
 <p>we carefully revamp or we completely disregard our system of sensory input </p>
 <p>interpretation.</p>
 <p>For don Juan, to revamp our interpretation system meant to intend its reconditioning. It </p>
 <p>meant that one deliberately and carefully attempts to enlarge its capabilities. By living in </p>
 <p>accordance with the sorcerers' way, dreamers save and store the necessary energy to </p>
 <p>suspend judgment and thus facilitate that intended revamping. He explained that if we </p>
 <p>choose to recondition our interpretation system, reality becomes fluid, and the scope of </p>
 <p>what can be real is enhanced without endangering the integrity of reality. Dreaming, then, </p>
 <p>indeed opens the door into other aspects of what is real.</p>
 <p>If we choose to disregard our system, the scope of what can be perceived without </p>
 <p>interpretation grows inordinately. The expansion of our perception is so gigantic that we </p>
 <p>are left with very few tools for sensory interpretation and, thus, a sense of an infinite </p>
 <p>realness that is unreal or an infinite unrealness that could very well be real but is not.</p>
 <p>For me, the only acceptable option was reconstructing and enlarging my interpretation </p>
 <p>system. In dreaming the inorganic beings' realm, I was faced with the consistence of that </p>
 <p>world from dream to dream, from isolating the scouts through listening to the dreaming </p>
 <p>emissary's voice to going through tunnels. I went through them without feeling anything, </p>
 <p>yet being aware that space and time were constant, although not in terms discernible by </p>
 <p>rationality under normal conditions. However, by noticing the difference or the absence </p>
 <p>or profusion of detail in each tunnel, or by noticing the sense of distance between tunnels, </p>
 <p>or by noticing the apparent length or width of each tunnel in which I traveled, I arrived at </p>
 <p>a sense of objective observation.</p>
 <p>The area where this reconstruction of my interpretation system had the most dramatic </p>
 <p>effect was the knowledge of how I related to the world of the inorganic beings. In that </p>
 <p>world, which was real to me, I was a blob of energy Thus, I could whiz in the tunnels, </p>
 <p>like a fast-moving light, or I could crawl on their walls, like an insect. If I flew, a voice </p>
 <p>told me not arbitrary but consistent information about details on the walls on which I had </p>
 <p>focused my dreaming attention. Those details were intricate protuberances, like the </p>
 <p>Braille system of writing. When I crawled on the walls, I could see the same details with </p>
 <p>greater accuracy and hear the voice giving me more complex descriptions.</p>
 <p>The unavoidable consequence for me was the development of a dual stand. On the one </p>
 <p>hand, I knew I was dreaming a dream; on the other, I knew I was involved in a pragmatic </p>
 <p>journey, as real as any journey in the world. This bona fide split was a corroboration of </p>
 <p>what don Juan had said: that the existence of inorganic beings is the foremost assailant of </p>
 <p>our ration alit</p>
 <p>Only after I had really suspended judgment did I get any relief. At one moment, when the </p>
 <p>tension of my untenable position-seriously believing in the attestable existence of </p>
 <p>inorganic beings, while seriously believing that it was only a dream-was about to </p>
 <p>destroy me, something in my attitude changed drastically, but without any solicitation on </p>
 <p>my part.</p>
 <p>Don Juan maintained that my energy level, which had been steadily growing, one day </p>
 <p>reached a threshold that allowed me to disregard assumptions and prejudgments about the </p>
 <p>nature of man, reality, and perception. That day I became enamored with knowledge, </p>
 <p>regardless of logic or functional value, and, above all, regardless of personal </p>
 <p>convenience.</p>
 <p>When my objective inquiry into the subject of inorganic beings no longer mattered to me, </p>
 <p>don Juan himself brought up the subject of my dream journey into that world. He said, "1 </p>
 <p>don't think you are aware of the regularity of your meetings with inorganic beings."</p>
 <p>He was right. I had never bothered to think about it. I commented on the oddity of my </p>
 <p>oversight.</p>
 <p>"It isn't an oversight," he said. "It's the nature of that realm to foster secretiveness. </p>
 <p>Inorganic beings veil themselves in mystery, darkness. Think about their world: </p>
 <p>stationary, fixed to draw us like moths to a light or a fire.</p>
 <p>"There is something the emissary hasn't dared to tell you so far: that the inorganic beings </p>
 <p>are after our awareness or the awareness of any being that falls into their nets. They'll </p>
 <p>give us knowledge, but they'll extract a payment: our total being."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that the inorganic beings are like fishermen?"</p>
 <p>"Exactly. At one moment, the emissary will show you men who got caught in there or </p>
 <p>other beings that are not human that also got caught in there."</p>
 <p>Revulsion and fear should have been my response. Don Juan's revelations affected me </p>
 <p>deeply, but in the sense of creating uncontainable curiosity. I was nearly panting.</p>
 <p>"Inorganic beings can't force anyone to stay with them," don Juan went on. "To live in </p>
 <p>their world is a voluntary affair Yet they are capable of imprisoning any one of us by </p>
 <p>catering to our desires, by pampering and indulging us. Beware of awareness that is </p>
 <p>immobile. Awareness like that has to seek movement, and it does this, as I've told you, </p>
 <p>by creating projections, phantasmagorical projections at times."</p>
 <p>I asked don Juan to explain what "phantasmagorical projections" meant. He said that </p>
 <p>inorganic beings hook onto dreamers' innermost feelings and play them mercilessly. </p>
 <p>They create phantoms to please dreamers or frighten them. He reminded me that I had </p>
 <p>wrestled with one of those phantoms. He explained that inorganic beings are superb </p>
 <p>projectionists, who delight in projecting themselves like pictures on the wall.</p>
 <p>"The old sorcerers were brought down by their inane trust in those projections," he </p>
 <p>continued. "The old sorcerers believed their allies had power. They overlooked the fact </p>
 <p>their allies were tenuous energy projected through worlds, like in a cosmic movie."</p>
 <p>"You are contradicting yourself, don Juan. You yourself said that the inorganic beings are </p>
 <p>real. Now you tell me that they are mere pictures."</p>
 <p>"I meant to say that the inorganic beings, in our world, are like moving pictures projected </p>
 <p>on a screen; and I may even add that they are like moving pictures of rarefied energy </p>
 <p>projected through the boundaries of two worlds."</p>
 <p>"But what about inorganic beings in their world? Are they also like moving pictures?"</p>
 <p>"Not a chance. That world is as real as our world. The old sorcerers portrayed the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings' world as a blob of caverns and pores floating in some dark space. And </p>
 <p>they portrayed the inorganic beings as hollow canes bound together, like the cells of our </p>
 <p>bodies. The old sorcerers called that immense bundle the labyrinth of penumbra."</p>
 <p>"Then every dreamer sees that world in the same terms, right?"</p>
 <p>"Of course. Every dreamer sees it as it is. Do you think you are unique?"</p>
 <p>I confessed that something in that world had been giving me all along the sensation I was </p>
 <p>unique. What created this most pleasant and clear feeling of being exclusive was not the </p>
 <p>voice of the dreaming emissary, or anything I could consciously think about.</p>
 <p>"That's exactly what floored the old sorcerers," don Juan said. "The inorganic beings did </p>
 <p>to them what they are doing to you now; they created for them the sense of being unique, </p>
 <p>exclusive; plus a more pernicious sense yet: the sense of having power. Power and </p>
 <p>uniqueness are unbeatable as corrupting forces. Watch out!"</p>
 <p>"How did you avoid that danger yourself, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"I went to that world a few times, and then I never went back."</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that in the opinion of sorcerers, the universe is predatorial, and </p>
 <p>sorcerers more than anyone else have to take this into account in their daily sorcery </p>
 <p>activities. His idea was that consciousness is intrinsically compelled to grow, and the </p>
 <p>only way it can grow is through strife, through life-or-death confrontations.</p>
 <p>"The awareness of sorcerers grows when they do dreaming," he went on. "And the </p>
 <p>moment it grows, something out there acknowledges its growth, recognizes it and makes </p>
 <p>a bid for it. The inorganic beings are the bidders for that new, enhanced awareness. </p>
 <p>Dreamers have to be forever on their toes. They are prey the moment they venture out in </p>
 <p>that predatorial universe."</p>
 <p>"What do you suggest I do to be safe, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Be on your toes every second! Don't let anything or any body decide for you. Go to the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings' world only when you want to go."</p>
 <p>"Honestly, don Juan, I wouldn't know how to do that. Once I isolate a scout, a </p>
 <p>tremendous pull is exerted on me to go. I don't have a chance in hell to change my </p>
 <p>mind."</p>
 <p>"Come on! Who do you think you're kidding? You can definitely stop it. You haven't </p>
 <p>tried to, that's all."</p>
 <p>I earnestly insisted that it was impossible for me to stop. He did not pursue the subject </p>
 <p>any longer, and I was thankful for that. A disturbing feeling of guilt had begun to gnaw at </p>
 <p>me. For some unknown reason, the thought of consciously stopping the pull of the scouts </p>
 <p>had never occurred to me.</p>
 <p>As usual, don Juan was correct. I found out that I could change the course of my </p>
 <p>dreaming by intending that course. After all, I did intend for the scouts to transport me to </p>
 <p>their world. It was feasible that if I deliberately intended the opposite, my dreaming </p>
 <p>would follow the opposite course.</p>
 <p>With practice, my capacity to intend my journeys into the inorganic beings' realm </p>
 <p>became extraordinarily keen. An increased capacity to intend brought forth an increased </p>
 <p>control over my dreaming attention. This additional control made me more daring. I felt </p>
 <p>that I could journey with impunity, because I could stop the journey any time I wanted to.</p>
 <p>"Your confidence is very scary" was don Juan's comment when I told him, at his request, </p>
 <p>about the new aspect of my control over my dreaming attention.</p>
 <p>"Why should it be scary?" I asked. I was truly convinced of the practical value of what I </p>
 <p>had found out.</p>
 <p>"Because yours is the confidence of a fool," he said. "I am going to tell you a sorcerers' </p>
 <p>story that is apropos. I didn't witness it myself, but my teacher's teacher, the nagual </p>
 <p>Elias, did."</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that the nagual Elias and the love of his life, a sorceress named Amalia, </p>
 <p>were lost, in their youth, in the inorganic beings' world.</p>
 <p>I had never heard don Juan talk about sorcerers being the love of anybody's life. His </p>
 <p>statement startled me. I asked him about this inconsistency.</p>
 <p>"It's not an inconsistency. I have simply refrained all along from telling you stories of </p>
 <p>sorcerers' affection," he said. "You've been so oversaturated with love all your life that I </p>
 <p>wanted to give you a break.</p>
 <p>"Well, the nagual Elias and the love of his life, the witch Amalia, got lost in the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings' world," don Juan went on. "They went there not in dreaming but with their </p>
 <p>physical bodies."</p>
 <p>"How did that happen, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Their teacher, the nagual Rosendo, was very close in temperament and practice to the </p>
 <p>old sorcerers. He intended to help Elias and Amalia, but instead he pushed them across </p>
 <p>some deadly boundaries. The nagual Rosendo didn't have that crossing in mind. What he </p>
 <p>wanted to do was to put his two disciples into the second attention, but what he got as a </p>
 <p>result was their disappearance."</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that he was not going to go into the details of that long and complicated </p>
 <p>story. He was only going to tell me how they became lost in that world. He stated that the </p>
 <p>nagual Rosendo's miscalculation was to assume that the inorganic beings are not, in the </p>
 <p>slightest, interested in women. His reasoning was correct and was guided by the </p>
 <p>sorcerers' knowledge that the universe is markedly female and that maleness, being an </p>
 <p>offshoot of femaleness, is almost scarce, thus, coveted.</p>
 <p>Don Juan made a digression and commented that perhaps that scarcity of males is the </p>
 <p>reason for men's unwarranted dominion on our planet. I wanted to remain on that topic, </p>
 <p>but he went ahead with his story He said that the nagual Rosendo's plan was to give </p>
 <p>instruction to Elias and Amalia exclusively in the second attention. And to that effect, he </p>
 <p>followed the old sorcerers' prescribed technique. He engaged a scout, in dreaming, and </p>
 <p>commanded it to transport his disciples into the second attention by displacing their </p>
 <p>assemblage points on the proper position.</p>
 <p>Theoretically, a powerful scout could displace their assemblage points on the proper </p>
 <p>position with no effort at all. What the nagual Rosendo did not take into consideration </p>
 <p>was the trickery of the inorganic beings. The scout did displace the assemblage points of </p>
 <p>his disciples, but it displaced them on a position from which it was easy to transport them </p>
 <p>bodily into the realm of the inorganic beings.</p>
 <p>"Is this possible, to be transported bodily?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"It is possible," he assured me. "We are energy that is kept in a specific shape and </p>
 <p>position by the fixation of the assemblage point on one location. If that location is </p>
 <p>changed, the shape and position of that energy will change accordingly. All the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings have to do is to place our assemblage point on the right location, and off we go, </p>
 <p>like a bullet, shoes, hat, and all."</p>
 <p>"Can this happen to any one of us, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Most certainly. Especially if our sum total of energy is right. Obviously, the sum total of </p>
 <p>the combined energies of Elias and Amalia was something the inorganic beings couldn't </p>
 <p>overlook. It is absurd to trust the inorganic beings. They have their own rhythm and it </p>
 <p>isn't human."</p>
 <p>I asked don Juan what exactly the nagual Rosendo did to send his disciples to that world. </p>
 <p>knew it was stupid of me to ask, knowing that he was going to ignore my question. My </p>
 <p>surprise was genuine when he began to tell me.</p>
 <p>"The steps are simplicity itself," he said. "He put his disciples inside a very small, closed </p>
 <p>space, something like a closet. Then he went into dreaming, called a scout from the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings' realm by voicing his intent to get one, then voiced his intent to offer his </p>
 <p>disciples to the scout.</p>
 <p>"The scout, naturally, accepted the gift and took them away, at an unguarded moment, </p>
 <p>when they were making love inside that closet. When the nagual opened the closet, they </p>
 <p>were no longer there."</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that making gifts of their disciples to the inorganic beings was </p>
 <p>precisely what the old sorcerers used to do. The nagual Rosendo did not mean to do that, </p>
 <p>but he got swayed by the absurd belief that the inorganic beings were under his control.</p>
 <p>"Sorcerers' maneuvers are deadly," don Juan went on. "I beseech you to be </p>
 <p>extraordinarily aware. Don't get involved in having some idiotic confidence in yourself."</p>
 <p>"What finally happened to the nagual Elias and Amalia?" I asked. </p>
 <p>"The nagual Rosendo had to go bodily into that world and look for them," he replied.</p>
 <p>"Did he find them?"</p>
 <p>"He did, after untold struggles. However, he could not totally bring them out. So the two </p>
 <p>young people were always semiprisoners of that realm."</p>
 <p>"Did you know them, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Of course I knew them, and I assure you, they were very strange."</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 6</p>
 <p>THE SHADOWS' WORLD</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>You must be extremely careful, for you are about to fall prey to the inorganic beings," </p>
 <p>don Juan said to me, quite unexpectedly, after we had been talking about something </p>
 <p>totally unrelated to dreaming.</p>
 <p>His statement caught me by surprise. As usual, I attempted to defend myself. "You don't </p>
 <p>have to warn me. I'm very careful," I assured him.</p>
 <p>"The inorganic beings are plotting," he said. "I sense that, and I can't console myself by </p>
 <p>saying that they set traps at the beginning and, in this manner, undesirable dreamers are </p>
 <p>effectively and permanently screened out."</p>
 <p>The tone of his voice was so urgent that I immediately had to reassure him I was not </p>
 <p>going to fall into any trap.</p>
 <p>"You must seriously consider that the inorganic beings have astounding means at their </p>
 <p>disposal," he went on. "Their awareness is superb. In comparison, we are children, </p>
 <p>children with a lot of energy, which the inorganic beings covet."</p>
 <p>I wanted to tell him that, on an abstract level, I had understood his point and his concern, </p>
 <p>but, on a concrete plane, I saw no reason for his warning, because I was in control of my </p>
 <p>dreaming practices.</p>
 <p>A few minutes of uneasy silence followed before don Juan spoke again. He changed the </p>
 <p>subject and said that he had to bring to my attention a very important issue of his </p>
 <p>dreaming instruction, an issue that had, so far, bypassed my awareness.</p>
 <p>"You already understand that the gates of dreaming are specific obstacles," he said, "but </p>
 <p>you haven't understood yet that whatever is given as the exercise to reach and cross a </p>
 <p>gate is not really what that gate is all about."</p>
 <p>"This is not clear to me at all, don Juan."</p>
 <p>"I mean that it's not true to say, for example, that the second gate is reached and crossed </p>
 <p>when a dreamer learns to wake up in another dream, or when a dreamer learns to change </p>
 <p>dreams without waking up in the world of daily life."</p>
 <p>"Why isn't it true, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Because the second gate of dreaming is reached and crossed only when a dreamer learns </p>
 <p>to isolate and follow the foreign energy scouts."</p>
 <p>"Why then is the idea of changing dreams given at all?"</p>
 <p>"Waking up in another dream or changing dreams is the drill devised by the old sorcerers </p>
 <p>to exercise a dreamer's capacity to isolate and follow a scout."</p>
 <p>Don Juan stated that following a scout is a high accomplishment and that when dreamers </p>
 <p>are able to perform it, the second gate is flung open and the universe that exists behind it </p>
 <p>becomes accessible to them. He stressed that this universe is there all the time but that we </p>
 <p>cannot go into it because we lack energetic prowess and that, in essence, the second gate </p>
 <p>of dreaming is the door into the inorganic beings' world, and dreaming is the key that </p>
 <p>opens that door.</p>
 <p>"Can a dreamer isolate a scout directly, without having to go through the drill of </p>
 <p>changing dreams?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"No, not at all," he said. "The drill is essential. The question here is whether this is the </p>
 <p>only drill that exists. Or can a dreamer follow another drill?"</p>
 <p>Don Juan looked at me quizzically. It seemed that he actually expected me to answer the </p>
 <p>question. "It's too difficult to come up with a drill as complete as the one the old </p>
 <p>sorcerers devised," I said, without knowing why but with irrefutable authority.</p>
 <p>Don Juan admitted that I was absolutely right and said that the old sorcerers had devised </p>
 <p>a series of perfect drills to go through the gates of dreaming into the specific worlds that </p>
 <p>exist behind every gate. He reiterated that dreaming, being the old sorcerers' invention, </p>
 <p>has to be played by their rules. He described the rule of the second gate in terms of a </p>
 <p>series of three steps: one, through practicing the drill of changing dreams, dreamers find </p>
 <p>out about the scouts; two, by following the scouts, they enter into another veritable </p>
 <p>universe; and three, in that universe, by means of their actions, dreamers find out, on their </p>
 <p>own, the governing laws and regulations of that universe.</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that in my dealings with the inorganic beings, I had followed the rule so </p>
 <p>well that he feared devastating consequences. He thought that the unavoidable reaction </p>
 <p>on the part of the inorganic beings was going to be an attempt to keep me in their world.</p>
 <p>"Don't you think that you are exaggerating, don Juan?" I asked. I could not believe that </p>
 <p>the picture was as bleak as he was painting it.</p>
 <p>"I am not exaggerating at all," he said, in a dry, serious tone.</p>
 <p>"You'll see. The inorganic beings don't let anyone go, not without a real fight."</p>
 <p>"But what makes you think they want me?"</p>
 <p>"They've already shown you too many things. Do you really believe that they are going </p>
 <p>to all this trouble just to entertain themselves?"</p>
 <p>Don Juan laughed at his own remark. I did not find him amusing. A strange fear made me </p>
 <p>ask him whether he thought I should interrupt or even discontinue my dreaming practices.</p>
 <p>"You have to continue your dreaming until you have gone through the universe behind </p>
 <p>the second gate," he said. "I mean that you alone must either accept or reject the lure of </p>
 <p>the inorganic beings. That is why I remain aloof and hardly ever comment on your </p>
 <p>dreaming practices."</p>
 <p>I confessed to him that I had been at a loss to explain why he was so generous in </p>
 <p>elucidating other aspects of his knowledge and so miserly with dreaming.</p>
 <p>"I was forced to teach you dreaming," he said, "only because that is the pattern set out by </p>
 <p>the old sorcerers. The path of dreaming is filled with pitfalls, and to avoid those pitfalls or </p>
 <p>to fall into them is the personal and individual affair of each dreamer, and I may add that </p>
 <p>it is a final affair."</p>
 <p>"Are those pitfalls the result of succumbing to adulation or to promises of power?" I </p>
 <p>asked.</p>
 <p>"Not only succumbing to those, but succumbing to anything offered by the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings. There is no way for sorcerers to accept anything offered by them, beyond a </p>
 <p>certain point."</p>
 <p>"And what is that certain point, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"That point depends on us as individuals. The challenge is for each of us to take only </p>
 <p>what is needed from that world, nothing more. To know what's needed is the virtuosity of </p>
 <p>sorcerers, but to take only what's needed is their highest accomplishment. To fail to </p>
 <p>understand this simple rule is the surest way of plummeting into a pitfall."</p>
 <p>"What happens if you fall, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"If you fall, you pay the price, and the price depends on the circumstances and the depth </p>
 <p>of the fall. But there is really no way of talking about an eventuality of this sort, because </p>
 <p>we are not facing a problem of punishment. Energetic currents are at stake here, energetic </p>
 <p>currents which create circumstances that are more dreadful than death. Everything in the </p>
 <p>sorcerers' path is a matter of life or death, but in the path of dreaming this matter is </p>
 <p>enhanced a hundred fold."</p>
 <p>I reassured don Juan that I always exercised the utmost care in my dreaming practices, </p>
 <p>and that I was extremely disciplined and conscientious.</p>
 <p>"I know that you are," he said. "But I want you to be even more disciplined and handle </p>
 <p>everything related to dreaming with kid gloves. Be, above all, vigilant. I can't foretell </p>
 <p>where the attack will come from."</p>
 <p>"Are you seeing, as a seer, imminent danger for me, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"I have seen imminent danger for you since the day you walked in that mysterious city, </p>
 <p>the first time I helped you round up your energy body."</p>
 <p>"But do you know specifically what I should do and what I should avoid?"</p>
 <p>"No, I don't. I only know that the universe behind the second gate is the closest to our </p>
 <p>own, and our own universe is pretty crafty and heartless. So the two can't be that </p>
 <p>different."</p>
 <p>I persisted in asking him to tell me what was in store for me. And he insisted that, as a </p>
 <p>sorcerer, he sensed a state of general danger but that he could not be more specific.</p>
 <p>"The universe of the inorganic beings is always ready to strike," he went on. "But so is </p>
 <p>our own universe. That's why you have to go into their realm exactly as if you were </p>
 <p>venturing into a war zone."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that dreamers always have to be afraid of that world?"</p>
 <p>"No. I don't mean that. Once a dreamer goes through the universe behind the second </p>
 <p>gate, or once a dreamer refuses to consider it as a viable option, there are no more </p>
 <p>headaches."</p>
 <p>Don Juan stated that only then are dreamers free to continue. I was not sure what he </p>
 <p>meant; he explained that the universe behind the second gate is so powerful and </p>
 <p>aggressive that it serves as a natural screen or a testing ground where dreamers are </p>
 <p>probed for their weaknesses. If they survive the tests, they can proceed to the next gate; if </p>
 <p>they do not, they remain forever trapped in that universe.</p>
 <p>I was left choking with anxiety but, in spite of my coaxing, that was all he said. When I </p>
 <p>went home, I continued my journeys to the inorganic beings' realm, exerting great care. </p>
 <p>My carefulness seemed only to increase my sense of enjoying those journeys. I got to the </p>
 <p>point that the mere contemplation of the inorganic beings' world was enough to create an </p>
 <p>exultation impossible to describe. I feared that my delight was going to end sooner or </p>
 <p>later, but it was not so. Something unexpected made it even more intense.</p>
 <p>On one occasion, a scout guided me very roughly through countless tunnels, as if </p>
 <p>searching for something, or as if it were trying to draw all my energy out and exhaust me. </p>
 <p>By the time it finally stopped, I felt as if I had run a marathon. I seemed to be at the edge </p>
 <p>of that world. There were no more tunnels, only blackness all around me. Then </p>
 <p>something lit up the area right in front of me; there, light shone from an indirect source. It </p>
 <p>was a subdued light that rendered everything diffusely gray or brownish. When I became </p>
 <p>used to the light, I vaguely distinguished some dark, moving shapes. After a while, it </p>
 <p>seemed to me that focusing my dreaming attention on those moving shapes made them </p>
 <p>substantial. I noticed that there were three types: some of them were round, like balls; </p>
 <p>others were like bells; and others yet like gigantic, undulating candle flames. All of them </p>
 <p>were basically round and the same size. I judged that they were three to four feet in </p>
 <p>diameter. There were hundreds, perhaps even thousands of them.</p>
 <p>I knew that I was having a strange, sophisticated vision, yet those shapes were so real that </p>
 <p>I found myself reacting with genuine queasiness. I got the nauseating feeling of being </p>
 <p>over a nest of giant, round, brown and grayish bugs. I felt somehow safe, though, </p>
 <p>hovering above them. I discarded all these considerations, however, the moment I </p>
 <p>realized that it was idiotic of me to feel safe or ill at ease, as if my dream were a real-life </p>
 <p>situation. However, as I observed those buglike shapes squirm, I became very disturbed </p>
 <p>at the idea that they were about to touch me.</p>
 <p>"We are the mobile unit of our world," the emissary's voice said, all of a sudden. "Don't </p>
 <p>be afraid. We are energy, and, for sure, we're not intending to touch you. It would be </p>
 <p>impossible anyway. We are separated by real boundaries."</p>
 <p>After a long pause, the voice added, "We want you to join us. Come down to where we </p>
 <p>are. And don't be ill at ease. You are not ill at ease with the scouts and certainly not with </p>
 <p>me. The scouts and I are just like the others. I am bell-shaped, and scouts are like candle </p>
 <p>flames."</p>
 <p>That last statement was definitely a cue of sorts for my energy body. On hearing it, my </p>
 <p>queasiness and fear vanished. I descended to their level, and the balls and bells and </p>
 <p>candle flames surrounded me. They came so close to me that they would have touched </p>
 <p>me had I had a physical body. Instead, we went through one another, like encapsulated air </p>
 <p>puffs.</p>
 <p>I had, at that point, an unbelievable sensation. Although I did not feel anything with or in </p>
 <p>my energy body, I was feeling and recording the most unusual tickling somewhere else; </p>
 <p>soft, airlike things were definitely going through me, but not right there. The sensation </p>
 <p>was vague and fast and did not give me time to catch it fully. Instead of focusing my </p>
 <p>dreaming attention on it, I became entirely absorbed in watching those oversized bugs of </p>
 <p>energy</p>
 <p>At the level where we were, it seemed to me that there was a commonality between the </p>
 <p>shadow entities and myself: size.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was because I judged them to be the same size as my energy body that I felt </p>
 <p>almost cozy with them. On examining them, I concluded that I did not mind them at all. </p>
 <p>They were impersonal, cold, detached, and I liked that immensely. I wondered for an </p>
 <p>instant whether my disliking them one minute and liking them the next was a natural </p>
 <p>consequence of dreaming or a product of some energetic influence those entities were </p>
 <p>exerting on me.</p>
 <p>"They are most likable," I said to the emissary, at the very moment I was overpowered by </p>
 <p>a wave of profound friendship or even affection for them.</p>
 <p>No sooner had I spoken my mind than the dark shapes scurried away, like bulky guinea </p>
 <p>pigs, leaving me alone in semi darkness.</p>
 <p>"You projected too much feeling and scared them off," the emissary's voice said. </p>
 <p>"Feeling is too hard for them, and for me for that matter." The emissary actually laughed </p>
 <p>shyly.</p>
 <p>My dreaming session ended there. On awakening, my first reaction was to pack my bag </p>
 <p>to go to Mexico and see don Juan. However, an unexpected development in my personal </p>
 <p>life made it impossible for me to travel, in spite of my frantic preparations to leave. The </p>
 <p>anxiety resulting from this setback interrupted my dreaming practices altogether. I did not </p>
 <p>engage my conscious volition to stop them; I had unwittingly put so much emphasis on </p>
 <p>this specific dream that I simply knew if I could not get to don Juan there was no point in </p>
 <p>continuing dreaming.</p>
 <p>After an interruption that lasted over half a year, I became more and more mystified by </p>
 <p>what had happened. I had no idea that my feelings alone were going to stop my practices. </p>
 <p>I wondered then if the desire would be sufficient to reinstate it. It was! Once I had </p>
 <p>formulated the thought of reentering dreaming, my practices continued as if they had </p>
 <p>never been interrupted. The scout picked up where we had left off and took me directly to </p>
 <p>the vision I'd had during my last session.</p>
 <p>"This is the shadows' world," the emissary's voice said as soon as I was there. "But, even </p>
 <p>though we are shadows, we shed light. Not only are we mobile but we are the light in the </p>
 <p>tunnels. We are another kind of inorganic being that exists here. There are three kinds: </p>
 <p>one is like an immobile tunnel, the other is like a mobile shadow. We are the mobile </p>
 <p>shadows. The tunnels give us their energy and we do their bidding."</p>
 <p>The emissary stopped talking. I felt it was daring me to ask about the third kind of </p>
 <p>inorganic being. I also felt that if I did not ask, the emissary would not tell me.</p>
 <p>"What's the third kind of inorganic being?" I said.</p>
 <p>The emissary coughed and chuckled. To me, it sounded like it relished being asked. "Oh, </p>
 <p>that's our most mysterious feature," it said. "The third kind is revealed to our visitors </p>
 <p>only when they choose to stay with us."</p>
 <p>"Why is that so?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Because it takes a great deal of energy to see them," the emissary answered. "And we </p>
 <p>would have to provide that energy"</p>
 <p>I knew that the emissary was telling me the truth. I also knew that a horrendous danger </p>
 <p>was lurking. Yet I was driven by a curiosity without limits. I wanted to see that third </p>
 <p>kind.</p>
 <p>The emissary seemed to be aware of my mood. "Would you like to see them?" it asked </p>
 <p>casually.</p>
 <p>"Most certainly," I said.</p>
 <p>"All you have to do is to say out loud that you want to stay with us," the emissary said </p>
 <p>with a nonchalant intonation.</p>
 <p>"But if I say that, I have to stay, right?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Naturally," the emissary said in a tone of ultimate conviction. "Everything you say out </p>
 <p>loud in this world is for keeps."</p>
 <p>I could not help thinking that, if the emissary had wanted to trick me into staying, all it </p>
 <p>had to do was lie to me. I would not have known the difference.</p>
 <p>"I cannot lie to you, because a lie doesn't exist," the emissary said, intruding into my </p>
 <p>thoughts. "I can tell you only about what exists. In my world, only intent exists; a lie has </p>
 <p>no intent behind it; therefore, it has no existence."</p>
 <p>I wanted to argue that there is intent even behind lies, but before I could voice my </p>
 <p>argument, the emissary said that behind lies there is intention but that intention is not </p>
 <p>intent.</p>
 <p>I could not keep my dreaming attention focused on the argument the emissary was </p>
 <p>posing. It went to the shadow beings. Suddenly, I noticed that they had the appearance of </p>
 <p>a herd of strange, childlike animals. The emissary's voice warned me to hold my </p>
 <p>emotions in check, for sudden bursts of feelings had the capacity to make them disperse, </p>
 <p>like a flock of birds.</p>
 <p>"What do you want me to do?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Come down to our side and try to push or pull us," the emissary's voice urged me. "The </p>
 <p>quicker you learn to do that, the quicker you'll be able to move things around in your </p>
 <p>world by merely looking at them."</p>
 <p>My merchant's mind went berserk with anticipation. I was instantly among them, </p>
 <p>desperately trying to push them or pull them. After a while, I thoroughly exhausted my </p>
 <p>energy I had then the impression that I had been trying to do something equivalent to </p>
 <p>lifting a house with the strength of my teeth.</p>
 <p>Another impression I had was that the more I exerted myself, the greater the number of </p>
 <p>shadows. It was as if they were coming from every corner to watch me, or to feed on me. </p>
 <p>The moment I had that thought, the shadows again scurried away.</p>
 <p>"We are not feeding on you," the emissary said. "We all come to feel your energy, very </p>
 <p>much like what you do with sunlight on a cold day."</p>
 <p>The emissary urged me to open up to them by canceling out my suspicious thoughts. I </p>
 <p>heard the voice, and, as I listened to what it was saying, I realized that I was hearing, </p>
 <p>feeling, and thinking exactly as I do in my daily world. I slowly turned to see around me. </p>
 <p>Taking the clarity of my perception as a gauge, I concluded that I was in a real world.</p>
 <p>The emissary's voice sounded in my ears. It said that for me the only difference between </p>
 <p>perceiving my world and perceiving theirs was that perceiving their world started and </p>
 <p>ended in the blink of an eye; perceiving mine did not, because my awareness-together </p>
 <p>with the awareness of an immense number of beings like me, who held my world in place </p>
 <p>with their intent-was fixed on my world. The emissary added that perceiving my world </p>
 <p>started and ended the same way for the inorganic beings, in the blink of an eye, but </p>
 <p>perceiving their world did not, because there were immense numbers of them holding it </p>
 <p>in place with their intent.</p>
 <p>At that instant the scene started to dissolve. I was like a diver, and waking up from that </p>
 <p>world was like swimming up to reach the surface.</p>
 <p>In the following session, the emissary began its dialogue with me by restating that a </p>
 <p>totally coordinated and coactive relationship existed between mobile shadows and </p>
 <p>stationary tunnels. It finished its statement saying, "We can't exist without each other."</p>
 <p>"I understand what you mean," I said.</p>
 <p>There was a touch of scorn in the emissary's voice when it retorted that I could not </p>
 <p>possibly understand what it means to be related in that fashion, which was infinitely more </p>
 <p>than being dependent. I intended to ask the emissary to explain what it meant by that, but </p>
 <p>the next instant I was inside of what I can only describe as the very tissue of the tunnel. I </p>
 <p>saw some grotesquely merged, glandlike protuberances that emitted an opaque light. The </p>
 <p>thought crossed my mind that those were the same protuberances that had given me the </p>
 <p>impression of being like Braille. Considering that they were energy blobs three to four </p>
 <p>feet in diameter, I began to wonder about the actual size of those tunnels.</p>
 <p>"Size here is not like size in your world," the emissary said. "The energy of this world is </p>
 <p>a different kind of energy; its features don't coincide with the features of the energy of </p>
 <p>your world, yet this world is as real as your own."</p>
 <p>The emissary went on to say that it had told me everything about the shadow beings when </p>
 <p>it described and explained the protuberances on the tunnels' walls. I retorted that I had </p>
 <p>heard the explanations but I had not paid attention to them because I believed that they </p>
 <p>did not pertain directly to dreaming.</p>
 <p>"Everything here, in this realm, pertains directly to dreaming," the emissary stated.</p>
 <p>I wanted to think about the reason for my misjudgment, but my mind became blank. My </p>
 <p>dreaming attention was waning. I was having trouble focusing it on the world around me. </p>
 <p>I braced myself for waking up. The emissary started to speak again, and the sound of its </p>
 <p>voice propped me up. My dreaming attention perked up considerably.</p>
 <p>"Dreaming is the vehicle that brings dreamers to this world," the emissary said, "and </p>
 <p>everything sorcerers know about dreaming was taught to them by us. Our world is </p>
 <p>connected to yours by a door called dreams. We know how to go through that door, but </p>
 <p>men don't. They have to learn it."</p>
 <p>The emissary's voice went on explaining what it had already explained to me before.</p>
 <p>"The protuberances on the tunnels' walls are shadow beings," it said. "I am one of them. </p>
 <p>We move inside the tunnels, on their walls, charging ourselves with the energy of the </p>
 <p>tunnels, which is our energy."</p>
 <p>An idle thought crossed my mind: I was really incapable of conceiving a symbiotic </p>
 <p>relationship such as the one I was witnessing.</p>
 <p>"If you would stay among us, you would certainly learn to feel what it is like to be </p>
 <p>connected as we are connected," the emissary said.</p>
 <p>The emissary seemed to be waiting for my reply. I had the feeling that what it really </p>
 <p>wanted was for me to say that I had decided to stay.</p>
 <p>"How many shadow beings are in each tunnel?" I asked to change the mood and </p>
 <p>immediately regretted it because the emissary began to give me a detailed account of the </p>
 <p>numbers and functions of the shadow beings in each tunnel. It said that each tunnel had a </p>
 <p>specific number of dependent entities, which performed specific functions having to do </p>
 <p>with the needs and expectations of the supporting tunnels.</p>
 <p>I did not want the emissary to go into more detail. I reasoned that the less I knew about </p>
 <p>the tunnel and shadow beings the better off I was. The instant I formulated that thought, </p>
 <p>the emissary stopped, and my energy body jerked as if it had been pulled by a cable. The </p>
 <p>next moment, I was fully awake, in my bed.</p>
 <p>From then on, I had no more fears that could have interrupted my practices. Another idea </p>
 <p>had begun to rule me: the idea that I had found unparalleled excitation. I could hardly </p>
 <p>wait every day to start dreaming and have the scout take me to the shadows' world. The </p>
 <p>added attraction was that my visions of the shadows' world became even more true to life </p>
 <p>than before. Judged by the subjective standards of orderly thoughts, orderly visual and </p>
 <p>auditory sensory input, orderly responses on my part, my experiences, for as long as they </p>
 <p>lasted, were as real as any situation in our daily world. Never had I had perceptual </p>
 <p>experiences in which the only difference between my visions and my everyday world was </p>
 <p>the speed with which my visions ended. One instant I was in a strange, real world, and </p>
 <p>the next instant I was in my bed.</p>
 <p>I craved don Juan's commentaries and explanations, but I was still marooned in Los </p>
 <p>Angeles. The more I considered my situation, the greater my anxiety; I even began to </p>
 <p>sense that something in the inorganic beings' realm was brewing at tremendous speed.</p>
 <p>As my anxiety grew, my body entered into a state of profound fright, although my mind </p>
 <p>was ecstatic in the contemplation of the shadows' world. To make things worse, the </p>
 <p>dreaming emissary's voice lapsed into my daily consciousness. One day while I was </p>
 <p>attending a class at the university, I heard the voice say, over and over, that any attempt </p>
 <p>on my part to end my dreaming practices would be deleterious to my total aims. It argued </p>
 <p>that warriors do not shy away from a challenge and that I had no valid rationale for </p>
 <p>discontinuing my practices. I agreed with the emissary. I had no intention of stopping any </p>
 <p>thing, and the voice was merely reaffirming what I felt.</p>
 <p>Not only did the emissary change but a new scout appeared on the scene. On one </p>
 <p>occasion, before I had begun to examine the items of my dream, a scout literally jumped </p>
 <p>in front of me and aggressively captured my dreaming attention. The notable feature of </p>
 <p>this scout was that it did not need to go through any energetic metamorphosis; it was a </p>
 <p>blob of energy from the start. In the blink of an eye, the scout transported me, without my </p>
 <p>having to voice my intent to go with it, to another part of the inorganic beings' realm: the </p>
 <p>world of the saber-toothed tigers.</p>
 <p>I have described in my other works glimpses of those visions. I say glimpses because I </p>
 <p>did not have sufficient energy then to render these perceived worlds comprehensible to </p>
 <p>my linear mind.</p>
 <p>My nightly visions of the saber-toothed tigers occurred regularly for a long time, until </p>
 <p>one night when the aggressive scout that had taken me for the first time to that realm </p>
 <p>suddenly appeared again. Without waiting for my consent, it took me to the tunnels.</p>
 <p>I heard the emissary's voice. It immediately went into the longest and most poignant </p>
 <p>sales pitch I had heard so far. It told me about the extraordinary advantages of the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings' world. It spoke of acquiring knowledge that would definitely stagger </p>
 <p>the mind and about acquiring it by the simplest act, of staying in those marvelous tunnels. </p>
 <p>It spoke of incredible mobility, of endless time to find things, and, above all, of being </p>
 <p>pampered by cosmic servants that would cater to my slightest whims.</p>
 <p>"Aware beings from the most unbelievable corners of the cosmos stay with us," the </p>
 <p>emissary said, ending its talk. "And they love their stay with us. In fact, no one wants to </p>
 <p>leave."</p>
 <p>The thought that crossed my mind at that moment was that servitude was definitely </p>
 <p>antithetical to me. I had never been at ease with servants or with being served.</p>
 <p>The scout took over and made me glide through many tunnels. It came to a halt in a </p>
 <p>tunnel that seemed somehow larger than the others. My dreaming attention became </p>
 <p>riveted on the size and configuration of that tunnel, and it would have stayed glued there </p>
 <p>had I not been made to turn around. My dreaming attention focused then on a blob of </p>
 <p>energy a bit bigger than the shadow entities. It was blue, like the blue in the center of a </p>
 <p>candle's flame. I knew that this energy configuration was not a shadow entity and that it </p>
 <p>did not belong there.</p>
 <p>I became absorbed in sensing it. The scout signaled me to leave, but something was </p>
 <p>making me impervious to its cues. I remained, uneasily, where I was. However, the </p>
 <p>scout's signaling broke my concentration, and I lost sight of the blue shape.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a considerable force made me spin around and put me squarely in front of the </p>
 <p>blue shape. As I gazed at it, it turned into the figure of a person: very small, slender, </p>
 <p>delicate, almost transparent. I desperately attempted to determine whether it was a man or </p>
 <p>a woman, but, hard as I tried, I could not.</p>
 <p>My attempts to ask the emissary failed. It flew away quite abruptly, leaving me </p>
 <p>suspended in that tunnel, facing now an unknown person. I tried to talk to that person the </p>
 <p>way I talked to the emissary. I got no response. I felt a wave of frustration at not being </p>
 <p>able to break the barrier that separated us. Then I was besieged by the fear of being alone </p>
 <p>with someone who might have been an enemy.</p>
 <p>I had a variety of reactions triggered by the presence of that stranger. I even felt elation, </p>
 <p>because I knew that the scout had finally shown me another human being caught in that </p>
 <p>world. I only despaired at the possibility that we were not able to communicate perhaps </p>
 <p>because that stranger was one of the sorcerers of antiquity and belonged to a time </p>
 <p>different from mine.</p>
 <p>The more intense my elation and curiosity, the heavier I became, until a moment in which </p>
 <p>I was so massive that I was back in my body, and back in the world. I found myself in </p>
 <p>Los Angeles, in a park by the University of California. I was standing on the grass, right </p>
 <p>in the line of people playing golf.</p>
 <p>The person in front of me had solidified at the same rate. We stared at each other for a </p>
 <p>fleeting instant. It was a girl, per haps six or seven years old. I thought I knew her. On </p>
 <p>seeing her, my elation and curiosity grew so out of proportion that they triggered a </p>
 <p>reversal. I lost mass so fast that in another instant I was again a blob of energy in the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings' realm The scout came back for me and hurriedly pulled me away.</p>
 <p>I woke up with a jolt of fright. In the process of surfacing into the daily world, something </p>
 <p>had let a message slip through. My mind went into a frenzy trying to put together what I </p>
 <p>knew or thought I knew. I spent more than forty-eight continuous hours attempting to get </p>
 <p>at a hidden feeling or a hidden knowledge that had gotten stuck to me. The only success I </p>
 <p>had was to sense a force-I fancied it to be outside my mind or my body- that told me </p>
 <p>not to trust my dreaming anymore.</p>
 <p>After a few days, a dark and mysterious certainty began to get hold of me, a certainty that </p>
 <p>grew by degrees until I had no doubt about its authenticity: I was sure that the blue blob </p>
 <p>of energy was a prisoner in the inorganic beings' realm.</p>
 <p>I needed don Juan's advice more desperately than ever. I knew that I was throwing years </p>
 <p>of work out the window, but I couldn't help it; I dropped everything 1 was doing and ran </p>
 <p>to Mexico.</p>
 <p>"What do you really want?" don Juan asked me as a way to contain my hysterical </p>
 <p>babbling.</p>
 <p>I could not explain to him what I wanted because I did not know it myself.</p>
 <p>"Your problem must be very serious to make you run like this," don Juan said with a </p>
 <p>pensive expression.</p>
 <p>"It is, in spite of the fact that I can't figure out what my problem really is," I said.</p>
 <p>He asked me to describe my dreaming practices in all the detail that was pertinent. I told </p>
 <p>him about my vision of the little girl and how it had affected me at an emotional level. He </p>
 <p>instantly advised me to ignore the event and regard it as a blatant attempt, on the part of </p>
 <p>the inorganic beings, to cater to my fantasies. He remarked that if dreaming is </p>
 <p>overemphasized, it becomes what it was for the old sorcerers: a source of inexhaustible </p>
 <p>indulging.</p>
 <p>For some inexplicable reason, I was unwilling to tell don Juan about the realm of the </p>
 <p>shadow entities. It was only when he discarded my vision of the little girl that I felt </p>
 <p>obliged to describe to him my visits to that world. He was silent for a long time, as if he </p>
 <p>were overwhelmed.</p>
 <p>When he finally spoke, he said, "You are more alone than I thought, because I can't </p>
 <p>discuss your dreaming practices at all. You are at the position of the old sorcerers. All I </p>
 <p>can do is to repeat to you that you must exercise all the care you are able to muster up."</p>
 <p>"Why do you say that I am at the position of the old sorcerers?"</p>
 <p>"I've told you repeatedly that your mood is dangerously like the old sorcerers'. They </p>
 <p>were very capable beings; their flaw was that they took to the inorganic beings' realm </p>
 <p>like fish take to the water. You are in the same boat. You know things about it that none </p>
 <p>of us can even conceive. For instance, I never knew about the shadows' world; neither </p>
 <p>did the nagual Julian or the nagual Elias, in spite of the fact that he spent a long time in </p>
 <p>the world of the inorganic beings."</p>
 <p>"But what difference does knowing the shadows' world make?"</p>
 <p>"A great deal of difference. Dreamers are taken there only when the inorganic beings are </p>
 <p>sure the dreamers are going to stay in that world. We know this through the old sorcerers' </p>
 <p>stories."</p>
 <p>"I assure you, don Juan, that I have no intention whatsoever of staying there. You talk as </p>
 <p>if I am just about to be lured by promises of service or promises of power. I am not </p>
 <p>interested in either, and that's that."</p>
 <p>"At this level, it isn't that easy anymore. You've gone beyond the point where you could </p>
 <p>simply quit. Besides, you had the misfortune of being singled out by a watery inorganic </p>
 <p>being. Remember how you tumbled with it? And how it felt? I told you then that watery </p>
 <p>inorganic beings are the most annoying. They are dependent and possessive, and once </p>
 <p>they sink their hooks, they never give up."</p>
 <p>"And what does that mean in my case, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"It means real trouble. The specific inorganic being who's running the show is the one </p>
 <p>you grabbed that fatal day. Over the years, it has grown familiar with you. It knows you </p>
 <p>intimately."</p>
 <p>I sincerely remarked to don Juan that the mere idea that an inorganic being knew me </p>
 <p>intimately made me sick to my stomach.</p>
 <p>"When dreamers realize that the inorganic beings have no appeal," he said, "it is usually </p>
 <p>too late for them, because by then the inorganic beings have them in the bag."</p>
 <p>I felt in the depths of me that he was talking abstractly, about dangers that might exist </p>
 <p>theoretically but not in practice. I was secretly convinced there was no danger of any sort.</p>
 <p>"I am not going to allow the inorganic beings to lure me in any way, if that's what you're </p>
 <p>thinking," I said.</p>
 <p>"I am thinking that they are going to trick you," he said. "Like they tricked the nagual </p>
 <p>Rosendo. They are going to set you up, and you won't see the trap or even suspect it. </p>
 <p>They are smooth operators. Now they have even invented a little girl."</p>
 <p>"But there is no doubt in my mind that the little girl exists," I insisted.</p>
 <p>"There is no little girl," he snapped. "That bluish blob of energy is a scout. An explorer </p>
 <p>caught in the inorganic beings' realm. I've said to you that the inorganic beings are like </p>
 <p>fishermen; they attract and catch awareness."</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that he believed, without a doubt, that the bluish blob of energy was from a </p>
 <p>dimension entirely different from ours, a scout that got stranded and caught like a fly in a </p>
 <p>spider's web.</p>
 <p>I did not appreciate his analogy. It worried me to the point of physical discomfort. I did </p>
 <p>mention this to don Juan, and he told me that my concern with the prisoner scout was </p>
 <p>making him feel very close to despair.</p>
 <p>"Why does this bother you?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Something is brewing in that confounded world," he said. "And I can't figure out what it </p>
 <p>is."</p>
 <p>While I remained with don Juan and his companions, I did not dream at all about the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings' world. As usual, my practice was to focus my dreaming attention on the </p>
 <p>items of my dreams and to change dreams. As a way to offset my concerns, don Juan </p>
 <p>made me gaze at clouds and at faraway mountain peaks. The result was an immediate </p>
 <p>feeling of being level with the clouds, or the feeling that I was actually at the faraway </p>
 <p>mountain peaks.</p>
 <p>"I am very pleased, but very worried," don Juan said as a comment on my effort. "You </p>
 <p>are being taught marvels, and you don't even know it. And I don't mean that you are </p>
 <p>being taught by me."</p>
 <p>"You are talking about the inorganic beings, true?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, the inorganic beings. I recommend that you don't gaze at anything; gazing was the </p>
 <p>old sorcerers' technique. They were able to get to their energy bodies in the blink of an </p>
 <p>eye, simply by gazing at objects of their predilection. A very impressive technique, but </p>
 <p>useless to modern sorcerers. It does nothing to increase our sobriety or our capacity to </p>
 <p>seek freedom. All it does is pin us down to concreteness, a most undesirable state."</p>
 <p>Don Juan added that, unless I kept myself in check, by the time I had merged the second </p>
 <p>attention with the attention of my everyday life, I was going to be an insufferable man. </p>
 <p>There was, he said, a dangerous gap between my mobility in the second attention and my </p>
 <p>insistence on immobility in my awareness of the daily world. He remarked that the gap </p>
 <p>between the two was so great that in my daily state I was nearly an idiot, and in the </p>
 <p>second attention I was a lunatic.</p>
 <p>Before I went home, I took the liberty of discussing my dreaming visions of the shadows' </p>
 <p>world with Carol Tiggs, although don Juan had advised me not to discuss them with </p>
 <p>anybody. She was most understanding and most interested, since she was my total </p>
 <p>counterpart. Don Juan was definitely annoyed with me for having revealed my troubles to </p>
 <p>her. I felt worse than ever. Self-pity possessed me, and I began to complain about always </p>
 <p>doing the wrong thing.</p>
 <p>"You haven't done anything yet," don Juan snapped at me. "That much, I know."</p>
 <p>Was he right! On my next dreaming session, at home, all hell broke loose. I reached the </p>
 <p>shadows' world, as I had done on countless occasions; the difference was the presence of </p>
 <p>the blue energy shape. It was among the other shadow beings. I felt it was possible that </p>
 <p>the blob had been there before and I hadn't noticed it. As soon as I spotted it, my </p>
 <p>dreaming attention was inescapably attracted to that blob of energy. In a matter of </p>
 <p>seconds, I was next to it. The other shadows came to me, as usual, but I paid no attention </p>
 <p>to them.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the blue, round shape turned into the little girl I had seen before. She </p>
 <p>craned her thin, delicate, long neck to one side and said in a barely audible whisper, </p>
 <p>"Help me!" Either she said that or I fantasized that she said it. The result was the same: I </p>
 <p>stood frozen, galvanized by genuine concern. I experienced a chill, but not in my energy </p>
 <p>mass. I felt a chill in another part of me. This was the first time I was completely aware </p>
 <p>that my experience was thoroughly separate from my sensorial feelings. I was </p>
 <p>experiencing the shadows' world, with all the implications of what I normally consider </p>
 <p>experiencing: I was able to think, to assess, to make decisions; I had psycho logical </p>
 <p>continuity; in other words, I was myself. The only part of me that was missing was my </p>
 <p>sensorial self. I had no bodily sensations. All my input came through seeing and hearing. </p>
 <p>My rationality then considered a strange dilemma: seeing and hearing were not physical </p>
 <p>faculties but qualities of the visions I was having.</p>
 <p>"You are really seeing and hearing," the emissary's voice said, erupting into my thoughts. </p>
 <p>"That is the beauty of this place. You can experience everything through seeing and </p>
 <p>hearing, without having to breathe. Think of it! You don't have to breathe! You can go </p>
 <p>anywhere in the universe and not breathe."</p>
 <p>A most disquieting ripple of emotion went through me, and, again, I did not feel it there, </p>
 <p>in the shadows' world. I felt it in another place. I became enormously agitated by the </p>
 <p>obvious yet veiled realization that there was a live connection between the me that was </p>
 <p>experiencing and a source of energy, a source of sensorial feeling located somewhere </p>
 <p>else. It occurred to me that this somewhere else was my actual physical body, which was </p>
 <p>asleep in my bed.</p>
 <p>At the instant of this thought, the shadow beings scurried away, and the little girl was </p>
 <p>alone in my field of vision. I watched her and became convinced that I knew her. She </p>
 <p>seemed to falter as if she were about to faint A boundless wave of affection for her </p>
 <p>enveloped me.</p>
 <p>I tried to speak to her, but I was incapable of uttering sounds. It became clear to me then </p>
 <p>that all my dialogues with the emissary had been elicited and accomplished by the </p>
 <p>emissary's energy. Left to my own devices, I was helpless. I attempted next to direct my </p>
 <p>thoughts to the little girl. It was useless. We were separated by a membrane of energy I </p>
 <p>could not pierce.</p>
 <p>The little girl seemed to understand my despair and actually communicated with me, </p>
 <p>directly into my thoughts. She told me, essentially, what don Juan had already said: that </p>
 <p>she was a scout caught in the webs of that world. Then she added that she had adopted </p>
 <p>the shape of a little girl because that shape was familiar to me and to her and that she </p>
 <p>needed my help as much as I needed hers. She said this to me in one clump of energetic </p>
 <p>feeling, which was like words that came to me all at once. I had no difficulty </p>
 <p>understanding her, although this was the first time anything of the sort had happened to </p>
 <p>me.</p>
 <p>I did not know what to do. I tried to convey to her my sensation of incapacity. She </p>
 <p>seemed to comprehend me instantly. She silently appealed to me with a burning look. She </p>
 <p>even smiled as if to let me know that she had left it up to me to extricate her from her </p>
 <p>bonds. When I retorted, in a thought, that I had no abilities whatsoever, she gave me the </p>
 <p>impression of a hysterical child in the throes of despair.</p>
 <p>I frantically tried to talk to her. The little girl actually cried, like a child her age would </p>
 <p>cry, out of desperation and fear. I couldn't stand it. I charged at her, but with no effective </p>
 <p>result. My energy mass went through her. My idea was to lift her up and take her with </p>
 <p>me.</p>
 <p>I attempted the same maneuver over and over until I was exhausted. I stopped to consider </p>
 <p>my next move. I was afraid that my dreaming attention was going to wane, and then I </p>
 <p>would lose sight of her. I doubted that the inorganic beings would bring me back to that </p>
 <p>specific part of their realm. It seemed to me that this was going to be my last visit to </p>
 <p>them:</p>
 <p>the visit that counted.</p>
 <p>Then I did something unthinkable. Before my dreaming attention vanished, I yelled loud </p>
 <p>and clear my intent to merge my energy with the energy of that prisoner scout and set it </p>
 <p>free.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 7</p>
 <p>THE BLUE SCOUT</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>I was dreaming an utterly nonsensical dream. Carol Tiggs was by my side. She was </p>
 <p>speaking to me, although I could not understand what she said. Don Juan was also in my </p>
 <p>dream, as were all the members of his party. They seemed to be trying to drag me out of a </p>
 <p>foggy yellowish world.</p>
 <p>After a serious effort, during which I lost and regained sight of them various times, they </p>
 <p>succeeded in extricating me from that place. Since I could not conceive the sense of all </p>
 <p>that endeavor, I finally figured that I was having a normal, incoherent dream.</p>
 <p>My surprise was staggering when I woke up and found myself in bed, in don Juan's </p>
 <p>house. I was incapable of moving. I had no energy at all. I did not know what to think, </p>
 <p>although I immediately sensed the gravity of my situation. I had the vague feeling that I </p>
 <p>had lost my energy because of fatigue caused by dreaming.</p>
 <p>Don Juan's companions seemed to be extremely affected by whatever was happening to </p>
 <p>me. They kept on coming into my room, one at a time. Each stayed for a moment, in </p>
 <p>complete silence, until someone else showed up. It appeared to me that they were taking </p>
 <p>turns watching over me. I was too weak to ask them to explain their behavior.</p>
 <p>During the subsequent days, I began to feel better, and they started to talk to me about my </p>
 <p>dreaming. At first, I did not know what they wanted of me. Then it dawned on me, </p>
 <p>because of their questions, that they were obsessed with the shadow beings. Every one of </p>
 <p>them appeared to be scared and said to me more or less the same thing. They insisted that </p>
 <p>they had never been in the shadows' world. Some of them even claimed that they did not </p>
 <p>know it existed. Their claims and reactions increased my sense of bewilderment and my </p>
 <p>feat</p>
 <p>The questions everyone asked were, "Who took you into that world? Or how did you </p>
 <p>even begin to know how to get there?" When I told them that the scouts had shown me </p>
 <p>that world, they could not believe me. Obviously, they had surmised that I had been </p>
 <p>there, but since it was not possible for them to use their personal experience as a </p>
 <p>reference point, they were unable to fathom what I was saying. Yet they still wanted to </p>
 <p>know all I could tell them about the shadow beings and their realm. I obliged them. All of </p>
 <p>them, with the exception of don Juan, sat by my bed, hanging on every word I said. </p>
 <p>However, every time I asked them about my situation, they scurried away, just like the </p>
 <p>shadow beings..</p>
 <p>Another disturbing reaction, which they never had before, was that they frantically </p>
 <p>avoided any physical contact with me. They kept their distance, as if I were carrying the </p>
 <p>plague. Their reaction worried me so much that I felt obliged to ask them about it. They </p>
 <p>denied it. They seemed insulted and even went so far as to insist on proving to me that I </p>
 <p>was wrong. I laughed heartily at the tense situation that ensued. Their bodies went rigid </p>
 <p>every time they tried to embrace me.</p>
 <p>Florinda Grau, don Juan's closest cohort, was the only member of his party who lavished </p>
 <p>physical attention on me and tried to explain to me what was going on. She told me that I </p>
 <p>had been discharged of energy in the inorganic beings' world and charged again, but that </p>
 <p>my new energetic charge was a bit disturbing to the majority of them.</p>
 <p>Florinda used to put me to bed every night, as if I were an invalid. She even spoke to me </p>
 <p>in baby talk, which all of them celebrated with gales of laughter. But regardless of how </p>
 <p>she made fun of me, I appreciated her concern, which seemed to be real.</p>
 <p>I have written about Florinda before in connection with my meeting her. She was by far </p>
 <p>the most beautiful woman I had ever met. Once I said to her, and I really meant it, that </p>
 <p>she could have been a fashion magazine model. "Of a magazine of nineteen ten," she </p>
 <p>retorted.</p>
 <p>Florinda, although she was old, was not old at all. She was young and vibrant. When I </p>
 <p>asked don Juan about her unusual youthfulness, he replied that sorcery kept her in a vital </p>
 <p>state. Sorcerers' energy, he remarked, was seen by the eye as youth and vigor.</p>
 <p>After satisfying their initial curiosity about the shadows' world, don Juan's companions </p>
 <p>stopped coming into my room, and their conversation remained at the level of casual </p>
 <p>inquiries about my health. Every time I tried to get up, however, there was someone </p>
 <p>around who gently put me back to bed. I did not want their ministrations, yet it seemed </p>
 <p>that I needed them; I was weak I accepted that. But what really took its toll on me was </p>
 <p>not having anyone explain to me what I was doing in Mexico when I had gone to bed to </p>
 <p>dream in Los Angeles. I asked them repeatedly. Every one of them gave me the same </p>
 <p>answer, "Ask the nagual. He's the only one who can explain it."</p>
 <p>Finally, Florinda broke the ice. "You were lured into a trap; that's what happened to </p>
 <p>you," she said.</p>
 <p>"Where was I lured into a trap?"</p>
 <p>"In the world of the inorganic beings, of course. That has been the world you've been </p>
 <p>dealing with for years. Isn't that so?"</p>
 <p>"Most definitely, Florinda. But can you tell me about the kind of trap it was?"</p>
 <p>"Not really. All I can tell you is that you lost all your energy there. But you fought very </p>
 <p>well."</p>
 <p>"Why am I sick, Florinda?"</p>
 <p>"You are not sick with an illness; you were energetically wounded. You were critical, but </p>
 <p>now you are only gravely wounded."</p>
 <p>"How did all this happen?"</p>
 <p>"You entered into a mortal combat with the inorganic beings, and you were defeated."</p>
 <p>"I don't remember fighting anyone, Florinda."</p>
 <p>"Whether you remember or not is immaterial. You fought and were outclassed. You </p>
 <p>didn't have a chance against those masterful manipulators."</p>
 <p>"I fought the inorganic beings?"</p>
 <p>"Yes. You had a mortal encounter with them. I really don't know how you have survived </p>
 <p>their death blow."</p>
 <p>She refused to tell me anything else and hinted that the nagual was coming to see me any </p>
 <p>day.</p>
 <p>The next day don Juan showed up. He was very jovial and supportive. He jokingly </p>
 <p>announced that he was paying me a visit in his capacity of energy doctor. He examined </p>
 <p>me by gazing at me from head to toe. "You're almost cured," he concluded.</p>
 <p>"What happened to me, don Juan?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"You fell into a trap the inorganic beings set for you," he answered.</p>
 <p>"How did I end up here?"</p>
 <p>"Right there is the big mystery, for sure," he said and smiled jovially, obviously frying to </p>
 <p>make light of a serious matter. "The inorganic beings snatched you, body and all. First </p>
 <p>they took your energy body into their realm, when you followed one of their scouts, and </p>
 <p>then they took your physical body."</p>
 <p>Don Juan's companions seemed to be in a state of shock. One of them asked don Juan </p>
 <p>whether the inorganic beings could abduct anyone. Don Juan answered that they certainly </p>
 <p>could. He reminded them that the nagual Elias was taken into that universe, and he </p>
 <p>definitely did not intend to go there.</p>
 <p>All of them assented with a nod. Don Juan continued speaking to them, referring to me in </p>
 <p>the third person. He said that the combined awareness of a group of inorganic beings had </p>
 <p>first consumed my energy body by forcing an emotional out burst from me: to free the </p>
 <p>blue scout. Then the combined awareness of the same group of inorganic beings had </p>
 <p>pulled my inert physical mass into their world. Don Juan added that without the energy </p>
 <p>body one is merely a lump of organic matter that can be easily manipulated by awareness.</p>
 <p>"The inorganic beings are glued together, like the cells of the body," don Juan went on. </p>
 <p>"When they put their awareness together, they are unbeatable. It's nothing for them to </p>
 <p>yank us out of our moorings and plunge us into their world. Especially if we make </p>
 <p>ourselves conspicuous and available, like he did."</p>
 <p>Their sighs and gasps echoed against the walls. All of them seemed to be genuinely </p>
 <p>frightened and concerned.</p>
 <p>I wanted to whine and blame don Juan for not stopping me, but I remembered how he had </p>
 <p>tried to warn me, to deviate me, time and time again, to no avail. Don Juan was definitely </p>
 <p>aware of what was going on in my mind. He gave a knowing smile.</p>
 <p>"The reason you think you're sick," he said, addressing me, "is that the inorganic beings </p>
 <p>discharged your energy and gave you theirs. That should have been enough to kill </p>
 <p>anyone. As the nagual, you have extra energy; therefore, you barely survived."</p>
 <p>I mentioned to don Juan that I remembered bits and pieces of quite an incoherent dream, </p>
 <p>in which I was in a yellow-fogged world. He, Carol Tiggs, and his companions were </p>
 <p>pulling me out.</p>
 <p>"The inorganic beings' realm looks like a yellow-fog world to the physical eye," he said. </p>
 <p>"When you thought you were having an incoherent dream, you were actually looking </p>
 <p>with your physical eyes, for the first time, at the inorganic beings' universe. And, strange </p>
 <p>as it may seem to you, it was also the first time for us. We knew about the fog only </p>
 <p>through sorcerers' stories, not through experience."</p>
 <p>Nothing of what he was saying made sense to me. Don Juan assured me that, because of </p>
 <p>my lack of energy, a more complete explanation was impossible; I had to be satisfied, he </p>
 <p>said, with what he was telling me and how I understood it.</p>
 <p>"1 don't understand it at all," I insisted.</p>
 <p>"Then you haven't lost anything," he said. "When you get stronger, you yourself will </p>
 <p>answer your questions."</p>
 <p>I confessed to don Juan that I was having hot flashes. My temperature rose suddenly, and, </p>
 <p>while I felt hot and sweaty I had extraordinary but disturbing insights into my situation.</p>
 <p>Don Juan scanned my entire body with his penetrating gaze. He said that I was in a state </p>
 <p>of energetic shock. Losing energy had temporarily affected me, and what I interpreted as </p>
 <p>hot flashes were, in essence, blasts of energy during which I momentarily regained </p>
 <p>control of my energy body and knew everything that had happened to me.</p>
 <p>"Make an effort, and tell me yourself what happened to you in the inorganic beings' </p>
 <p>world," he ordered me.</p>
 <p>I told him that the clear sensation I got, from time to time, was that he and his </p>
 <p>companions had gone into that world with their physical bodies and had snatched me out </p>
 <p>of the inorganic beings' clutches.</p>
 <p>"Right!" he exclaimed. "You're doing fine. Now, turn that sensation into a view of what </p>
 <p>happened."</p>
 <p>I was unable to do what he wanted, hard as I tried. Failing made me experience an </p>
 <p>unusual fatigue, which seemed to dry up the inside of my body. Before don Juan left the </p>
 <p>room, I remarked to him that I was suffering from anxiety</p>
 <p>"That means nothing," he said, unconcerned. "Gain back your energy, and don't worry </p>
 <p>about nonsense."</p>
 <p>More than two weeks went by, during which I slowly gained back my energy However, I </p>
 <p>kept on worrying about every thing. I worried mainly about being unknown to myself, </p>
 <p>especially about a streak of coldness in me that I had not noticed before, a sort of </p>
 <p>indifference, a detachment that I had attributed to my lack of energy until I regained it. </p>
 <p>Then I realized that it was a new feature of my being, a feature that had me permanently </p>
 <p>out of synchronization. To elicit the feelings I was accustomed to, I had to summon them </p>
 <p>up and actually wait a moment until they made their appearance in my mind.</p>
 <p>Another new feature of my being was a strange longing that took hold of me from time to </p>
 <p>time. I longed for someone I did not know; it was such an overpowering and consuming </p>
 <p>feeling that, when I experienced it, I had to move around the room incessantly to alleviate </p>
 <p>it. The longing remained with me until I made use of another newcomer in my life: a </p>
 <p>rigid control of myself, so new and powerful that it only added more fuel to my worrying.</p>
 <p>By the end of the fourth week, everybody felt that I was finally cured. They cut down </p>
 <p>their visits drastically. I spent much of the time alone, sleeping. The rest and relaxation I </p>
 <p>was getting was so complete that my energy began to increase remarkably. I felt like my </p>
 <p>old self again. I even began to exercise.</p>
 <p>One day around noon after a light lunch, I returned to my room to take a nap. Just before </p>
 <p>I sank into a deep sleep, I was tossing in my bed, trying to find a more comfortable spot, </p>
 <p>when a strange pressure on my temples made me open my eyes. The little girl of the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings' world was standing by the foot of my bed, peering at me with her cold, </p>
 <p>steel blue eyes.</p>
 <p>I jumped out of bed and screamed so loudly that three of don Juan's companions were in </p>
 <p>the room before I had stopped my scream. They were aghast. They watched in horror as </p>
 <p>the little girl came to me and was stopped by the boundaries of my luminous physical </p>
 <p>being. We looked at each other for an eternity. She was telling me something, which I </p>
 <p>could not comprehend at first but which in the next moment became as clear as a bell. </p>
 <p>She said that for me to understand what she was saying, my awareness had to be </p>
 <p>transferred from my physical body into my energy body.</p>
 <p>Don Juan came into the room at that moment. The little girl and don Juan stared at each </p>
 <p>other. Without a word, don Juan turned around and walked out of the room. The little girl </p>
 <p>swished past the door after him.</p>
 <p>The commotion this scene created among don Juan's companions was indescribable. </p>
 <p>They lost all their composure. Apparently, all of them had seen the little girl as she left </p>
 <p>the room with the nagual.</p>
 <p>I myself seemed to be on the verge of exploding. I felt faint and had to sit down. I had </p>
 <p>experienced the presence of the little girl as a blow on my solar plexus. She bore an </p>
 <p>astonishing likeness to my father. Waves of sentiment hit me. I wondered about the </p>
 <p>meaning of this until I was actually sick.</p>
 <p>When don Juan returned to the room, I had gained minimal control over myself. The </p>
 <p>expectation of hearing what he had to say about the little girl was making my breathing </p>
 <p>very difficult. Everybody was as excited as I was. They all talked to don Juan at once and </p>
 <p>laughed when they realized what they were doing. Their main interest was to find out </p>
 <p>whether there was any uniformity in the way they had perceived the scout's appearance. </p>
 <p>Everybody was in agreement that they had seen a little girl, six to seven years old, very </p>
 <p>thin, with angular, beautiful features. They also agreed that her eyes were steel blue and </p>
 <p>burning with a mute emotion; her eyes, they said, expressed gratitude and loyalty.</p>
 <p>Every detail they described about the little girl I corroborated myself. Her eyes were so </p>
 <p>bright and overpowering that they had actually caused me something like pain. I had felt </p>
 <p>the weight of her look on my chest.</p>
 <p>A serious query, which don Juan's companions had and which I echoed myself, was </p>
 <p>about the implications of this event. All agreed that the scout was a portion of foreign </p>
 <p>energy that had filtered through the walls separating the second attention and the </p>
 <p>attention of the daily world. They asserted that since they were not dreaming and yet all </p>
 <p>of them had seen the alien energy projected into the figure of a human child; that child </p>
 <p>had existence.</p>
 <p>They argued that there must have been hundreds, if not thousands, of cases in which </p>
 <p>foreign energy slips unnoticed through natural barriers into our human world, but that in </p>
 <p>the history of their lineage there was no mention whatsoever of an event of this nature. </p>
 <p>What worried them the most was that there were no sorcerers' stories about it.</p>
 <p>"Is this the first time in the history of mankind that this has happened?" one of them </p>
 <p>asked don Juan.</p>
 <p>"I think it happens all the time," he replied, "but it has never happened in such an overt, </p>
 <p>volitional way."</p>
 <p>"What does it mean to us?" another one of them asked don Juan.</p>
 <p>"Nothing to us, but everything to him," he said and pointed at me.</p>
 <p>All of them then entered into a most disturbing silence. Don Juan paced back and forth </p>
 <p>for a moment. Then he stopped in front of me and peered at me, giving all the indications </p>
 <p>of someone who cannot find words to express an overwhelming realization.</p>
 <p>"I can't even begin to assess the scope of what you've done," don Juan finally said to me </p>
 <p>in a tone of bewilderment. "You fell into a pitfall, but it wasn't the kind of pitfall I was </p>
 <p>worrying about. Your pitfall was designed for you alone, and it was deadlier than </p>
 <p>anything I could have thought of. I worried about your falling prey to flattery and being </p>
 <p>served. What I never counted on was that the shadow beings would set a trap using your </p>
 <p>inherent aversion to chains."</p>
 <p>Don Juan had once made a comparison of his reaction and mine, in the sorcerers' world, </p>
 <p>to the things that pressed us the most. He said, without making it sound like a complaint, </p>
 <p>that although he wanted and tried to, he had never been able to inspire the kind of </p>
 <p>affection his teacher, the nagual Julian, inspired in people.</p>
 <p>"My unbiased reaction, which I am putting on the table for you to examine, is to be able </p>
 <p>to say, and mean it: it's not my fate to evoke blind and total affection. So be it!"</p>
 <p>"Your unbiased reaction," he went on, "is that you can't stand chains, and you would </p>
 <p>forfeit your life to break them."</p>
 <p>I sincerely disagreed with him and told him that he was exaggerating. My views were not </p>
 <p>that clear.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry," he said laughing, "sorcery is action. When the time comes, you'll act your </p>
 <p>passion the same way I act mine. Mine is to acquiesce to my fate, not passively, like an </p>
 <p>idiot, but actively, like a warrior. Yours is to jump without either capriciousness or </p>
 <p>premeditation to cut someone else's chains."</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that upon merging my energy with the scout I had truthfully ceased </p>
 <p>to exist. All my physicalness had then been transported into the inorganic beings' realm </p>
 <p>and, had it not been for the scout who guided don Juan and his companions to where I </p>
 <p>was, I would have died or remained in that world, inextricably lost.</p>
 <p>"Why did the scout guide you to where I was?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"The scout is a sentient being from another dimension," he said. "It's a little girl now, </p>
 <p>and as such she told me that in order to get the energy to break the barrier that had </p>
 <p>trapped her in the inorganic beings' world, she had to take all of yours. That's her human </p>
 <p>part now. Something resembling gratitude drove her to me. When I saw her, I knew </p>
 <p>instantly that you were done for."</p>
 <p>"What did you do then, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"I rounded up everyone I could get hold of, especially Carol Tiggs, and off we went into </p>
 <p>the inorganic beings' realm."</p>
 <p>"Why Carol Tiggs?"</p>
 <p>"In the first place, because she has endless energy, and, in the second place, because she </p>
 <p>had to familiarize herself with the scout. All of us got something invaluable out of this </p>
 <p>experience. You and Carol Tiggs got the scout. And the rest of us got a reason to round </p>
 <p>up our physicality and place it on our energy bodies; we became energy."</p>
 <p>"How did all of you do that, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"We displaced our assemblage points, in unison. Our impeccable intent to save you did </p>
 <p>the work. The scout took us, in the blink of an eye, to where you were lying, half dead, </p>
 <p>and Carol dragged you out."</p>
 <p>His explanation made no sense to me. Don Juan laughed when I tried to raise that point.</p>
 <p>"How can you understand this when you don't even have enough energy to get out of </p>
 <p>your bed?" he retorted.</p>
 <p>I confided to him that I was certain I knew infinitely more than I rationally admitted but </p>
 <p>that something was keeping a tight lid on my memory.</p>
 <p>"Lack of energy is what has put a tight lid on your memory," he said. "When you have </p>
 <p>sufficient energy, your memory will work fine."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean that I can remember everything if I want to?"</p>
 <p>"Not quite. You may want as much as you like, but if your energy level is not on a par </p>
 <p>with the importance of what you know, you might as well kiss your knowledge good-bye: </p>
 <p>it'll never be available to you."</p>
 <p>"So what's the thing to do, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Energy tends to be cumulative; if you follow the warrior's way impeccably, a moment </p>
 <p>will come when your memory opens up."</p>
 <p>I confessed that hearing him talk gave me the absurd sensation that I was indulging in </p>
 <p>feeling sorry for myself, that there was nothing wrong with me.</p>
 <p>"You are not just indulging," he said. "You were actually energetically dead four weeks </p>
 <p>ago. Now you are merely stunned. Being stunned and lacking energy is what makes you </p>
 <p>hide your knowledge. You certainly know more than any of us about the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings' world. That world was the exclusive concern of the old sorcerers. All of us have </p>
 <p>told you that only through sorcerers' stories do we know about it. I sincerely say that it is </p>
 <p>more than strange to me that you've become, in your own right, another source of </p>
 <p>sorcerers' stories for us."</p>
 <p>I reiterated that it was impossible for me to believe I had done something he had not. But </p>
 <p>I could not believe either that he was merely humoring me.</p>
 <p>"I am not flattering or humoring you," he said, visibly annoyed. "I am stating a sorcery </p>
 <p>fact. Knowing more than any of us about that world shouldn't be a reason for feeling </p>
 <p>pleased. There's no advantage in that knowledge; in fact, in spite of all you know, you </p>
 <p>couldn't save yourself. We saved you, because we found you. But without the aid of the </p>
 <p>scout, there was no point in even trying to find you. You were so infinitely lost in that </p>
 <p>world that I shudder at the mere thought."</p>
 <p>In my state of mind, I did not find it strange in the least that I actually saw a ripple of </p>
 <p>emotion going through all of don Juan's companions and apprentices. The one who </p>
 <p>remained unaltered was Carol Tiggs. She seemed to have fully accepted her role. She was </p>
 <p>one with me.</p>
 <p>"You did free the scout," don Juan continued, "but you gave up your life. Or, worse yet, </p>
 <p>you gave up your freedom. The inorganic beings let the scout go, in exchange for you."</p>
 <p>"I can hardly believe that, don Juan. Not that I doubt you, you understand, but you </p>
 <p>describe such an underhanded maneuver that I am stunned."</p>
 <p>"Don't consider it underhanded and you have the whole thing in a nutshell. The inorganic </p>
 <p>beings are forever in search of awareness and energy; if you supply them with the </p>
 <p>possibility of both, what do you think they'll do? Blow you kisses from across the </p>
 <p>street?"</p>
 <p>I knew that don Juan was right. However, I could not hold that certainty for too long; </p>
 <p>clarity kept drifting away from me.</p>
 <p>Don Juan's companions continued asking him questions.</p>
 <p>They wanted to know if he had given any thought to what to do with the scout.</p>
 <p>"Yes, I have. It is a most serious problem, which the nagual here has to resolve," he said, </p>
 <p>pointing at me. "He and Carol Tiggs are the only ones who can free the scout. And he </p>
 <p>knows it too."</p>
 <p>Naturally, I asked him the only possible question, "How can I free it?"</p>
 <p>"Instead of my telling you how, there is a much better and more just way of finding out," </p>
 <p>don Juan said with big smile.</p>
 <p>"Ask the emissary. The inorganic beings cannot lie, you know."</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 8</p>
 <p>THE THIRD GATE OF DREAMING</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>The third gate of dreaming is reached when you find yourself in a dream, staring at </p>
 <p>someone else who is asleep. And that someone else turns out to be you," don Juan said.</p>
 <p>My energy level was so keyed up at the time that I went to work on the third task right </p>
 <p>away, although he did not offer any more information about it. The first thing I noticed, </p>
 <p>in my dreaming practices, was that a surge of energy immediately rearranged the focus of </p>
 <p>my dreaming attention. Its focus was now on waking up in a dream and seeing myself </p>
 <p>sleeping; journeying to the realm of inorganic beings was no longer an issue for me.</p>
 <p>Very soon after, I found myself in a dream looking at myself asleep. I immediately </p>
 <p>reported it to don Juan. The dream had happened while I was at his house.</p>
 <p>"There are two phases to each of the gates of dreaming," he said. "The first, as you know, </p>
 <p>is to arrive at the gate; the second is to cross it. By dreaming what you've dreamt, that </p>
 <p>you saw yourself asleep, you arrived at the third gate. The second phase is to move </p>
 <p>around once you've seen yourself asleep.</p>
 <p>"At the third gate of dreaming," he went on, "you begin to deliberately merge your </p>
 <p>dreaming reality with the reality of the daily world. This is the drill, and sorcerers call it </p>
 <p>completing the energy body. The merge between the two realities has to be so thorough </p>
 <p>that you need to be more fluid than ever. Examine everything at the third gate with great </p>
 <p>care and curiosity."</p>
 <p>I complained that his recommendations were too cryptic and were not making any sense </p>
 <p>to me. "What do you mean by great care and curiosity?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Our tendency at the third gate is to get lost in detail," he replied. "To view things with </p>
 <p>great care and curiosity means to resist the nearly irresistible temptation to plunge into </p>
 <p>detail.</p>
 <p>"The given drill, at the third gate, as I said, is to consolidate the energy body. Dreamers </p>
 <p>begin forging the energy body by fulfilling the drills of the first and second gates. When </p>
 <p>they reach the third gate, the energy body is ready to come out, or perhaps it would be </p>
 <p>better to say that it is ready to act. Unfortunately, this also means that it's ready to be </p>
 <p>mesmerized by detail."</p>
 <p>"What does it mean to be mesmerized by detail?"</p>
 <p>"The energy body is like a child who's been imprisoned all its life. The moment it is free, </p>
 <p>it soaks up everything it can find, and I mean everything. Every irrelevant, minute detail </p>
 <p>totally absorbs the energy body."</p>
 <p>An awkward silence followed. I had no idea what to say. I had understood him perfectly, </p>
 <p>I just didn't have anything in my experience to give me an idea of exactly what it all </p>
 <p>meant.</p>
 <p>"The most asinine detail becomes a world for the energy body," don Juan explained. </p>
 <p>"The effort that dreamers have to make to direct the energy body is staggering. I know </p>
 <p>that it sounds awkward to tell you to view things with care and curiosity but that is the </p>
 <p>best way to describe what you should do. At the third gate, dreamers have to avoid a </p>
 <p>nearly irresistible impulse to plunge into everything, and they avoid it by being so </p>
 <p>curious, so desperate to get into everything that they don't let any particular thing </p>
 <p>imprison them."</p>
 <p>Don Juan added that his recommendations, which he knew sounded absurd to the mind, </p>
 <p>were directly aimed at my energy body. He stressed over and over that my energy body </p>
 <p>had to unite all its resources in order to act.</p>
 <p>"But hasn't my energy body been acting all along?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Part of it has, otherwise you wouldn't have journeyed to the inorganic beings' realm," </p>
 <p>he replied. "Now your entire energy body has to be engaged to perform the drill of the </p>
 <p>third gate. Therefore, to make things easier for your energy body, you must hold back </p>
 <p>your rationality."</p>
 <p>"I am afraid you are barking up the wrong tree," I said. "There is very little rationality </p>
 <p>left in me after all the experiences you've brought into my life."</p>
 <p>"Don't say anything. At the third gate, rationality is responsible for the insistence of our </p>
 <p>energy bodies on being obsessed with superfluous detail. At the third gate, then, we need </p>
 <p>irrational fluidity, irrational abandon to counteract that insistence."</p>
 <p>Don Juan's statement that each gate is an obstacle could not have been more truthful. I </p>
 <p>labored to fulfill the drill of the third gate of dreaming more intensely than I had on the </p>
 <p>other two tasks combined. Don Juan put tremendous pressure on me. Besides, something </p>
 <p>else had been added to my life: a true sense of fear. I had been normally and even </p>
 <p>excessively afraid of one thing or another throughout my life, but there had been nothing </p>
 <p>in my experience comparable to the fear I felt after my bout with the inorganic beings. </p>
 <p>Yet all this wealth of experience was inaccessible to my normal memory. Only in the </p>
 <p>presence of don Juan were those memories at my disposal.</p>
 <p>I asked him about this strange situation once when we were at the National Museum of </p>
 <p>Anthropology and History in Mexico City. What had prompted my question was that, at </p>
 <p>the moment, I had the odd ability to remember everything that had happened to me in the </p>
 <p>course of my association with don Juan. And that made me feel so free, so daring and </p>
 <p>light-footed that I was practically dancing around.</p>
 <p>"It just happens that the presence of the nagual induces a shift of the assemblage point," </p>
 <p>he said.</p>
 <p>He guided me then into one of the display rooms of the museum and said that my </p>
 <p>question was apropos to what he had been planning to tell me.</p>
 <p>"My intention was to explain to you that the position of the assemblage point is like a </p>
 <p>vault where sorcerers keep their records," he said. "I was tickled pink when your energy </p>
 <p>body felt my intent and you asked me about it. The energy body knows immensities. Let </p>
 <p>me show you how much it knows."</p>
 <p>He instructed me to enter into total silence. He reminded me that I was already in a </p>
 <p>special state of awareness, because my assemblage point had been made to shift by his </p>
 <p>presence. He assured me that entering into total silence was going to allow the sculptures </p>
 <p>in that room to make me see and hear inconceivable things. He added, apparently to </p>
 <p>increase my confusion, that some of the archaeological pieces in that room had the </p>
 <p>capacity to produce, by themselves, a shift of the assemblage point, and that if I reached a </p>
 <p>state of total silence I would be actually witnessing scenes pertaining to the lives of the </p>
 <p>people who made those pieces.</p>
 <p>He then began the strangest tour of a museum I have ever taken. He went around the </p>
 <p>room, describing and interpreting astounding details of every one of the large pieces. </p>
 <p>According to him, every archaeological piece in that room was a purposeful record left </p>
 <p>by the people of antiquity, a record that don Juan as a sorcerer was reading to me as one </p>
 <p>would read a book:</p>
 <p>"Every piece here is designed to make the assemblage point shift," he went on. "Fix your </p>
 <p>gaze on any of them, silence your mind, and find out whether or not your assemblage </p>
 <p>point can be made to shift."</p>
 <p>"How would I know that it has shifted?"</p>
 <p>"Because you would see and feel things that are beyond your normal reach."</p>
 <p>I gazed at the sculptures and saw and heard things that I would be at a loss to explain. In </p>
 <p>the past, I had examined all those pieces with the bias of anthropology, always bearing in </p>
 <p>mind the descriptions of scholars in the field. Their descriptions of the functions of those </p>
 <p>pieces, rooted in modem man's cognition of the world, appeared to me, for the first time, </p>
 <p>to be utterly prejudiced if not asinine. What don Juan said about those pieces and what I </p>
 <p>heard and saw myself, gazing at them, was the farthest thing from what I had always read </p>
 <p>about them.</p>
 <p>My discomfort was so great that I felt obliged to apologize to don Juan for what I thought </p>
 <p>was my suggestibility. He did not laugh or make fun of me. He patiently explained that </p>
 <p>sorcerers were capable of leaving accurate records of their findings in the position of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point. He maintained that when it comes to getting to the essence of a written </p>
 <p>account, we have to use our sense of sympathetic or imaginative participation to go </p>
 <p>beyond the mere page into the experience itself. However, in the sorcerers' world, since </p>
 <p>there are no written pages, total records, which can be relived instead of read, are left in </p>
 <p>the position of the assemblage point.</p>
 <p>To illustrate his argument, don Juan talked about the sorcerers' teachings for the second </p>
 <p>attention. He said that they are given when the apprentice's assemblage point is on a </p>
 <p>place other than the normal one. The position of the assemblage point becomes, in this </p>
 <p>manner, the record of the lesson. In order to play the lesson back, the apprentice has to </p>
 <p>return his assemblage point to the position it occupied when the lesson was given. Don </p>
 <p>Juan concluded his remarks by reiterating that to return the assemblage point to all the </p>
 <p>positions it occupied when the lessons were given is an accomplishment of the highest </p>
 <p>magnitude.</p>
 <p>For nearly a year, don Juan did not ask me anything about my third dreaming task. Then </p>
 <p>one day, quite abruptly, he wanted me to describe to him all the nuances of my dreaming </p>
 <p>practices.</p>
 <p>The first thing I mentioned was a baffling recurrence. For a period of months, I had </p>
 <p>dreams in which I found myself staring at me, sleeping in my bed. The odd part was the </p>
 <p>regularity of those dreams; they happened every four days, like clockwork. During the </p>
 <p>other three days, my dreaming was what it always had been so far: I examined every </p>
 <p>possible item in my dreams, I changed dreams, and occasionally, driven by a suicidal </p>
 <p>curiosity I followed the foreign energy scouts, although I felt extremely guilty doing this. </p>
 <p>I fancied it to be like having a secret drug addiction. The realness of that world was </p>
 <p>irresistible to me.</p>
 <p>Secretly, I felt somehow exonerated from total responsibility, because don Juan himself </p>
 <p>had suggested that I ask the dreaming emissary about what to do to free the blue scout </p>
 <p>trapped among us. He meant for me to pose the question in my every day practice, but I </p>
 <p>construed his statement to imply that I had to ask the emissary while I was in its world. </p>
 <p>The question I really wanted to ask the emissary was whether the inorganic beings had </p>
 <p>set a trap for me. The emissary not only told me that everything don Juan had said was </p>
 <p>true but also gave me instructions on what Carol Tiggs and I had to do to liberate the </p>
 <p>scout.</p>
 <p>"The regularity of your dreams is something that I rather expected," don Juan remarked, </p>
 <p>after listening to me.</p>
 <p>"Why did you expect something like that, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Because of your relationship with the inorganic beings."</p>
 <p>"That's over and forgotten, don Juan," I lied, hoping he would not pursue the subject any </p>
 <p>further.</p>
 <p>"You are saying that for my benefit, aren't you? You don't need to; I know the true story. </p>
 <p>Believe me, once you get to play with them, you are hooked. They'll always be after you. </p>
 <p>Or, what's worse yet, you'll always be after them."</p>
 <p>He stared at me, and my guilt must have been so obvious that it made him laugh.</p>
 <p>"The only possible explanation for such regularity is that the inorganic beings are </p>
 <p>catering to you again," don Juan said in a serious tone.</p>
 <p>I hurried to change the subject and told him that another nuance of my dreaming practices </p>
 <p>worth mentioning was my reaction to the sight of myself lying sound asleep. That view </p>
 <p>was always so startling that it either glued me to the spot until the dream changed or </p>
 <p>frightened me so profoundly that it made me wake up, screaming at the top of my voice. I </p>
 <p>had gotten to the point where I was afraid to go to sleep on the days I knew I was going </p>
 <p>to have that dream.</p>
 <p>"You are not yet ready for a true merging of your dreaming reality and your daily </p>
 <p>reality," he concluded. "You must recapitulate your life further."</p>
 <p>"But I've done all the recapitulating possible," I protested. "I've been recapitulating for </p>
 <p>years. There is nothing more I can remember about my life."</p>
 <p>"There must be much more," he said adamantly, "otherwise, you wouldn't wake up </p>
 <p>screaming."</p>
 <p>I did not like the idea of having to recapitulate again. I had done it, and I believed I had </p>
 <p>done it so well that I did not need to touch the subject ever again.</p>
 <p>"The recapitulation of our lives never ends, no matter how well we've done it once," don </p>
 <p>Juan said. "The reason average people lack volition in their dreams is that they have </p>
 <p>never recapitulated and their lives are filled to capacity with heavily loaded emotions like </p>
 <p>memories, hopes, fears, et cetera, ct cetera.</p>
 <p>"Sorcerers, in contrast, are relatively free from heavy binding emotions, because of their </p>
 <p>recapitulation. And if something stops them, as it has stopped you at this moment, the </p>
 <p>assumption is that there still is something in them that is not quite clear."</p>
 <p>"To recapitulate is too involving, don Juan. Maybe there is something else I can do </p>
 <p>instead."</p>
 <p>"No. There isn't. Recapitulating and dreaming go hand in hand. As we regurgitate our </p>
 <p>lives, we get more and more airborne."</p>
 <p>Don Juan had given me very detailed and explicit instructions about the recapitulation. It </p>
 <p>consisted of reliving the totality of one's life experiences by remembering every possible </p>
 <p>minute detail of them. He saw the recapitulation as the essential factor in a dreamer's </p>
 <p>redefinition and redeployment of energy "The recapitulation sets free energy imprisoned </p>
 <p>within us, and without this liberated energy dreaming is not possible." That was his </p>
 <p>statement.</p>
 <p>Years before, don Juan had coached me to make a list of all the people I had met in my </p>
 <p>life, starting at the present. He helped me to arrange my list in an orderly fashion, </p>
 <p>breaking it down into areas of activity, such as jobs I had had, schools I had attended. </p>
 <p>Then he guided me to go, without deviation, from the first person on my list to the last </p>
 <p>one, reliving every one of my interactions with them.</p>
 <p>He explained that recapitulating an event starts with one's mind arranging everything </p>
 <p>pertinent to what is being recapitulated. Arranging means reconstructing the event, piece </p>
 <p>by piece, starting by recollecting the physical details of the surroundings, then going to </p>
 <p>the person with whom one shared the interaction, and then going to oneself, to the </p>
 <p>examination of one's feelings.</p>
 <p>Don Juan taught me that the recapitulation is coupled with a natural, rhythmical </p>
 <p>breathing. Long exhalations are performed as the head moves gently and slowly from </p>
 <p>right to left; and long inhalations are taken as the head moves back from left to right. He </p>
 <p>called this act of moving the head from side to side "fanning the event." The mind </p>
 <p>examines the event from beginning to end while the body fans, on and on, everything the </p>
 <p>mind focuses on.</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that the sorcerers of antiquity, the inventors of the recapitulation, viewed </p>
 <p>breathing as a magical, life-giving act and used it, accordingly, as a magical vehicle; the </p>
 <p>exhalation, to eject the foreign energy left in them during the interaction being </p>
 <p>recapitulated and the inhalation to pull back the energy that they themselves left behind </p>
 <p>during the interaction.</p>
 <p>Because of my academic training, I took the recapitulation to be the process of analyzing </p>
 <p>one's life. But don Juan insisted that it was more involved than an intellectual </p>
 <p>psychoanalysis. He postulated the recapitulation as a sorcerer's ploy to induce a minute </p>
 <p>but steady displacement of the assemblage point. He said that the assemblage point, </p>
 <p>under the impact of reviewing past actions and feelings, goes back and forth between its </p>
 <p>present site and the site it occupied when the event being recapitulated took place.</p>
 <p>Don Juan stated that the old sorcerers' rationale behind the recapitulation was their </p>
 <p>conviction that there is an inconceivable dissolving force in the universe, which makes </p>
 <p>organisms live by lending them awareness. That force also makes organisms die, in order </p>
 <p>to extract the same lent awareness, which organisms have enhanced through their life </p>
 <p>experiences. Don Juan explained the old sorcerers' reasoning. They believed that since it </p>
 <p>is our life experience this force is after, it is of supreme importance that it can be satisfied </p>
 <p>with a facsimile of our life experience: the recapitulation. Having had what it seeks, the </p>
 <p>dissolving force then lets sorcerers go, free to expand their capacity to perceive and reach </p>
 <p>with it the confines of time and space.</p>
 <p>When I started again to recapitulate, it was a great surprise to me that my dreaming </p>
 <p>practices were automatically suspended the moment my recapitulation began. I asked don </p>
 <p>Juan about this unwanted recess.</p>
 <p>"Dreaming requires every bit of our available energy," he replied. "If there is a deep </p>
 <p>preoccupation in our life, there is no possibility of dreaming."</p>
 <p>"But I have been deeply preoccupied before," I said, "and my practices were never </p>
 <p>interrupted."</p>
 <p>"It must be then that every time you thought you were preoccupied, you were only </p>
 <p>egomaniacally disturbed," he said, laughing. "To be preoccupied, for sorcerers, means </p>
 <p>that all your energy sources are taken on. This is the first time you've engaged your </p>
 <p>energy sources in their totality The rest of the time, even when you recapitulated before, </p>
 <p>you were not completely absorbed."</p>
 <p>Don Juan gave me this time a new recapitulation pattern. I was supposed to construct a </p>
 <p>jigsaw puzzle by recapitulating, without any apparent order, different events of my life.</p>
 <p>"But it's going to be a mess," I protested.</p>
 <p>"No, it won't be," he assured me. "It'll be a mess if you let your pettiness choose the </p>
 <p>events you are going to recapitulate. Instead, let the spirit decide. Be silent, and then get </p>
 <p>to the event the spirit points out."</p>
 <p>The results of that pattern of recapitulation were shocking to me on many levels. It was </p>
 <p>very impressive to find out that, whenever I silenced my mind, a seemingly independent </p>
 <p>force immediately plunged me into a most detailed memory of some event in my life. But </p>
 <p>it was even more impressive that a very orderly configuration resulted. What I thought </p>
 <p>was going to be chaotic turned out to be extremely effective.</p>
 <p>I asked don Juan why he had not made me recapitulate in this manner from the start. He </p>
 <p>replied that there are two basic rounds to the recapitulation, that the first is called </p>
 <p>formality and rigidity, and the second fluidity</p>
 <p>I had no inkling about how different my recapitulation was going to be this time. The </p>
 <p>ability to concentrate, which I had acquired by means of my dreaming practices, </p>
 <p>permitted me to examine my life at a depth I would never have imagined possible. It took </p>
 <p>me over a year to view and review all I could about my life experiences. At the end, I had </p>
 <p>to agree with don Juan:</p>
 <p>there had been immensities of loaded emotions hidden so deeply inside me as to be </p>
 <p>virtually inaccessible.</p>
 <p>The result of my second recapitulation was a new, more relaxed attitude. The very day I </p>
 <p>returned to my dreaming practices, I dreamt I saw myself asleep. I turned around and </p>
 <p>daringly left my room, penuriously going down a flight of stairs to the street.</p>
 <p>I was elated with what I had done and reported it to don Juan. My disappointment was </p>
 <p>enormous when he did not consider this dream part of my dreaming practices. He argued </p>
 <p>that I had not gone to the street with my energy body, because if I had I would have had a </p>
 <p>sensation other than walking down a flight of stairs.</p>
 <p>"What kind of sensation are you talking about, don Juan?" I asked, with genuine curiosity</p>
 <p>"You have to establish some valid guide to find out whether you are actually seeing your </p>
 <p>body asleep in your bed," he said instead of answering my question. "Remember, you </p>
 <p>must be in your actual room, seeing your actual body. Otherwise, what you are having is </p>
 <p>merely a dream. If that's the case, control that dream, either by observing its detail or by </p>
 <p>changing it."</p>
 <p>I insisted he tell me more about the valid guide he had referred to, but he cut me short. </p>
 <p>"Figure out a way to validate the fact that you are looking at yourself," he said.</p>
 <p>"Do you have any suggestions as to what can be a valid guide?" I insisted.</p>
 <p>"Use your own judgment. We are coming to the end of our time together. You have to be </p>
 <p>on your own very soon."</p>
 <p>He changed the subject then, and I was left with a clear taste of my ineptitude. I was </p>
 <p>unable to figure out what he wanted or what he meant by a valid guide.</p>
 <p>In the next dream in which I saw myself asleep, instead of leaving the room and walking </p>
 <p>down the stairs, or waking up screaming, I remained glued, for a long time, to the spot </p>
 <p>from which I watched. Without fretting or despairing, I observed the details of my dream. </p>
 <p>I noticed then that I was asleep wearing a white T-shirt that was ripped at the shoulder. I </p>
 <p>tried to come closer and examine the rip, but moving was beyond my capabilities. I felt a </p>
 <p>heaviness that seemed to be part of my very being. In fact, I was all weight. Not knowing </p>
 <p>what to do next, I instantly entered into a devastating confusion. I tried to change dreams, </p>
 <p>but some unaccustomed force kept me staring at m sleeping body.</p>
 <p>In the midst of my turmoil, I heard the dreaming emissary saying that not having control </p>
 <p>to move around was frightening me to the point that I might have to do another </p>
 <p>recapitulation. The emissary's voice and what it said did not surprise me at all. I had </p>
 <p>never felt so vividly and terrifyingly unable to move. I did not, however, give in to my </p>
 <p>terror. I examined it and found out that it was not a psychological terror but a physical </p>
 <p>sensation of helplessness, despair, and annoyance. It bothered me beyond words that I </p>
 <p>was not capable of moving my limbs. My annoyance grew in proportion to my realization </p>
 <p>that some thing outside me had me brutally pinned down. The effort I made to move my </p>
 <p>arms or legs was so intense and single-minded that at one moment I actually saw one leg </p>
 <p>of my body, sleeping on the bed, flung out as if kicking.</p>
 <p>My awareness was then pulled into my inert, sleeping body, and I woke up with such a </p>
 <p>force that it took more than half an hour to calm myself down. My heart was beating </p>
 <p>almost erratically. I was shivering, and some of the muscles in my legs twitched </p>
 <p>uncontrollably. I had suffered such a radical loss of body heat that I needed blankets and </p>
 <p>hot-water bottles to raise my temperature.</p>
 <p>Naturally, I went to Mexico to ask don Juan's advice about the sensation of paralysis, and </p>
 <p>about the fact that I really had been wearing a ripped T-shirt, thus, I had indeed seen </p>
 <p>myself asleep. Besides, I was deadly afraid of hypothermia. He was reluctant to discuss </p>
 <p>my predicament. All I got out of him was a caustic remark.</p>
 <p>"You like drama," he said flatly. "Of course you really saw yourself asleep. The problem </p>
 <p>is that you got nervous, because your energy body has never been consciously in one </p>
 <p>piece before. If you ever get nervous and cold again, hold on to your dick. That will </p>
 <p>restore your body temperature in a jiffy and without any fuss."</p>
 <p>I felt a bit offended by his crassness. However, the advice proved effective. The next time </p>
 <p>I became frightened, I relaxed and returned to normal in a few minutes, doing what he </p>
 <p>had prescribed. In this manner, I discovered that if I did not fret and kept my annoyance </p>
 <p>in check, I did not panic. To remain controlled did not help me move, but it certainly </p>
 <p>gave me a deep sensation of peace and serenity</p>
 <p>After months of useless efforts at walking, I sought don Juan's comments once again, not </p>
 <p>so much for his advice this time but because I wanted to concede defeat. I was up against </p>
 <p>an impassable barrier, and I knew with indisputable certainty that I had failed.</p>
 <p>"Dreamers have to be imaginative," don Juan said with a malicious grin. "Imaginative </p>
 <p>you are not. I didn't warn you about having to use your imagination to move your energy </p>
 <p>body because I wanted to find out whether you could resolve the riddle by yourself. You </p>
 <p>didn't, and your friends didn't help you either."</p>
 <p>In the past, I had been driven to defend myself viciously whenever he accused me of </p>
 <p>lacking imagination. I thought I was imaginative, but having don Juan as a teacher had </p>
 <p>taught me, the hard way, that I am not. Since I was not going to engage my energy in </p>
 <p>futile defenses of myself, I asked him instead, "What is this riddle you are talking about, </p>
 <p>don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"The riddle of how impossible and yet how easy it is to move the energy body. You are </p>
 <p>trying to move it as if you were in the daily world. We spend so much time and effort </p>
 <p>learning to walk that we believe our dreaming bodies should also walk. There is no </p>
 <p>reason why they should, except that walking is foremost in our minds."</p>
 <p>I marveled at the simplicity of the solution. I instantly knew that don Juan was right. I </p>
 <p>had gotten stuck again at the level of interpretation. He had told me I had to move around </p>
 <p>once I reached the third gate of dreaming, and to me moving around meant walking. I </p>
 <p>told him that I understood his point.</p>
 <p>"It isn't my point," he curtly answered. "It's a sorcerers' point. Sorcerers say that at the </p>
 <p>third gate the entire energy body can move like energy moves: fast and directly. Your </p>
 <p>energy body knows exactly how to move. It can move as it moves in the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings' world.</p>
 <p>"And this brings us to the other issue here," don Juan added with an air of pensiveness. </p>
 <p>"Why didn't your inorganic being friends help you?"</p>
 <p>"Why do you call them my friends, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"They are like the classic friends who are not really thoughtful or kind to us but not mean </p>
 <p>either. The friends who are just waiting for us to turn our backs so they can stab us there."</p>
 <p>I understood him completely and agreed with him one hundred percent.</p>
 <p>"What makes me go there? Is it a suicidal tendency?" I asked him, more rhetorically than </p>
 <p>not.</p>
 <p>"You don't have any suicidal tendency" he said. "What you have is a total disbelief that </p>
 <p>you were near death. Since you were not in physical pain, you can't quite convince </p>
 <p>yourself you were in mortal danger."</p>
 <p>His argument was most reasonable, except that I did believe a deep, unknown fear had </p>
 <p>been ruling my life since my bout with the inorganic beings. Don Juan listened in silence </p>
 <p>as I described to him my predicament. I could not discard or explain away my urge to go </p>
 <p>to the inorganic beings' world, in spite of what I knew about it.</p>
 <p>"I have a streak of insanity," I said. "What I do doesn't make sense."</p>
 <p>"It does make sense. The inorganic beings are still reeling YOU in, like a fish hooked at </p>
 <p>the end of a line," he said. "They throw worthless bait at you from time to time to keep </p>
 <p>you going. To arrange your dreams to occur every four days with out fail is worthless </p>
 <p>bait. But they didn't teach you how to move your energy body."</p>
 <p>"Why do you think they didn't?"</p>
 <p>"Because when your energy body learns to move by itself, you'll be thoroughly out of </p>
 <p>their reach. It was premature of me to believe that you are free from them. You are </p>
 <p>relatively but not completely free. They are still bidding for your awareness."</p>
 <p>I felt a chill in my back. He had touched a sore spot in me. "Tell me what to do, don Juan, </p>
 <p>and I'll do it," I said.</p>
 <p>"Be impeccable. I have told you this dozens of times. To be impeccable means to put </p>
 <p>your life on the line in order to back up your decisions, and then to do quite a lot more </p>
 <p>than your best to realize those decisions. When you are not deciding any thing, you are </p>
 <p>merely playing roulette with your life in a helter-skelter way."</p>
 <p>Don Juan ended our conversation, urging me to ponder what he had said.</p>
 <p>At the first opportunity I had, I put don Juan's suggestion about moving my energy body </p>
 <p>to the test. When I found myself looking at my body asleep, instead of struggling to walk </p>
 <p>toward it I simply willed myself to move closer to the bed. Instantly, I was nearly </p>
 <p>touching my body. I saw my face. In fact, I could see every pore in my skin. I cannot say </p>
 <p>that I liked what I saw. My view of my own body was too detailed to be aesthetically </p>
 <p>pleasing. Then something like a wind came into the room, totally disarranged everything, </p>
 <p>and erased my view.</p>
 <p>During subsequent dreams, I entirely corroborated that the only way the energy body can </p>
 <p>move is to glide or soar. I discussed this with don Juan. He seemed unusually satisfied </p>
 <p>with what I had done, which certainly surprised me. I was accustomed to his cold </p>
 <p>reaction to anything I did in my dreaming practices.</p>
 <p>"Your energy body is used to moving only when something pulls it," he said. "The </p>
 <p>inorganic beings have been pulling your energy body right and left, and until now you </p>
 <p>have never moved it by yourself, with your own volition. It doesn't seem like you've </p>
 <p>done much, moving the way you did, yet I assure you that I was seriously considering </p>
 <p>ending your practices. For a while, I believed you were not going to learn how to move </p>
 <p>on your own."</p>
 <p>"Were you considering ending my dreaming practices because I am slow?"</p>
 <p>"You're not slow. It takes sorcerers forever to learn to move the energy body. I was going </p>
 <p>to end your dreaming practices because I have no more time. There are other topics, more </p>
 <p>pressing than dreaming, on which you can use your energy."</p>
 <p>"Now that I've learned how to move my energy body by myself, what else should I do, </p>
 <p>don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Continue moving. Moving your energy body has opened up a new area for you, an area </p>
 <p>of extraordinary exploration."</p>
 <p>He urged me again to come up with an idea to validate the faithfulness of my dreams; </p>
 <p>that request did not seem as odd as it had the first time he voiced it.</p>
 <p>"As you know, to be transported by a scout is the real dreaming task of the second gate," </p>
 <p>he explained. "It is a very serious matter, but not as serious as forging and moving the </p>
 <p>energy body. Therefore, you have to make sure, by some means of your own, whether </p>
 <p>you are actually seeing yourself asleep or whether you are merely dreaming that you're </p>
 <p>seeing yourself asleep. Your new extraordinary exploration hinges on really seeing </p>
 <p>yourself asleep."</p>
 <p>After some heavy pondering and wondering, I believed that I had come up with the right </p>
 <p>plan. Having seen my ripped T-shirt gave me an idea for a valid guide. I started from the </p>
 <p>assumption that, if I were actually observing myself asleep, I would also be observing </p>
 <p>whether I had the same sleeping attire I had gone to bed in, an attire that I had decided to </p>
 <p>change radically every four days. I was confident that I was not going to have any </p>
 <p>difficulty in remembering, in dreams, what I was wearing when I went to bed; the </p>
 <p>discipline I had acquired through my dreaming practices made me think that I had the </p>
 <p>ability to record things like this in my mind and remember them in dreams.</p>
 <p>I engaged my best efforts to follow this guide, but the results did not pan out as I thought </p>
 <p>they would, I lacked the necessary control over my dreaming attention, and I could not </p>
 <p>quite remember the details of my sleeping attire. Yet something else was definitely at </p>
 <p>work; somehow I always knew whether my dreams were ordinary dreams or not. The out </p>
 <p>standing aspect of the dreams that were not just ordinary dreams was that my body lay </p>
 <p>asleep in bed while my consciousness observed it.</p>
 <p>A notable feature of these dreams was my room. It was never like my room in the daily </p>
 <p>world but an enormous empty hall with my bed at one end. I used to soar over a </p>
 <p>considerable distance to be at the side of the bed where my body lay. The moment I was </p>
 <p>next to it, a windlike force used to make me hover over it, like a hummingbird. At times </p>
 <p>the room used to vanish; disappear piece by piece until only my body and the bed were </p>
 <p>left. At other times, I used to experience a complete loss of volition. My dreaming </p>
 <p>attention seemed then to function independently of me. Either it was completely absorbed </p>
 <p>by the first item it encountered in the room or it seemed unable to decide what to do. In </p>
 <p>those instances, I had the sensation that I was helplessly floating, going from item to </p>
 <p>item.</p>
 <p>The, voice of the dreaming emissary explained to me once that all the elements of the </p>
 <p>dreams, which were not just commonplace dreams, were really energy configurations </p>
 <p>different from those of our normal world. The emissary's voice pointed out that, for </p>
 <p>example, the walls were liquid. It urged me then to plunge into one of them.</p>
 <p>Without thinking twice, I dived into a wall as if I were diving into a huge lake. I did not </p>
 <p>feel the waterlike wall; what I felt was not a physical sensation of plunging into a body of </p>
 <p>water either. It was more like the thought of diving and the visual sensation of going </p>
 <p>through liquid matter. I was going, head first, into something that opened up, like water </p>
 <p>does, as I kept moving downward.</p>
 <p>The sensation of going down, headfirst, was so real that I began to wonder how long or </p>
 <p>how deep or how far I was diving. From my point of view, I spent an eternity in there. I </p>
 <p>saw clouds and rocklike masses of matter suspended in a waterlike substance. There were </p>
 <p>some glowing, geometric objects that resembled crystals, and blobs of the deepest </p>
 <p>primary colors I had ever seen. There were also zones of intense light and others of pitch </p>
 <p>blackness. Everything went by me, either slowly or at a fast speed. I had the thought that </p>
 <p>I was viewing the cosmos. At, the instant of that thought, my speed increased so </p>
 <p>immensely that everything became blurred, and all of a sudden, I found myself awake </p>
 <p>with my nose smack against the wall of my room.</p>
 <p>Some hidden fear urged me to consult with don Juan. He listened to me, hanging on </p>
 <p>every word.</p>
 <p>"You need to do some drastic maneuvering at this point," he said. "The dreaming </p>
 <p>emissary has no business interfering with your dreaming practices. Or rather, you should </p>
 <p>not, under any conditions, permit it to do so."</p>
 <p>"How can I stop it?"</p>
 <p>"Perform a simple but difficult maneuver. Upon entering into dreaming, voice out loud </p>
 <p>your desire not to have the dreaming emissary anymore."</p>
 <p> "Does that mean, don Juan, that I will never hear it again?"</p>
 <p>"Positively. You'll get rid of it forever."</p>
 <p>"But is it advisable to get rid of it forever?"</p>
 <p>"It most certainly is, at this point."</p>
 <p>With those words, don Juan involved me in a most disturbing dilemma. I did not want to </p>
 <p>put an end to my relationship with the emissary, but, at the same time, I wanted to follow </p>
 <p>don Juan's advice. He noticed my hesitation.</p>
 <p>"I know it's a very difficult affair," he conceded, "but if you don't do it, the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings will always have a line on you. If you want to avoid this, do what I said, and do it </p>
 <p>now."</p>
 <p>During my next dreaming session, as I prepared myself to utter my intent, the emissary's </p>
 <p>voice interrupted me. It said, "If you refrain from stating your request, I promise you </p>
 <p>never to interfere with your dreaming practices and talk to you only if you ask me direct </p>
 <p>questions."</p>
 <p>I instantly accepted its proposition and sincerely felt that it was a good deal. I was even </p>
 <p>relieved it had turned out this way. I was afraid, however, that don Juan was going to be </p>
 <p>disappointed.</p>
 <p>"It was a good maneuver," he remarked and laughed. "You were sincere; you really </p>
 <p>intended to voice your request. To be sincere is all that was required. There was, </p>
 <p>essentially, no need for you to eliminate the emissary. What you wanted was to corner it </p>
 <p>into proposing an alternative way, convenient to you. I am sure the emissary won't </p>
 <p>interfere anymore."</p>
 <p>He was right. I continued my dreaming practices without any meddling from the emissary </p>
 <p>The remarkable consequence was that I began to have dreams in which my dream rooms </p>
 <p>were my room in the daily world, with one difference: in the dreams, my room was </p>
 <p>always so slanted, so distorted that it looked like a giant cubist painting; obtuse and acute </p>
 <p>angles were the rule instead of the normal right angles of walls, ceiling, and floor. In my </p>
 <p>lopsided room, the very slant, created by the acute or obtuse angles, was a device to </p>
 <p>display prominently some absurd, superfluous, but real detail; for example, intricate lines </p>
 <p>in the hardwood floor, or weather discolorations in the wall paint, or dust spots on the </p>
 <p>ceiling, or smudged finger prints on the edge of a door.</p>
 <p>In those dreams, I unavoidably got lost in the waterlike universes of the detail pointed out </p>
 <p>by the slant. During my entire dreaming practices, the profusion of detail in my room was </p>
 <p>so immense and its pull so intense that it instantly made me dive into it.</p>
 <p>At the first free moment I had, I was at don Juan's place, consulting him about this state. </p>
 <p>"I can't overcome my room," I said to him after I had given him the details of my </p>
 <p>dreaming practices.</p>
 <p>"What gives you the idea you have to overcome it?" he; asked with a grin.</p>
 <p>"I feel that I have to move beyond my room, don Juan."</p>
 <p>"But you are moving beyond your room. Perhaps you should ask yourself whether you </p>
 <p>are caught again in interpretations. What do you think moving means in this case?"</p>
 <p>I told him walking from my room to the street had been such a haunting dream for me </p>
 <p>that I felt a real need to do it again.</p>
 <p>"But you are doing greater things than that," he protested. "You are going to unbelievable </p>
 <p>regions. What else do you want?"</p>
 <p>I tried to explain to him that I had a physical urge to move away from the trap of detail. </p>
 <p>What upset me the most was my incapacity to free myself from whatever caught my </p>
 <p>attention. To have a modicum of volition was the bottom line for me.</p>
 <p>A very long silence followed. I waited to hear more about the trap of detail. After all, he </p>
 <p>had warned me about its dangers. "You are doing fine," he finally said. "Dreamers take a </p>
 <p>very long time to perfect their energy bodies. And this is exactly what's at stake here: </p>
 <p>perfecting your energy body."</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that the reason my energy body was compelled to examine detail and </p>
 <p>get inextricably stuck in it was its inexperience, its incompleteness. He said that sorcerers </p>
 <p>spend a lifetime consolidating the energy body by letting it sponge up everything </p>
 <p>possible.</p>
 <p>"Until the energy body is complete and mature, it is self- absorbed," don Juan went on. </p>
 <p>"It can't get free from the compulsion to be absorbed by everything. But if one takes this </p>
 <p>into consideration, instead of fighting the energy body, as you're doing now, one can lend </p>
 <p>it a hand."</p>
 <p>"How can I do that, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"By directing its behavior, that is to say, by stalking it."</p>
 <p>He explained that since everything related to the energy body depends on the appropriate </p>
 <p>position of the assemblage point, and since dreaming is nothing else but the means to </p>
 <p>displace it, stalking is, consequently, the way to make the assemblage point stay put on </p>
 <p>the perfect position, in this case, the position where the energy body can become </p>
 <p>consolidated and from which it can finally emerge.</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that the moment the energy body can move on its own, sorcerers assume </p>
 <p>that the optimum position of the assemblage point has been reached. The next step is to </p>
 <p>stalk it, that is, to fixate it on that position in order to complete the energy body. He </p>
 <p>remarked that the procedure is simplicity itself. One intends to stalk it.</p>
 <p>Silence and looks of expectation followed that statement. I expected him to say more, and </p>
 <p>he expected me to have under stood what he had said. I had not.</p>
 <p>"Let your energy body intend to reach the optimum dreaming position," he explained. </p>
 <p>"Then, let your energy body intend to stay at that position and you will be stalking."</p>
 <p>He paused and, with his eyes, urged me to consider his statement. "Intending is the </p>
 <p>secret, but you already know that," he said. "Sorcerers displace their assemblage points </p>
 <p>through intending and fixate them, equally, through intending. And there is no technique </p>
 <p>for intending. One intends through Usage."</p>
 <p>To have another of my wild assumptions about my worth as a sorcerer was unavoidable </p>
 <p>at that point. I had boundless confidence that something was going to put me on the right </p>
 <p>track to intend the fixation of my assemblage point on the ideal spot. I, had accomplished </p>
 <p>in the past all kinds of successful maneuvers without knowing how I performed them. </p>
 <p>Don Juan himself had marveled at my ability or my luck, and I was sure this was going to </p>
 <p>be one of those instances. I was gravely mistaken. No matter what I did, or how long I </p>
 <p>waited, I had no success whatsoever in fixing my assemblage point on any spot, much </p>
 <p>less on the ideal one.</p>
 <p>After months of serious but unsuccessful struggling, I gave up. "I really believed I could </p>
 <p>do it," I said to don Juan, the moment I was in his house. "I am afraid that nowadays I am </p>
 <p>more of an egomaniac than ever."</p>
 <p>"Not really," he said with a smile. "What happens is that you are caught in another of </p>
 <p>your routinary misinterpretations of terms. You want to find the ideal spot, as if you were </p>
 <p>finding your lost car keys. Then you want to tie your assemblage point, as if you were </p>
 <p>tying your shoes. The ideal spot and the fixation of the assemblage point are metaphors. </p>
 <p>They have nothing to do with the words used to describe them."</p>
 <p>He asked me then to tell him the latest events of any dreaming practices. The first thing I </p>
 <p>mentioned was that my urge to be absorbed by detail had subsided notably. I said that </p>
 <p>perhaps because I moved in my dreams, compulsively, and incessantly, the movement </p>
 <p>might have been what always managed to stop me before I plunged into the detail I was </p>
 <p>observing. To be stopped in that fashion gave me the opportunity to examine the act of </p>
 <p>being absorbed by detail. I came; to the conclusion that inanimate matter actually </p>
 <p>possesses an immobilizing force, which I saw as a beam of dull light that kept me pinned </p>
 <p>down. For example, many times some minute mark on the walls or in the wood lines of </p>
 <p>the hard wood floor of my room used to send a line of light that trans fixed me; from the </p>
 <p>moment my dreaming attention was focused on that light, the whole dream rotated </p>
 <p>around that minute mark. I saw it enlarged perhaps to the size of the cosmos. That view </p>
 <p>used to last until I woke up, usually with my nose pressed against the wall or the wood </p>
 <p>floor. My own observations were that, in the first place, the detail was real, and, in the </p>
 <p>second place, I seemed to have been observing it while I was asleep.</p>
 <p>Don Juan smiled and said, "All this is happening to you because the forging of your </p>
 <p>energy body was completed the moment it moved by itself. I didn't tell you that, but I </p>
 <p>insinuated it. I wanted to know whether or not you were capable of finding it out by </p>
 <p>yourself, which, of course, you did."</p>
 <p>I had no idea what he meant. Don Juan scrutinized me in his usual manner. His </p>
 <p>penetrating gaze scanned my body.</p>
 <p>"What exactly did I find out by myself, don Juan?" I was forced to ask.</p>
 <p>"You found out that your energy body had been completed," he answered.</p>
 <p>"I didn't find out anything of the kind, I assure you."</p>
 <p>"Yes, you did. It started some time ago, when you couldn't find a guide to validate the </p>
 <p>realness of your dreams, but then something went to work for you and let you know </p>
 <p>whether you were having a regular dream. That something was your energy body. Now, </p>
 <p>you despair that you couldn't find the ideal spot to fix your assemblage point. And I tell </p>
 <p>you that you did. The proof is that, by moving around, your energy body curtailed its </p>
 <p>obsession with detail."</p>
 <p>I was nonplussed. I could not even ask one of my feeble questions.</p>
 <p>"What comes next for you is a sorcerers' gem," don Juan went on. "You are going to </p>
 <p>practice seeing energy, in your dreaming. You have fulfilled the drill for the third gate of </p>
 <p>dreaming: moving your energy body by itself. Now you are going to perform the real </p>
 <p>task: seeing energy with your energy body.</p>
 <p>"You have seen energy before," he went on, "many times, in fact. But each of those </p>
 <p>times, seeing was a fluke. Now you are going to do it deliberately.</p>
 <p>"Dreamers have a rule of thumb," he continued. "If their energy body is complete, they </p>
 <p>see energy every time they gaze at an item in the daily world. In dreams, if they see the </p>
 <p>energy of an item, they know they are dealing with a real world, no matter how distorted </p>
 <p>that world may appear to their dreaming attention. If they can't see the energy of an item, </p>
 <p>they are in an ordinary dream and not in a real world."</p>
 <p>"What is a real world, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"A world that generates energy; the opposite of a phantom world of projections, where </p>
 <p>nothing generates energy, like most of our dreams, where nothing has an energetic </p>
 <p>effect."</p>
 <p>Don Juan then gave me another definition of dreaming: a process by which dreamers </p>
 <p>isolate dream conditions in which they can find energy-generating elements. He must </p>
 <p>have noticed my bewilderment. He laughed and gave another, even more convoluted </p>
 <p>definition: dreaming is the process by which we intend to find adequate positions of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point, positions that permit us to perceive energy-generating items in </p>
 <p>dreamlike states.</p>
 <p>He explained that the energy body is also capable of perceiving energy that is quite </p>
 <p>different from the energy of our own world, as in the case of items of the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings' realm, which the energy body perceives as sizzling energy. He added that in our </p>
 <p>world nothing sizzles; everything here wavers.</p>
 <p>"From now on," he said, "the issue of your dreaming is going to be to determine whether </p>
 <p>the items on which you focus your dreaming attention are energy generating, mere </p>
 <p>phantom projections, or generators of foreign energy."</p>
 <p>Don Juan admitted that he had hoped I was going to come up with the idea of seeing </p>
 <p>energy as the gauge to determine whether or not I was observing my real body asleep. He </p>
 <p>laughed at my spurious device of putting on elaborate sleeping attire, every four days. He </p>
 <p>said that I'd had, at my finger tips, all the information necessary to deduce what was the </p>
 <p>real task of the third gate of dreaming and to come up with the right idea but that my </p>
 <p>interpretation system had forced me to seek contrived solutions that lacked the simplicity </p>
 <p>and directness of sorcery.</p>
 <p>I</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 9</p>
 <p>THE NEW AREA OF EXPLORATION</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Don Juan told me that in order to see in dreaming not only did I have to intend seeing but </p>
 <p>I had to put my intent into loud words. For reasons he refused to explain, he insisted that I </p>
 <p>had to speak up. He conceded that there are other means to accomplish the same result, </p>
 <p>but he asserted that voicing one's intent is the simplest and most direct way.</p>
 <p>The first time I put into words my intent to see, I was dreaming of a church bazaar. There </p>
 <p>were so many articles that I could not make up my mind which one to gaze at. A giant, </p>
 <p>conspicuous vase in a corner made up my mind for me. I gazed at it, voicing my intent to </p>
 <p>see. The vase remained in my view for an instant, then it changed into another object. I </p>
 <p>gazed at as many things as I could in that dream. After I voiced my intent to see, every </p>
 <p>item I had chosen to gaze at vanished or turned into something else, as had happened all </p>
 <p>along in my dreaming practices. My dreaming attention was finally exhausted, and I </p>
 <p>woke up tremendously frustrated, almost angry.</p>
 <p>For months on end, I actually gazed at hundreds of items in my dreams and deliberately </p>
 <p>voiced my intent to see, but nothing ever happened. Tired of waiting, I finally had to ask </p>
 <p>don Juan about it.</p>
 <p>"You need to have patience. You are learning to do some thing extraordinary" he </p>
 <p>remarked. "You are learning to intend to see in your dreams. Someday you will not have </p>
 <p>to voice your intent; you'll simply will it, silently."</p>
 <p>"I think I have not understood the function of whatever I am doing," I said. "Nothing </p>
 <p>happens when I shout my intent to see. What does that mean?"</p>
 <p>"It means that your dreams, so far, have been ordinary dreams; they have been phantom </p>
 <p>projections; images that have life only in your dreaming attention."</p>
 <p>He wanted to know exactly what had happened to the items on which I had focused my </p>
 <p>gaze. I said that they had vanished or changed shape or even produced vortexes that </p>
 <p>eventually changed my dreams.</p>
 <p>"It has been like that in all my daily dreaming practices," I said. "The only thing out of </p>
 <p>the ordinary is that I am learning to yell in my dreams, at the top of my voice."</p>
 <p>My last statement threw don Juan into a genuine fit of belly laughter, which I found </p>
 <p>disconcerting. I failed to find the humor of my statement or the reason for his reaction.</p>
 <p>"Someday you'll appreciate how funny all this is," he said as an answer to my silent </p>
 <p>protest. "In the meantime, don't give up or get discouraged. Keep on trying. Sooner or </p>
 <p>later, you'll hit the right note."</p>
 <p>As usual, he was right. A couple of months later, I hit the jackpot. I had a most unusual </p>
 <p>dream. It started with the appearance of a scout from the inorganic beings' world. The </p>
 <p>scouts as well as the dreaming emissary had been strangely absent from my dreams. I had </p>
 <p>not missed them or pondered their disappearance. In fact, I was so at ease without them I </p>
 <p>had even forgotten to ask don Juan about their absence.</p>
 <p>In that dream, the scout had been, at first, a gigantic yellow topaz, which I had found </p>
 <p>stuck in the back of a drawer. The moment I voiced my intent to see, the topaz turned into </p>
 <p>a blob of sizzling energy. I feared that I would be compelled to follow it, so I moved my </p>
 <p>gaze away from the scout and focused it on an aquarium with tropical fish. I voiced my </p>
 <p>intent to see and got a tremendous surprise. The aquarium emitted a low, greenish glow </p>
 <p>and changed into a large surrealist portrait of a bejeweled woman. The portrait emitted </p>
 <p>the same greenish glow when I voiced my intent to see.</p>
 <p>As I gazed at that glow, the whole dream changed. I was walking then on a street in a </p>
 <p>town that seemed familiar to me; it might have been Tucson. I gazed at a display of </p>
 <p>women's clothes in a store window and spoke out loud my intent to see. Instantly, a black </p>
 <p>mannequin, prominently displayed, began to glow. I gazed next at a saleslady who came </p>
 <p>at that moment to rearrange the window. She looked at me. After voicing my intent, I saw </p>
 <p>her glow. It was so stupendous that I was afraid some detail in her splendorous glow </p>
 <p>would trap me, but the woman moved inside the store before I had time to focus my total </p>
 <p>attention on her. I certainly intended to follow her inside; however, my dreaming </p>
 <p>attention was caught by a moving glow. It came to me charging, filled with hatred. There </p>
 <p>was loathing in it and viciousness. I jumped backward. The glow stopped its charge; a </p>
 <p>black substance swallowed me, and I woke up.</p>
 <p>These images were so vivid that I firmly believed I had seen energy and my dream had </p>
 <p>been one of those conditions that don Juan had called dreamlike, energy-generating. The </p>
 <p>idea that dreams can take place in the consensual reality of our daily world intrigued me, </p>
 <p>just as the dream images of the inorganic beings' realm had intrigued me.</p>
 <p>"This time, you not only saw energy but crossed a dangerous boundary," don Juan said, </p>
 <p>after hearing my account.</p>
 <p>He reiterated that the drill for the third gate of dreaming is to make the energy body move </p>
 <p>on its own. In my last session, he said, I had unwittingly superseded the effect of that drill </p>
 <p>and crossed into another world.</p>
 <p>"Your energy body moved," he said. "It journeyed, by itself. That kind of journeying is </p>
 <p>beyond your abilities at this moment, and something attacked you."</p>
 <p>"What do you think it was, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"This is a predatorial universe. It could have been one of thousands of things existing out </p>
 <p>there."</p>
 <p>"Why do you think it attacked me?"</p>
 <p>"For the same reason the inorganic beings attacked you: because you made yourself </p>
 <p>available."</p>
 <p>"Is it that clear-cut, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Certainly. It's as clear-cut as what you would do if a strange-looking spider crept across </p>
 <p>your desk while you were writing. You'd squash it, out of fright, rather than admire it or </p>
 <p>examine it."</p>
 <p>I was at a loss and searched for words to ask the proper question. I wanted to ask him </p>
 <p>where my dream had taken place, or what world I was in in that dream. But those </p>
 <p>questions did not make any sense; I could gather that myself. Don Juan was very </p>
 <p>understanding.</p>
 <p>"You want to know where your dreaming attention was focused, don't you?" he asked </p>
 <p>with a grin.</p>
 <p>This was exactly how I wanted to word my question. I reasoned that in the dream under </p>
 <p>consideration, I must have been looking at some real object. Just like what had happened </p>
 <p>when I saw in dreams the minute details on the floor or the walls or the door of my room, </p>
 <p>details that I later had corroborated existed.</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that in special dreams, like the one I'd had, our dreaming attention focuses </p>
 <p>on the daily world, and that it moves instantly from one real object to another in the </p>
 <p>world. What makes this movement possible is that the assemblage point is on the proper </p>
 <p>dreaming position. From that position the assemblage point gives the dreaming attention </p>
 <p>such fluidity that it can move in a split second over incredible distances and in doing so it </p>
 <p>produces a perception so fast, so fleeting that it resembles an ordinary dream.</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that in my dream I had seen a real vase and then my dreaming </p>
 <p>attention had moved over distances to see a real surrealist painting of a bejeweled </p>
 <p>woman. The result, with the exception of seeing energy, had been very close to ordinary </p>
 <p>dream, in which items, when gazed at, quickly turn into something else.</p>
 <p>"I know how disturbing this is," he went on, definitely aware of my bewilderment. "For </p>
 <p>some reason pertinent to the mind, to see energy in dreaming is more upsetting than </p>
 <p>anything one can think of."</p>
 <p>I remarked that I had seen energy in dreaming before, yet it had never affected me like </p>
 <p>this.</p>
 <p>"Now your energy body is complete and functioning," he said. "Therefore, the </p>
 <p>implication that you see energy in your dream is that you are perceiving a real world, </p>
 <p>through the veil of a dream. That's the importance of the journey you took. It was real. It </p>
 <p>involved energy-generating items that nearly ended your life."</p>
 <p>"Was it that serious, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"You bet! The creature that attacked you was made of pure awareness and was as deadly </p>
 <p>as anything can be. You saw its energy. I am sure that you realize by now that unless we </p>
 <p>see in dreaming, we can't tell a real, energy-generating thing from a phantom projection. </p>
 <p>So, even though you battled the inorganic beings and indeed saw the scouts and the </p>
 <p>tunnels, your energy body doesn't know for sure if they were real, meaning energy </p>
 <p>generating. You are ninety-nine but not one hundred percent sure."</p>
 <p>Don Juan insisted on talking about the journey I had taken. For inexplicable reasons, I </p>
 <p>was reluctant to deal with that subject. What he was saying produced an instantaneous </p>
 <p>reaction in me. I found myself trying to come to grips with a deep, strange fear; it was </p>
 <p>dark and obsessive in a nagging, visceral way.</p>
 <p>"You definitely went into another layer of the onion," don Juan said, finishing a </p>
 <p>statement to which I had not paid attention.</p>
 <p>"What is this other layer of the onion, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"The world is like an onion, it has many skins. The world we know is but one of them. </p>
 <p>Sometimes, we cross boundaries and enter into another skin: another world, very much </p>
 <p>like this one, but not the same. And you entered into one, all by yourself."</p>
 <p>"How is this journey you're talking about possible, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"That is a meaningless question, because no one can answer it. In the view of sorcerers, </p>
 <p>the universe is constructed in layers, which the energy body can cross. Do you know </p>
 <p>where the old sorcerers are still existing to this day? In another layer, in another skin of </p>
 <p>the onion."</p>
 <p>"For me, the idea of a real, pragmatic journey, taken in dreams, is very difficult to </p>
 <p>understand or to accept, don Juan."</p>
 <p>"We have discussed this topic to exhaustion. I was convinced you understood that the </p>
 <p>journey of the energy body depends exclusively on the position of the assemblage point."</p>
 <p>"You've told me that. And I have been mulling it over and over; still, saying that the </p>
 <p>journey is in the position of the assemblage point doesn't say anything to me."</p>
 <p>"Your problem is your cynicism. I was just like you. Cynicism doesn't allow us to make </p>
 <p>drastic changes in our under standing of the world. It also forces us to feel that we are </p>
 <p>always right."</p>
 <p>I understood his point to perfection, but I reminded him about my fight against all that.</p>
 <p>"I propose that you do one nonsensical thing that might turn the tide," he said. "Repeat to </p>
 <p>yourself incessantly that the hinge of sorcery is the mystery of the assemblage point. If </p>
 <p>you repeat this to yourself long enough, some unseen force takes over and makes the </p>
 <p>appropriate changes in you."</p>
 <p>Don Juan did not give me any indication that he was being facetious. I knew he meant </p>
 <p>every word of it. What bothered me was his insistence that I repeat the formula </p>
 <p>ceaselessly to myself. I caught myself thinking that all of it was asinine.</p>
 <p>"Cut your cynical attitude," he snapped at me. "Repeat this in a bona fide manner.</p>
 <p>"The mystery of the assemblage point is everything in sorcery," he continued, without </p>
 <p>looking at me. "Or rather, everything in sorcery rests on the manipulation of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point. You know all this, but you have to repeat it."</p>
 <p>For an instant, as I heard his remarks, I thought I was going to die of anguish. An </p>
 <p>incredible sense of physical sadness gripped my chest and made me scream with pain. </p>
 <p>My stomach and diaphragm seemed to be pushing up, moving into my chest cavity The </p>
 <p>push was so intense that my awareness changed levels, and I entered into my normal </p>
 <p>state. Whatever we had been talking about became a vague thought about something that </p>
 <p>might have happened but actually had not, according to the mundane reasoning of my </p>
 <p>everyday-life consciousness.</p>
 <p>The next time don Juan and I talked about dreaming, we discussed the reasons I had been </p>
 <p>unable to proceed with my dreaming practices for months on end. Don Juan warned me </p>
 <p>that to explain my situation he had to go in a roundabout way. He pointed out, first, that </p>
 <p>there is an enormous difference between the thoughts and deeds of the men of antiquity </p>
 <p>and those of modern men. Then he pointed out that the men of ancient times had a very </p>
 <p>realistic view of perception and awareness because their view stemmed from their </p>
 <p>observations of the universe around them. Modern men, in contrast, have an absurdly </p>
 <p>unrealistic view of perception and awareness because their view stems from their </p>
 <p>observations of the social order and from their dealings with it.</p>
 <p>"Why are you telling me this?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Because you are a modern man involved with the views and observations of men of </p>
 <p>antiquity," he replied. "And none of those views and observations are familiar to you. </p>
 <p>Now more than ever you need sobriety and aplomb. I am trying to make a solid bridge, a </p>
 <p>bridge you can walk on, between the views of men of ancient times and those of modern </p>
 <p>men."</p>
 <p>He remarked that of all the transcendental observations of the men of ancient times, the </p>
 <p>only one with which I was familiar, because it had filtered down to our day, was the idea </p>
 <p>of selling our souls to the devil in exchange for immortality, which he admitted sounded </p>
 <p>to him like something coming straight out of the relationship of the old sorcerers with the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings. He reminded me how the dreaming emissary had tried to induce me to </p>
 <p>stay in its realm by offering me the possibility of maintaining my individuality and self-</p>
 <p>awareness for nearly an eternity.</p>
 <p>"As you know, succumbing to the lure of the inorganic beings is not just an idea; it's </p>
 <p>real," don Juan went on. "But you haven't yet fully realized the implication of that </p>
 <p>realness. Dreaming, likewise, is real; it is an energy-generating condition. You hear my </p>
 <p>statements and you certainly understand what I mean, but your awareness hasn't caught </p>
 <p>up with the total implication of it yet."</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that my rationality knew the import of a realization of this nature, and </p>
 <p>during our last talk it had forced my awareness to change levels. I ended up in my normal </p>
 <p>awareness before I could deal with the nuances of my dream. My rationality had further </p>
 <p>protected itself by suspending my dreaming practices.</p>
 <p>"I assure you that I am fully aware of what an energy-generating condition means," I </p>
 <p>said.</p>
 <p>"And I assure you that you are not," he retorted. "If you were, you would measure </p>
 <p>dreaming with greater care and deliberation. Since you believe you are just dreaming, </p>
 <p>you take blind chances. Your faulty reasoning tells you that no matter what happens, at a </p>
 <p>given moment the dream will be over and you will wake up."</p>
 <p>He was right. In spite of all the things I had witnessed in my dreaming practices, </p>
 <p>somehow I still retained the general sense, that all of it had been a dream.</p>
 <p>"I am talking to you about the views of men of antiquity and the views of modern man," </p>
 <p>don Juan went on, "because your awareness, which is the awareness of modern man, </p>
 <p>prefers to deal with an unfamiliar concept as if it were an empty ideality.</p>
 <p>"If I left it up to you, you'd regard dreaming as an idea. Of course, I'm sure you take </p>
 <p>dreaming seriously, but you don't quite believe in the reality of dreaming."</p>
 <p>"1 understand what you are saying, don Juan, but I don't understand why you are saying </p>
 <p>it."</p>
 <p>"I am saying all this because you are now, for the first time, in the proper position to </p>
 <p>understand that dreaming is an energy-generating condition. For the first time, you can </p>
 <p>understand now that ordinary dreams are the honing devices used to train the assemblage </p>
 <p>point to reach the position that creates this energy-generating condition we call </p>
 <p>dreaming."</p>
 <p>He warned me that, since dreamers touch and enter real worlds of all-inclusive effects, </p>
 <p>they ought to be in a permanent state of the most intense and sustained alertness; any </p>
 <p>deviation from total alertness imperils the dreamer in ways more than dreadful.</p>
 <p>I began again, at this point, to experience a movement in my chest cavity, exactly as I had </p>
 <p>felt the day my awareness changed levels by itself. Don Juan forcibly shook me by the </p>
 <p>arm.</p>
 <p>"Regard dreaming as something extremely dangerous!" he commanded me. "And begin </p>
 <p>that now! Don't start any of your weird maneuvers."</p>
 <p>His tone of voice was so urgent that I stopped whatever I was, unconsciously, doing.</p>
 <p>"What is going on with me, don Juan?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"What's going on with you is that you can displace your assemblage point quickly and </p>
 <p>easily," he said. "Yet that ease has the tendency to make the displacement erratic. Bring </p>
 <p>your ease to order. And don't allow yourself even a fraction of an inch leeway."</p>
 <p>I could easily have argued that I did not know what he was talking about, but I knew. I </p>
 <p>also knew I had only a few seconds to round up my energy and change my attitude, and I </p>
 <p>did.</p>
 <p>This was the end of our exchange that day. I went home, and for nearly a year I faithfully </p>
 <p>and daily repeated what don Juan had asked me to say. The results of my litany-like </p>
 <p>invocation were incredible. I was firmly convinced that it had the same effect on my </p>
 <p>awareness that exercise has on the muscles of the body. My assemblage point became. </p>
 <p>more agile, which meant that seeing energy in dreaming became the sole goal of my </p>
 <p>practices. My skill at intending to see grew in proportion to my efforts. A moment came </p>
 <p>when I was able just to intend seeing, without saying a word, and actually experience the </p>
 <p>same result as when I voiced out loud my intent to see.</p>
 <p>Don Juan congratulated me on my accomplishment. I, naturally, assumed he was being </p>
 <p>facetious. He assured me that he meant it, but beseeched me to continue shouting, at least </p>
 <p>when ever I was at a loss. His request did not seem odd to me. On my own, I had been </p>
 <p>yelling in my dreams at the top of my voice every time I deemed it necessary</p>
 <p>I discovered that the energy of our world wavers. It scintillates. Not only living beings </p>
 <p>but everything in our world glimmers with an inner light of its own. Don Juan explained </p>
 <p>that the energy of our world consists of layers of shimmering hues.</p>
 <p>The top layer is whitish; another, immediately adjacent to it, is chartreuse; and another </p>
 <p>one, more distant yet, is amber.</p>
 <p>I found all those hues, or rather I saw glimmers of them whenever items that I </p>
 <p>encountered in my dreamlike states changed shapes. However, a whitish glow was </p>
 <p>always the initial impact of seeing anything that generated energy.</p>
 <p>"Are there only three different hues?" I asked don Juan.</p>
 <p>"There is an endless number of them," he replied, "but for, the purposes of a beginning </p>
 <p>order, you should be concerned with those three. Later on, you can get as sophisticated as </p>
 <p>you want and isolate dozens of hues, if you are able to do it.</p>
 <p>"The whitish layer is the hue of the present position of mankind's assemblage point," don </p>
 <p>Juan continued. "Let's say that it is a modern hue. Sorcerers believe that everything man </p>
 <p>does nowadays is tinted with that whitish glow. At another time, the position of </p>
 <p>mankind's assemblage point made the hue of the ruling energy in the world chartreuse; </p>
 <p>and at another time, more distant yet, it made it amber. The color of sorcerers' energy is </p>
 <p>amber, which means that they are energetically associated with the men who existed in a </p>
 <p>distant past."</p>
 <p>"Do you think, don Juan, that the present whitish hue will change someday?"</p>
 <p>"If man is capable of evolving. The grand task of sorcerers is to bring forth the idea that, </p>
 <p>in order to evolve, man must first free his awareness from its bindings to the social order. </p>
 <p>Once aware ness is free, intent will redirect it into a new evolutionary path."</p>
 <p>"Do you think sorcerers will succeed in that task?"</p>
 <p>"They have already succeeded. They themselves are the proof. To convince others of the </p>
 <p>value and import of evolving is another matter."</p>
 <p>The other kind of energy I found present in our world but alien to it was the scouts' </p>
 <p>energy, the energy don Juan had called sizzling. I encountered scores of items in my </p>
 <p>dreams that, once I saw them, turned into blobs of energy that seemed to be frying, </p>
 <p>bubbling with some heatlike inner activity.</p>
 <p>"Bear in mind that not every scout you are going to find belongs to the realm of inorganic </p>
 <p>beings," don Juan remarked. "Every scout you have found so far, except for the blue </p>
 <p>scout, has been from that realm, but that was because the inorganic beings were catering </p>
 <p>to you. They were directing the show. Now you are on your own. Some of the scouts you </p>
 <p>will encounter are going to be not from the inorganic beings' realm but from other, even </p>
 <p>more distant levels of awareness."</p>
 <p>"Are the scouts aware of themselves?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Most certainly," he replied.</p>
 <p>"Then why don't they make contact with us when we are awake?"</p>
 <p>"They do. But our great misfortune is to have our consciousness so fully engaged that we </p>
 <p>don't have time to pay attention. In our sleep, however, the two-way-traffic trapdoor </p>
 <p>opens: we dream. And in our dreams, we make contact"</p>
 <p>"Is there any way to tell whether the scouts are from a level besides the inorganic beings' </p>
 <p>world?"</p>
 <p>"The greater their sizzling, the farther they come from. It sounds simplistic, but you have </p>
 <p>to let your energy body tell you what is what. I assure you, it'll make very fine </p>
 <p>distinctions and unerring judgments when faced with alien energy."</p>
 <p>He was right again. Without much ado, my energy body distinguished two general types </p>
 <p>of alien energy. The first was the scouts from the inorganic beings' realm. Their energy </p>
 <p>fizzled mildly. There was no sound to it, but it had all the overt appearance of </p>
 <p>effervescence, or of water that is starting to boil.</p>
 <p>The energy of the second general type of scouts gave me the impression of considerably </p>
 <p>more power. Those scouts seemed to be just about to burn. They vibrated from within as </p>
 <p>if they were filled with pressurized gas.</p>
 <p>My encounters with the alien energy were always fleeting because I paid total attention to </p>
 <p>what don Juan recommended. He said, "Unless you know exactly what you are doing and </p>
 <p>what you want out of alien energy, you have to be content with a brief glance. Anything </p>
 <p>beyond a glance is as dangerous and as stupid as petting a rattlesnake."</p>
 <p>"Why is it dangerous, don Juan?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Scouts are always very aggressive and extremely daring," he said. "They have to be that </p>
 <p>way in order to prevail in their explorations. Sustaining our dreaming attention on them is </p>
 <p>tantamount to soliciting their awareness to focus on us. Once they focus their attention on </p>
 <p>us, we are compelled to go with them. And that, of course, is the danger. We may end up </p>
 <p>in worlds beyond our energetic possibilities."</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that there are many more types of scouts than the two I had </p>
 <p>classified, but that at my present level of energy I could only focus on three. He described </p>
 <p>the first two types as the easiest to spot. Their disguises in our dreams are so outlandish, </p>
 <p>he said, that they immediately attract our dreaming attention. He depicted the scouts of </p>
 <p>the third type as the most dangerous, in terms of aggressiveness and power, and because </p>
 <p>they hide behind subtle disguises.</p>
 <p>"One of the strangest things dreamers find, which you yourself will find presently," don </p>
 <p>Juan continued, "is this third type of scout. So far, you have found samples of only the </p>
 <p>first two types, but that's because you haven't looked in the right place."</p>
 <p>"And what is the right place, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"You have again fallen prey to words; this time the culprit word is 'items,' which you </p>
 <p>have taken to mean only things, objects. Well, the most ferocious scout hides behind </p>
 <p>people in our dreams. A formidable surprise was in store for me, in my dreaming, when I </p>
 <p>focused my gaze on the dream image of my mother. After I voiced my intent to see, she </p>
 <p>turned into a ferocious, frightening bubble of sizzling energy."</p>
 <p>Don Juan paused to let his statements sink in. I felt stupid for being disturbed at the </p>
 <p>possibility of finding a scout behind the dream image of my mother.</p>
 <p>"It's annoying that they are always associated with the dream images of our parents or </p>
 <p>close friends," he went on.</p>
 <p>'Perhaps that's why we often feel ill at ease when we dream of them." His grin gave me </p>
 <p>the impression that he was enjoying my turmoil. "A rule of thumb for dreamers is to </p>
 <p>assume that the third type of scout is present whenever they feel perturbed by their </p>
 <p>parents or friends in a dream. Sound advice is to avoid those dream images. They are </p>
 <p>sheer poison."</p>
 <p>"Where does the blue scout stand in relation to the other scouts?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Blue energy doesn't sizzle," he replied. "It is like ours; it wavers, but it is blue instead of </p>
 <p>white. Blue energy doesn't exist in a natural state in our world.</p>
 <p>"And this brings us to something we've never talked about. What color were the scouts </p>
 <p>you've seen so far?"</p>
 <p>Until the moment he mentioned it, I had never thought about this. I told don Juan that the </p>
 <p>scouts I had seen were either pink or reddish. And he said that the deadly scouts of the </p>
 <p>third type were bright orange.</p>
 <p>I found out myself that the third type of scout is outright scary. Every time I found one of </p>
 <p>them, it was behind the dream images of my parents, especially of my mother. Seeing it </p>
 <p>always reminded me of the blob of energy that had attacked me in my first deliberate </p>
 <p>seeing dream. Every time I found it, the alien exploring energy actually seemed about to </p>
 <p>jump on me. My energy body used to react with horror even before I saw it.</p>
 <p>During our next discussion of dreaming, I queried don Juan about the total absence of </p>
 <p>inorganic beings in my dreaming practices. "Why don't they show up anymore?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"They only show themselves at the beginning," he explained. "After their scouts take us </p>
 <p>to their world, there is no necessity for the inorganic beings' projections. If we want to </p>
 <p>see the inorganic beings, a scout takes us there. For no one, and I mean no one, can </p>
 <p>journey by himself to their realm."</p>
 <p>"Why is that so, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Their world is sealed. No one can enter or leave without the consent of the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings. The only thing you can do by yourself once you are inside is, of course, voice </p>
 <p>your intent to stay. To say it out loud means to set in motion currents of energy that are </p>
 <p>irreversible. In olden times, words were incredibly powerful. Now they are not. In the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings' realm, they haven't lost their power."</p>
 <p>Don Juan laughed and said that he had no business saying anything about the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings' world because I really knew more about it than he and all his companions </p>
 <p>combined.</p>
 <p>"There is one last issue related to that world that we haven't discussed," he said. He </p>
 <p>paused for a long while, as if searching for the appropriate words. "In the final analysis," </p>
 <p>he began, "my aversion to the old sorcerers' activities is very personal. As a nagual, I </p>
 <p>detest what they did. They cowardly sought refuge in the inorganic beings' world. They </p>
 <p>argued that in a predatorial universe, poised to rip us apart, the only possible haven for us </p>
 <p>is in that realm."</p>
 <p>"Why did they believe that?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Because it's true," he said. "Since the inorganic beings can't lie, the sales pitch of the </p>
 <p>dreaming emissary is all true. That world can give us shelter and prolong our awareness </p>
 <p>for nearly an eternity."</p>
 <p>"The emissary's sales pitch, even if it's the truth, has no appeal to me," I said.</p>
 <p>"Do you mean you will chance a road that might rip you apart?" he asked with a note of </p>
 <p>bewilderment in his voice.</p>
 <p>I assured don Juan that I did not want the inorganic beings' world no matter what </p>
 <p>advantages it offered. My statement seemed to please him to no end.</p>
 <p>"You are ready then for one final statement about that world. The most dreadful </p>
 <p>statement I can make," he said, and tried to smile but did not quite make it.</p>
 <p>Don Juan searched in my eyes, I suppose for a glimmer of agreement or comprehension. </p>
 <p>He was silent for a moment.</p>
 <p>"The energy necessary to move the assemblage points of sorcerers comes from the realm </p>
 <p>of inorganic beings," he said, as if he were hurrying to get it over with.</p>
 <p>My heart nearly stopped. I felt a vertigo and had to stomp my feet on the ground not to </p>
 <p>faint.</p>
 <p>"This is the truth," don Juan went on, "and the legacy of the old sorcerers to us. They </p>
 <p>have us pinned down to this day. This is the reason I don't like them. I resent having to </p>
 <p>dip into one source alone. Personally, I refuse to do it. And I have tried to steer you away </p>
 <p>from it. But with no success, because something pulls you to that world, like a magnet."</p>
 <p>I understood don Juan better than I could have thought. Journeying to that world had </p>
 <p>always meant to me, at an energetic level, a boost of dark energy. I had even thought of it </p>
 <p>in those terms, long before don Juan voiced his statement.</p>
 <p>"What can we do about it?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"We can't have dealings with them," he answered, "and yet we can't stay away from </p>
 <p>them. My solution has been to take their energy but not give in to their influence. This is </p>
 <p>known as the ultimate stalking. It is done by sustaining the unbending intent of freedom, </p>
 <p>even though no sorcerer knows what freedom really is."</p>
 <p>"Can you explain to me, don Juan, why sorcerers have to take energy from the realm of </p>
 <p>inorganic beings?"</p>
 <p>"There is no other viable energy for sorcerers. In order to maneuver the assemblage point </p>
 <p>in the manner they do, sorcerers need an inordinate amount of energy."</p>
 <p>I reminded him of his own statement: that a redeployment of energy is necessary in order </p>
 <p>to do dreaming.</p>
 <p>"That is correct," he replied. "To start dreaming sorcerers need to redefine their premises </p>
 <p>and save their energy, but that redefining is valid only to have the necessary energy to set </p>
 <p>up dreaming. To fly into other realms, to see energy, to forge the energy body, et cetera, </p>
 <p>et cetera, is another matter. For those maneuvers, sorcerers need loads of dark, alien </p>
 <p>energy."</p>
 <p>"But how do they take it from the inorganic beings' world?"</p>
 <p>"By the mere act of going to that world. All the sorcerers our line have to do this. </p>
 <p>However, none of us is idiotic enough to do what you've done. But this is because none </p>
 <p>of us has your proclivities."</p>
 <p>Don Juan sent me home to ponder what he had revealed to me. I had endless questions, </p>
 <p>but he did not want to hear any of them.</p>
 <p>"All the questions you have, you can answer yourself," He said as he waved good-bye to </p>
 <p>me.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 10</p>
 <p>STALKING THE STALKERS</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>At home, I soon realized that it was impossible for me to answer any of my questions. In </p>
 <p>fact, I could not even formulate them. Perhaps that was because the boundary of the </p>
 <p>second attention had begun to collapse on me; this was when I met Florinda Grau and </p>
 <p>Carol Tiggs in the world of everyday life. The confusion of not knowing them at all yet </p>
 <p>knowing them so intimately that I would have died for them at the drop of a hat was most </p>
 <p>deleterious to me. I had met Taisha Abelar a few years before, and I was just beginning to </p>
 <p>get used to the confounded feeling of knowing her without having the vaguest idea of </p>
 <p>how. To add two more people to my overloaded system proved too much for me. I got ill </p>
 <p>out of fatigue and had to seek don Juan's aid. I went to the town in southern Mexico </p>
 <p>where he and his companions lived.</p>
 <p>Don Juan and his fellow sorcerers laughed uproariously at the mere mention of my </p>
 <p>turmoils. Don Juan explained to me that they were not really laughing at me but at </p>
 <p>themselves. My cognitive problems reminded them of the ones they had had, when the </p>
 <p>boundary of the second attention had collapsed on them, just as it had on me. Their </p>
 <p>awareness, like mine, had not been prepared for it, he said.</p>
 <p>"Every sorcerer goes through the same agony," don Juan went on. "Awareness is an </p>
 <p>endless area of exploration for sorcerers and man in general. In order to enhance </p>
 <p>awareness, there is no risk we should not run, no means we should refuse. Bear in mind, </p>
 <p>however, that only in soundness of mind can awareness be enhanced."</p>
 <p>Don Juan reiterated, then, that his time was coming to an end and that I had to use my </p>
 <p>resources wisely to cover as much. ground as I could before he left. Talk like that used to </p>
 <p>throw me into states of profound depression. But as the time of his departure approached; </p>
 <p>I had begun to react with more resignation. I no longer felt depressed, but I still panicked.</p>
 <p>Nothing else was said after that. The next day, at his request, I drove don Juan to Mexico </p>
 <p>City. We arrived around noon and went directly to the hotel del Prado, in the Paseo </p>
 <p>Alameda, the place he usually lodged when he was in the city. Don Juan had an </p>
 <p>appointment with a lawyer that day, at four in the after noon. Since we had plenty of </p>
 <p>time, we went to have lunch in the famous Caf&eacute; Tacuba, a restaurant in the heart of </p>
 <p>downtown where it was purported that real meals were served.</p>
 <p>Don Juan was not hungry. He ordered only two sweet tamales, while I gorged myself on </p>
 <p>a sumptuous feast. He laughed at me and made signs of silent despair at my healthy </p>
 <p>appetite.</p>
 <p>"I'm going to propose a line of action for you," he said in a curt tone when we had </p>
 <p>finished our lunch. "It's the last task of the third gate of dreaming, and it consists of </p>
 <p>stalking the stalkers, a most mysterious maneuver. To stalk the stalkers means to </p>
 <p>deliberately draw energy from the inorganic beings' realm in order to perform a sorcery </p>
 <p>feat.'</p>
 <p>"What kind of sorcery feat, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"A journey, a journey that uses awareness as an element of the environment," he </p>
 <p>explained. "In the world of daily life, water is an element of the environment that we use </p>
 <p>for traveling. Imagine awareness being a similar element that can be used for traveling. </p>
 <p>Through the medium of awareness, scouts from all over the universe come to us, and vice </p>
 <p>versa; via awareness, sorcerers go to the ends of the universe."</p>
 <p>There had been certain concepts, among the hosts of concepts don Juan had made me </p>
 <p>aware of in the course of his teachings, that attracted my full interest without any </p>
 <p>coaxing. This was one.</p>
 <p>"The idea that awareness is a physical element is revolutionary," I said in awe.</p>
 <p>"I didn't say it's a physical element," he corrected me. "It's an energetic element. You </p>
 <p>have to make that distinction. For sorcerers who see, awareness is a glow. They can hitch </p>
 <p>their energy body to that glow and go with it."</p>
 <p>"What's the difference between a physical and an energetic element?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"The difference is that physical elements are part of our interpretation system, but </p>
 <p>energetic elements are not. Energetic elements, like awareness, exist in our universe. But </p>
 <p>we, as average people, perceive only the physical elements because we were taught to do </p>
 <p>so. Sorcerers perceive the energetic elements for the same reason: they were taught to do </p>
 <p>so."</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that the use of awareness as an energetic element of our environment </p>
 <p>is the essence of sorcery, that in terms of practicalities, the trajectory of sorcery is, first, </p>
 <p>to free the existing energy in us by impeccably following the sorcerers' path; second, to </p>
 <p>use that energy to develop the energy body by means of dreaming; and, third, to use </p>
 <p>awareness as an element of the environment in order to enter with the energy body and all </p>
 <p>our physicality into other worlds.</p>
 <p>"There are two kinds of energy journeys into other worlds," he went on. "One is when </p>
 <p>awareness picks up the sorcerer's energy body and takes it wherever it may, and the other </p>
 <p>is when the sorcerer decides, in full consciousness, to use the avenue of awareness to </p>
 <p>make a journey. You've done the first kind of journeying. It takes an enormous discipline </p>
 <p>to do the second.</p>
 <p>After a long silence, don Juan stated that in the life of sorcerers there are issues that </p>
 <p>require masterful handling, and that dealing with awareness, as an energetic element open </p>
 <p>to the energy body, is the most important, vital, and dangerous of those issues.</p>
 <p>I had no comment. I was suddenly on pins and needles, hanging on every one of his </p>
 <p>words.</p>
 <p>"By yourself, you don't have enough energy to perform the last task of the third gate of </p>
 <p>dreaming," he went on, "but you and Carol Tiggs together can certainly do what I have in </p>
 <p>mind."</p>
 <p>He paused, deliberately egging me on with his silence to ask what he had in mind. I did. </p>
 <p>His laughter only increased the ominous mood.</p>
 <p>"I want you two to break the boundaries of the normal world and, using awareness as an </p>
 <p>energetic element, enter into another," he said. "This breaking and entering amounts to </p>
 <p>stalking the stalkers. Using awareness as an element of the environment bypasses the </p>
 <p>influence of the inorganic beings, but it still uses their energy."</p>
 <p>He did not want to give me any more information, in order not to influence me, he said. </p>
 <p>His belief was that the less I knew beforehand the better off I would be. I disagreed, but </p>
 <p>he assured me that, in a pinch, my energy body was perfectly capable of taking care of </p>
 <p>itself.</p>
 <p>We went from the restaurant to the lawyer's office. Don Juan quickly concluded his </p>
 <p>business, and we were, in no time at all, in a taxi on our way to the airport. Don Juan </p>
 <p>informed me that Carol Tiggs was arriving on a flight from Los Angeles, and that she </p>
 <p>was coming to Mexico City exclusively to fulfill this last dreaming task with me.</p>
 <p>"The valley of Mexico is a superb place to perform the kind of sorcery feat you are after," </p>
 <p>he commented.</p>
 <p>"You haven't told me yet what the exact steps to follow are," I said.</p>
 <p>He didn't answer me. We did not speak any more, but while we waited for the plane to </p>
 <p>land, he explained the procedure I had to follow. I had to go to Carol's room at the Regis </p>
 <p>Hotel, across the street from our hotel, and, after getting into a state of total inner silence, </p>
 <p>with her I had to slip gently into dreaming, voicing our intent to go to the realm of the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings.</p>
 <p>I interrupted to remind him that I always had to wait for a scout to show up before I could </p>
 <p>manifest out loud my intent to go to the inorganic beings' world.</p>
 <p>Don Juan chuckled and said, "You haven't dreamt with Carol Tiggs yet. You'll find out </p>
 <p>that it's a treat. Sorceresses don't need any props. They just go to that world whenever </p>
 <p>they want to; for them, there is a scout on permanent call."</p>
 <p>I could not bring myself to believe that a sorceress would be able to do what he was </p>
 <p>asserting. I thought I had a degree of expertise in handling the inorganic beings' world. </p>
 <p>When I mentioned to him what was going through my mind, he retorted that I had no </p>
 <p>expertise whatsoever when it came to what sorceresses are capable of.</p>
 <p>"Why do you think I had Carol Tiggs with me to pull you bodily out of that world?" he </p>
 <p>asked. "Do you think it was because she's beautiful?"</p>
 <p>"Why was it, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Because I couldn't do it myself; and for her, it was nothing. She has a knack for that </p>
 <p>world."</p>
 <p>"Is she an exceptional case, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Women in general have a natural bent for that realm; sorceresses are, of course, the </p>
 <p>champions, but Carol Tiggs is better than anyone I know because she, as the nagual </p>
 <p>woman, has superb energy."</p>
 <p>I thought I had caught don Juan in a serious contradiction. He had told me that the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings were not interested at all in women. Now he was asserting the opposite.</p>
 <p>"No. I'm not asserting the opposite," he remarked when I confronted him. "I've said to </p>
 <p>you that the inorganic beings don't pursue females; they only go after males. But I've </p>
 <p>also said to you that the inorganic beings are female, and that the entire universe is </p>
 <p>female to a large degree. So draw your own conclusions."</p>
 <p>Since I had no way to draw any conclusions, Don Juan explained to me that sorceresses, </p>
 <p>in theory, come and go as they please in that world because of their enhanced awareness </p>
 <p>and their femaleness.</p>
 <p>"Do you know this for a fact?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"The women of my party have never done that," he confessed, "not because they can't </p>
 <p>but because I dissuaded them. The women of your party, on the other hand, do it like </p>
 <p>changing skirts."</p>
 <p>I felt a vacuum in my stomach. I really did not know any thing about the women of my </p>
 <p>party. Don Juan consoled me, saying that my circumstances were different from his, as </p>
 <p>was my role as a nagual. He assured me that I did not have it in me to dissuade any of the </p>
 <p>women of my party even if I stood on my head.</p>
 <p>As the taxi drove us to her hotel, Carol delighted don Juan and me with her </p>
 <p>impersonations of people we knew. I tried to be serious and questioned her about our </p>
 <p>task. She mumbled some apologies for not being able to answer me with the seriousness I </p>
 <p>deserved. Don Juan laughed uproariously when she mimicked my solemn tone of voice.</p>
 <p>After registering Carol at the hotel, the three of us meandered around downtown, looking </p>
 <p>for secondhand bookstores. We ate a light dinner at the Sanborn's restaurant in the House </p>
 <p>of Tiles. About ten o'clock, we walked to the Regis Hotel. We went directly to the </p>
 <p>elevator. My fear had sharpened my capacity to perceive details. The hotel building was </p>
 <p>old and massive. The furniture in the lobby had obviously seen better days. Yet there was </p>
 <p>still, all around us, something left of an old glory that had a definite appeal. I could easily </p>
 <p>understand why Carol liked that hotel so much.</p>
 <p>Before we got into the elevator, my anxiety mounted to such heights that I had to ask don </p>
 <p>Juan for last-minute instructions. "Tell me again how we are going to proceed," I begged.</p>
 <p>Don Juan pulled us to the huge, ancient stuffed chairs in the lobby and patiently </p>
 <p>explained to us that, once we were in the world of the inorganic beings, we had to voice </p>
 <p>our intent to transfer our normal awareness to our energy bodies. He suggested that Carol </p>
 <p>and I voice our intent together, although that part was not really important What was </p>
 <p>important, he said, was that each of us intend the transfer of the total awareness of our </p>
 <p>daily world to our energy body.</p>
 <p>"How do we do this transference of awareness?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Transferring awareness is purely a matter of voicing our intent and having the necessary </p>
 <p>amount of energy he said. "Carol knows all this. She's done it before. She entered </p>
 <p>physically into the inorganic beings' world when she pulled you out of it, remember? Her </p>
 <p>energy will do the trick. It'll tip the scales."</p>
 <p>"What does it mean to tip the scales? I am in limbo, don Juan."</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that to tip the scales meant to add one's total physical mass to the </p>
 <p>energy body. He said that using awareness as a medium to make the journey into another </p>
 <p>world is not the result of applying any techniques but the corollary of intending and </p>
 <p>having enough energy. The bulk of energy from Carol Tiggs added to mine, or the bulk </p>
 <p>of my energy added to Carol's, was going to make us into one single entity energetically </p>
 <p>capable of pulling our physicality and placing it on the energy body in order to make that </p>
 <p>journey.</p>
 <p>"What exactly do we have to do in order to enter into that other world?" Carol asked. Her </p>
 <p>question scared me half to death; I thought she knew what was going on.</p>
 <p>"Your total physical mass has to be added to your energy body," don Juan replied, </p>
 <p>looking into her eyes. "The great difficulty of this maneuver is to discipline the energy </p>
 <p>body, a thing the two of you have already done. Lack of discipline is the only reason the </p>
 <p>two of you may fail in performing this feat of ultimate stalking. Sometimes, as a fluke, an </p>
 <p>average person ends up performing it and entering into another world. But this is </p>
 <p>immediately explained away as insanity or hallucination."</p>
 <p>I would have given anything in the world for don Juan to continue talking. But he put us </p>
 <p>in the elevator, and we went up to the second floor, to Carol's room, despite my protests </p>
 <p>and my rational need to know. Deep down, however, my turmoil was not so much that I </p>
 <p>needed to know; the bottom line was my fear. Somehow, this sorcerers' maneuver was </p>
 <p>more frightening to me than anything I had done so far.</p>
 <p>Don Juan's parting words to us were "Forget the self and you will fear nothing." His grin </p>
 <p>and the nodding of his head were invitations to ponder the statement.</p>
 <p>Carol laughed and began to clown,, imitating don Juan's voice as he gave us his cryptic </p>
 <p>instructions. Her lisping added quite a bit of color to what don Juan had said. Sometimes </p>
 <p>I found her lisping adorable. Most of the time, I detested it. Fortunately, that night her </p>
 <p>lisping was hardly noticeable.</p>
 <p>We went to her room and sat down on the edge of the bed. My last conscious thought was </p>
 <p>that the bed was a relic from the beginning of the century Before I had time to utter a </p>
 <p>single word, I found myself in a strange-looking bed. Carol was with me. She half sat up </p>
 <p>at the same time I did. We were naked, each covered with a thin blanket..</p>
 <p>"What's going on?" she asked in a feeble voice.</p>
 <p>"Are you awake?" I asked inanely.</p>
 <p>"Of course I am awake," she said in an impatient tone.</p>
 <p>"Do you remember where we were?" I asked.</p>
 <p>There was a long silence, as she obviously tried to put her thoughts in order. "I think I am </p>
 <p>real, but you are not," she finally said. "I know where I was before this. And you want to </p>
 <p>trick me."</p>
 <p>I thought she was doing the same thing herself. She knew what was going on and was </p>
 <p>testing me or pulling my leg. Don Juan had told me that her demons and mine were </p>
 <p>caginess and distrust. I was having a grand sample of that.</p>
 <p>"I refuse to be part of any shit where you are in control," she said. She looked at me with </p>
 <p>venom in her eyes. "I am talking to you, whoever you are."</p>
 <p>She took one of the blankets we had been covered with and wrapped herself with it. "I am </p>
 <p>going to lie here and go back to where I came from," she said, with an air of finality. </p>
 <p>"You and the nagual go and play with each other."</p>
 <p>"You have to stop this nonsense," I said forcefully. "We are in another world."</p>
 <p>She didn't pay any attention and turned her back to me like an annoyed, pampered child. </p>
 <p>I did not want to waste my dreaming attention in futile discussions of realness. I began to </p>
 <p>examine my surroundings. The only light in the room was moonlight shining through the </p>
 <p>window directly in front of us. We were in a small room, on a high bed. I noticed that the </p>
 <p>bed was primitively constructed. Four thick posts had been planted in the ground, and the </p>
 <p>bed frame was a lattice, made of long poles attached to the posts. The bed had a thick </p>
 <p>mattress, or rather a compact mattress. There were no sheets or pillows. Filled burlap </p>
 <p>sacks were stacked up against the walls. Two sacks by the foot of the bed, staggered one </p>
 <p>on top of the other, served as a stepladder to climb onto it.</p>
 <p>Looking for a light switch, I became aware that the high bed was in a corner, against the </p>
 <p>wall. Our heads were to the wall; I was on the outside of the bed and Carol on the inside. </p>
 <p>When I sat on the edge of the bed, I realized that it was perhaps over three feet above the </p>
 <p>ground.</p>
 <p>Carol sat up suddenly and said with a heavy lisp, "This is disgusting! The nagual </p>
 <p>certainly didn't tell me I was going to end up like this."</p>
 <p>"I didn't know it either," I said. I wanted to say more and start a conversation, but my </p>
 <p>anxiety had grown to extravagant proportions.</p>
 <p>"You shut up," she snapped at me, her voice cracking with anger. "You don't exist. </p>
 <p>You're a ghost. Disappear! Disappear!"</p>
 <p>Her lisping was actually cute and distracted me from my obsessive fear. I shook her by </p>
 <p>the shoulders. She yelled, not so much in pain as in surprise or annoyance.</p>
 <p>"I'm not a ghost," I said. "We made the journey because we joined our energy."</p>
 <p>Carol Tiggs was famous among us for her speed in adapting to any situation. In no time </p>
 <p>at all she was convinced of the real ness of our predicament and began to look for her </p>
 <p>clothes in the semidarkness. I marveled at the fact that she was not afraid. She became </p>
 <p>busy, reasoning out loud where she might have put her clothes had she gone to bed in that </p>
 <p>room.</p>
 <p>"Do you see any chair?" she asked.</p>
 <p>I faintly saw a stack of three sacks that might have served as a table or high bench. She </p>
 <p>got out of the bed, went to it, and found her clothes and mine, neatly folded, the way she </p>
 <p>always handled garments. She handed my clothes to me; they were my clothes, but not </p>
 <p>the ones I had been wearing a few minutes before, in Carol's room at the Regis Hotel.</p>
 <p>"These are not my clothes," she lisped. "And yet they are mine. How strange!"</p>
 <p>We dressed in silence. I wanted to tell her that I was about to burst with anxiety. I also </p>
 <p>wanted to comment on the speed of our journey, but, in the time I had taken to dress, the </p>
 <p>thought of our journey had become very vague. I could hardly remember where we had </p>
 <p>been before waking up in that room. It was as if I had dreamt the hotel room. I made a </p>
 <p>supreme effort to recollect, to push away the vagueness that had begun to envelop me. I </p>
 <p>succeeded in dispelling the fog, but that act exhausted all my energy. I ended up panting </p>
 <p>and sweating.</p>
 <p>"Something nearly, nearly got me," Carol said. I looked at her. She, like me, was covered </p>
 <p>with perspiration. "It nearly got you too. What do you think it is?"</p>
 <p>"The position of the assemblage point," I said with absolute certainty</p>
 <p>She did not agree with me. "It's the inorganic beings collecting their dues," she said </p>
 <p>shivering. "The nagual told me it was going to be horrible, but I never imagined anything </p>
 <p>this horrible."</p>
 <p>I was in total agreement with her; we were in a horrifying mess, yet I could not conceive </p>
 <p>what the horror of that situation was. Carol and I were not novices; we had seen and done </p>
 <p>endless things, some of them outright terrifying. But there was something in that dream </p>
 <p>room that chilled me beyond belief.</p>
 <p>"We are dreaming, aren't we?" Carol asked.</p>
 <p>Without hesitation, I reassured her that we were, although I would have given anything to </p>
 <p>have don Juan there to reassure me of the same thing.</p>
 <p>"Why am I so frightened?" she asked me, as if I were capable of rationally explaining it.</p>
 <p>Before I could formulate a thought about it, she answered her question herself. She said </p>
 <p>that what frightened her was to realize, at a body level, that perceiving is an all-inclusive </p>
 <p>act when the assemblage point has been immobilized on one position. She reminded me </p>
 <p>that don Juan had told us that the power our daily world has over us is a result of the fact </p>
 <p>that our assemblage point is immobile on its habitual position. This immobility is what </p>
 <p>makes our perception of the world so inclusive and overpowering that we cannot escape </p>
 <p>from it. Carol also reminded me about another thing the nagual had said: that if we want </p>
 <p>to break this totally inclusive force, all we have to do is dispel the fog, that is to say, </p>
 <p>displace the assemblage point by intending its displacement.</p>
 <p>I had never really understood what don Juan meant until the moment I had to bring my </p>
 <p>assemblage point to another position, in order to dispel that world's fog, which had begun </p>
 <p>to swallow me.</p>
 <p>Carol and I, without saying another word, went to the window and looked out. We were </p>
 <p>in the country. The moonlight revealed some low, dark shapes of dwelling structures. By </p>
 <p>all indications, we were in the utility or supply room of a farm or a big country house.</p>
 <p>"Do you remember going to bed here?" Carol asked.</p>
 <p>"I almost do," I said and meant it. I told her I had to fight to keep the image of her hotel </p>
 <p>room in my mind, as a point of reference.</p>
 <p>"I have to do the same," she said in a frightened whisper. "I know that if we let go of that </p>
 <p>memory, we are goners."</p>
 <p>Then she asked me if I wanted us to leave that shack and venture outside. I did not. My </p>
 <p>apprehension was so acute that I was unable to voice my words. I could only give her a </p>
 <p>signal with my head.</p>
 <p>"You are so very right not to want to go out," she said. "I have the feeling that if we leave </p>
 <p>this shack, we'll never make it back."</p>
 <p>I was going to open the door and just look outside, but she stopped me. "Don't do that," </p>
 <p>she said. "You might let the outside in."</p>
 <p>The thought that crossed my mind at that instant was that we had been placed inside a </p>
 <p>frail cage. Anything, such as opening the door, might upset the precarious balance of that </p>
 <p>cage. At the moment I had that thought, both of us had the same urge. We took off our </p>
 <p>clothes as if our lives depended on that. We then jumped into the high bed without using </p>
 <p>the two sack steps, only to jump down from it in the next instant.</p>
 <p>It was evident that Carol and I had the same realization at the same time. She confirmed </p>
 <p>my assumption when she said, "Anything that we use belonging to this world can only </p>
 <p>weaken us. If I stand here naked and away from the bed and away from the window, I </p>
 <p>don't have any problem remembering where I came from. But if I lie in that bed or wear </p>
 <p>those clothes or look out the window, I am done for."</p>
 <p>We stood in the center of the room for a long time, huddled together. A weird suspicion </p>
 <p>began to fester in my mind. "How are we going to return to our world?" I asked, </p>
 <p>expecting her to know.</p>
 <p>"The reentry into our world is automatic if we don't let the fog set in," she said with the </p>
 <p>air of a foremost authority which was her trademark.</p>
 <p>And she was right. Carol and I woke up, at the same time, in the bed of her room in the </p>
 <p>Regis Hotel. It was so obvious we were back in the world of daily life that we didn't ask </p>
 <p>questions or make comments about it. The sunlight was nearly blinding.</p>
 <p>"How did we get back?" Carol asked. "Or rather, when did we get back?"</p>
 <p>I had no idea what to say or what to think. I was too numb to speculate, which was all I </p>
 <p>could have done.</p>
 <p>"Do you think that we just returned?" Carol insisted. "Or maybe we've been asleep here </p>
 <p>all night. Look! We're naked. When did we take our clothes off?"</p>
 <p>"We took them off in that other world," I said and surprised myself with the sound of my </p>
 <p>voice.</p>
 <p>My answer seemed to stump Carol. She looked uncomprehendingly at me and then at her </p>
 <p>own naked body.</p>
 <p>We sat there without moving for an endless time. Both of us seemed to be deprived of </p>
 <p>volition. But then, quite abruptly, we had the same thought at exactly the same time. We </p>
 <p>got dressed in record time, ran out of the room, went down two flights of stairs, crossed </p>
 <p>the street, and rushed into don Juan's hotel.</p>
 <p>Inexplicably and excessively out of breath, since we had not really exerted ourselves </p>
 <p>physically, we took turns explaining to him what we had done.</p>
 <p>He confirmed our conjectures. "What you two did was about the most dangerous thing </p>
 <p>one can imagine," he said.</p>
 <p>He addressed Carol and told her that our attempt had been both a total success and a </p>
 <p>fiasco. We had succeeded in transferring our awareness of the daily world to our energy </p>
 <p>bodies, thus making the journey with all our physicality but we had failed in avoiding the </p>
 <p>influence of the inorganic beings. He said that ordinarily dreamers experience the whole </p>
 <p>maneuver as a series of slow transitions, and that they have to voice their intent to use </p>
 <p>awareness as an element. In our case, all those steps were dispensed with. Because of the </p>
 <p>intervention of the inorganic beings, the two of us had actually been hurled into a deadly </p>
 <p>world with a most terrifying speed.</p>
 <p>"It wasn't your combined energy that made your journey possible," he continued. </p>
 <p>"Something else did that. It even selected adequate clothes for you."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, nagual, that the clothes and the bed and the room happened only because </p>
 <p>we were being run by the inorganic beings?" Carol asked.</p>
 <p>"You bet your life," he replied. "Ordinarily, dreamers are merely voyeurs. The way your </p>
 <p>journey turned out, you two got a ringside seat and lived the old sorcerers' damnation. </p>
 <p>What happened to them was precisely what happened to you. The inorganic beings took </p>
 <p>them to worlds from which they could not return. I should have known, but it didn't even </p>
 <p>enter my mind, that the inorganic beings would take over and try to set up the same trap </p>
 <p>for you two."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean they wanted to keep us there?" Carol asked.</p>
 <p>"If you had gotten outside that shack, you'd now be meandering hopelessly in that </p>
 <p>world," don Juan said.</p>
 <p>He explained that since we entered into that world with all our physicality, the fixation of </p>
 <p>our assemblage points on the position preselected by the inorganic beings was so </p>
 <p>overpowering that it created a sort of fog that obliterated any memory of the world we </p>
 <p>came from. He added that the natural consequence of such an immobility, as in the case </p>
 <p>of the sorcerers of antiquity, is that the dreamer's assemblage point cannot return to its </p>
 <p>habitual position.</p>
 <p>"Think about this," he urged us. "Perhaps this is exactly what is happening to all of us in </p>
 <p>the world of daily life. We are here, and the fixation of our assemblage point is so </p>
 <p>overpowering that it has made us forget where we came from, and what our purpose was </p>
 <p>for coming here."</p>
 <p>Don Juan did not want to say any more about our journey. I felt that he was sparing us </p>
 <p>further discomfort and fear. He took us to eat a late lunch. By the time we reached the </p>
 <p>restaurant, a couple of blocks down Francisco Madero Avenue, it was six o'clock in the </p>
 <p>afternoon. Carol and I had slept, if that is what we did, about eighteen hours.</p>
 <p>Only don Juan was hungry. Carol remarked with a touch of anger that he was eating like </p>
 <p>a pig. Quite a few heads turned in our direction on hearing don Juan's laughter.</p>
 <p>It was a warm night. The sky was clear. There was a soft, caressing breeze as we sat </p>
 <p>down on a bench in the Paseo Alameda.</p>
 <p>"There is a question that's burning me," Carol said to don Juan. "We didn't use </p>
 <p>awareness as a medium for traveling, right?"</p>
 <p>"That's true," don Juan said and sighed deeply. "The task was to sneak by the inorganic </p>
 <p>beings, not be run by them."</p>
 <p>"What's going to happen now?" she asked.</p>
 <p>"You are going to postpone stalking the stalkers until you two are stronger," he said. "Or </p>
 <p>perhaps you'll never accomplish it. It doesn't really matter; if one thing doesn't work, </p>
 <p>another will. Sorcery is an endless challenge."</p>
 <p>He explained to us again, as if he were trying to fix his explanation in our minds, that in </p>
 <p>order to use awareness as an element of the environment, dreamers first have to make a </p>
 <p>journey to the inorganic beings' realm. Then they have to use the journey as a </p>
 <p>springboard, and, while they are in possession of the necessary dark energy they have to </p>
 <p>intend to be hurled through the medium of awareness into another world.</p>
 <p>"The failure of your trip was that you didn't have time to use awareness as an element for </p>
 <p>traveling," he went on. "Before you even got to the inorganic beings' world, you two, </p>
 <p>were already in another world."</p>
 <p>"What do you recommend we do?" Carol asked.</p>
 <p>"I recommend that you see as little of each other as possible," he said. "I'm sure the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings will not pass the opportunity to get you two, especially if you join </p>
 <p>forces."</p>
 <p>So Carol Tiggs and I deliberately stayed away from each other from then on. The </p>
 <p>prospect that we might inadvertently elicit a similar journey was too great a risk for us. </p>
 <p>Don Juan encouraged our decision by repeating over and over that we had enough </p>
 <p>combined energy to tempt the inorganic beings to lure us again.</p>
 <p>Don Juan brought my dreaming practices back to seeing energy in energy-generating </p>
 <p>dreamlike states. In the course of time, I saw everything that presented itself to me. I </p>
 <p>entered in this manner into a most peculiar state: I became incapable of rendering </p>
 <p>intelligently what I saw. My sensation was always that I had reached states of perception </p>
 <p>for which I had no lexicon.</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained my incomprehensible and indescribable visions as my energy body </p>
 <p>using awareness as an element not for journeying, because I never had enough energy, </p>
 <p>but for entering into the energy fields of inanimate matter or of living beings.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 11</p>
 <p>THE TENANT</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>There were no more dreaming practices for me, as I was accustomed to having them. The </p>
 <p>next time I saw don Juan, he put me under the guidance of two women of his party:</p>
 <p>Florinda and Zuleica, his two closest cohorts. Their instruction was not at all about the </p>
 <p>gates of dreaming but about different ways to use the energy body, and it did not last long </p>
 <p>enough to be influential. They gave me the impression that they were more interested in </p>
 <p>checking me out than in teaching me any thing.</p>
 <p>"There is nothing else I can teach you about dreaming," don Juan said when I questioned </p>
 <p>him about this state of affairs.</p>
 <p>"My time on this earth is up. But Florinda will stay. She's the one who will direct, not </p>
 <p>only you but all my other apprentices."</p>
 <p>"Will she continue my dreaming practices?"</p>
 <p>"I don't know that, and neither does she. It's all up to the spirit. The real player. We are </p>
 <p>not players ourselves. We are mere pawns in its hands. Following the commands of the </p>
 <p>spirit, I have to tell you what the fourth gate of dreaming is, although I can't guide you </p>
 <p>anymore."</p>
 <p>"What's the point of whetting my appetite? I'd rather not know."</p>
 <p>"The spirit is not leaving that up to me or to you. I have to outline the fourth gate of </p>
 <p>dreaming for you, whether I like it or not."</p>
 <p>Don Juan explained that, at the fourth gate of dreaming, the energy body travels to </p>
 <p>specific, concrete places and that there are three ways of using the fourth gate: one, to </p>
 <p>travel to concrete places in this world; two, to travel to concrete places out of this world; </p>
 <p>and, three, to travel to places that exist only in the intent of others. He stated that the last </p>
 <p>one is the most difficult and dangerous of the three and was, by far, the old sorcerers' </p>
 <p>predilection.</p>
 <p>"What do you want me to do with this knowledge?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Nothing for the moment. File it away until you need it."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean that I can cross the fourth gate by myself, without help?"</p>
 <p>"Whether or not you can do that is up to the spirit."</p>
 <p>He abruptly dropped the subject, but he did not leave me with the sensation that I should </p>
 <p>try to reach and cross the fourth gate by myself.</p>
 <p>Don Juan then made one last appointment with me to give me, he said, a sorcerers' send-</p>
 <p>off: the concluding touch of my dreaming practices. He told me to meet him in the small </p>
 <p>town in southern Mexico where he and his sorcerer companions lived.</p>
 <p>I arrived there in the late afternoon. Don Juan and I sat in the patio of his house on some </p>
 <p>uncomfortable wicker chairs fitted with thick, oversize pillows. Don Juan laughed and </p>
 <p>winked at me. The chairs were a gift from one of the women members of his party and </p>
 <p>we simply had to sit as if nothing was bothering us, especially him. The chairs had been </p>
 <p>bought for him in Phoenix, Arizona, and with great difficulty brought into Mexico.</p>
 <p>Don Juan asked me to read to him a poem by Dylan Thomas, which he said had the most </p>
 <p>pertinent meaning for me at that point in time.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> I have longed to move away</p>
 <p> From the hissing of the spent lie</p>
 <p> And the old terrors' continual cry</p>
 <p> Growing more terrible as the day</p>
 <p> Goes over the hill into the deep sea.</p>
 <p> I have longed to move away but am afraid;</p>
 <p> Some life, yet unspent, might explode</p>
 <p> Out of the old lie burning on the ground,</p>
 <p> And, crackling into the air, leave me half-blind.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Don Juan stood up and said that he was going for a walk in the plaza, in the center of </p>
 <p>town. He asked me to come along. I immediately assumed that the poem had evoked a </p>
 <p>negative response in him and he needed to dispel it.</p>
 <p>We reached the square plaza without having said a word. We walked around it a couple </p>
 <p>of times, still not talking. There were quite a number of people, milling around the stores </p>
 <p>on the streets facing the east and north sides of the park. All the streets around the plaza </p>
 <p>were unevenly paved. The houses were massive, one-story adobe buildings, with tiled </p>
 <p>roofs, whitewashed wails, and blue or brown painted doors. On a side street, a block </p>
 <p>away from the plaza, the high walls of the enormous colonial church, which looked like a </p>
 <p>Moorish mosque, loomed ominously over the roof of the only hotel in town. On the south </p>
 <p>side, there were two restaurants, which inexplicably coexisted side by side, doing good </p>
 <p>business, serving practically the same menu at the same prices.</p>
 <p>I broke the silence and asked don Juan whether he also found it odd that both restaurants </p>
 <p>were just about the same.</p>
 <p>"Everything is possible in this town," he replied.</p>
 <p>The way he said it made me feel uneasy.</p>
 <p>"Why are you so nervous?" he asked, with a serious expression. "Do you know </p>
 <p>something you're not telling me?"</p>
 <p>"Why am I nervous? That's a laugh. I am always nervous around you, don Juan. </p>
 <p>Sometimes more so than others."</p>
 <p>He seemed to be making a serious effort not to laugh. "Naguals are not really the most </p>
 <p>friendly beings on earth," he said in a tone of apology. "I learned this the hard way, being </p>
 <p>pitted against my teacher, the terrible nagual Julian. His mere presence used to scare the </p>
 <p>daylights out of me. And when he used to zero in on me, I always thought my life wasn't </p>
 <p>worth a plug nickel."</p>
 <p>"Unquestionably, don Juan, you have the same effect on me."</p>
 <p>He laughed openly. "No, no. You are definitely exaggerating. I'm an angel in </p>
 <p>comparison."</p>
 <p>"You may be an angel in comparison, except that I don't have the nagual Julian to </p>
 <p>compare you with."</p>
 <p>He laughed for a moment, then became serious again.</p>
 <p>"I don't know why, but I definitely feel scared," I explained.</p>
 <p>"Do you feel you have reason to be scared?" he asked and stopped walking to peer at me.</p>
 <p>His tone of voice and his raised eyebrows gave me the impression he suspected that I </p>
 <p>knew something I was not revealing to him. He was clearly expecting a disclosure on my </p>
 <p>part.</p>
 <p>"Your insistence makes me wonder," I said. "Are you sure you are not the one who has </p>
 <p>something up his sleeve?"</p>
 <p>"I do have something up my sleeve," he admitted and grinned. "But that's not the issue. </p>
 <p>The issue is that there is something in this town awaiting you. And you don't quite know </p>
 <p>what it is or you do know what it is but don't dare to tell me, or you don't know anything </p>
 <p>about it at all."</p>
 <p>"What's waiting for me here?"</p>
 <p>Instead of answering me, don Juan briskly resumed his walking, and we kept going </p>
 <p>around the plaza in complete silence. We circled it quite a few times, looking for a place </p>
 <p>to sit. Then, a group of young women got up from a bench and left.</p>
 <p>"For years now, I have been describing to you the aberrant practices of the sorcerers of </p>
 <p>ancient Mexico," don Juan said as he sat down on the bench and gestured for me to sit by </p>
 <p>him.</p>
 <p>With the fervor of someone who has never said it before, he began to tell me again what </p>
 <p>he had told me many times, that those sorcerers, guided by extremely selfish interests, put </p>
 <p>all their efforts into perfecting practices that pushed them further and further away from </p>
 <p>sobriety or mental balance, and that they were finally exterminated when their complex </p>
 <p>edifices of beliefs and practices became so cumbersome that they could no longer support </p>
 <p>them.</p>
 <p>"The sorcerers of antiquity, of course, lived and proliferated in this area," he said, </p>
 <p>watching my reaction. "Here in this town. This town was built on the actual foundations </p>
 <p>of one of their towns. Here in this area, the sorcerers of antiquity carried on all their </p>
 <p>dealings."</p>
 <p>"Do you know this for a fact, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"I do, and so will you, very soon."</p>
 <p>My mounting anxiety was forcing me to do something I detested: to focus on myself. </p>
 <p>Don Juan, sensing my frustration, egged me on.</p>
 <p>"Very soon, we'll know whether or not you're really like the old sorcerers or like the new </p>
 <p>ones," he said.</p>
 <p>"You are driving me nuts with all this strange and ominous talk," I protested.</p>
 <p>Being with don Juan for thirteen years had conditioned me, above everything else, to </p>
 <p>conceive of panic as something that was just around the corner at all times, ready to be </p>
 <p>released.</p>
 <p>Don Juan seemed to vacillate. I noticed his furtive glances in the direction of the church. </p>
 <p>He was even distracted. When I talked to him, he was not listening. I had to repeat my </p>
 <p>question. "Are you waiting for someone?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, I am," he said. "Most certainly I am. I was just sensing the surroundings. You </p>
 <p>caught me in the act of scanning the area with my energy body."</p>
 <p>"What did you sense, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"My energy body senses that everything is in place. The play is on tonight. You are the </p>
 <p>main protagonist. I am a character actor with a small but meaningful role. I exit in the </p>
 <p>first act."</p>
 <p>"What in the world are you talking about?"</p>
 <p>He did not answer me. He smiled knowingly. "I'm preparing the ground," he said. </p>
 <p>"Warming you up, so to speak, harping on the idea that modern-day sorcerers have </p>
 <p>learned a hard lesson. They have realized that only if they remain totally detached can </p>
 <p>they have the energy to be free. Theirs is a peculiar type of detachment, which is born not </p>
 <p>out of fear or indolence but out of conviction."</p>
 <p>Don Juan paused and stood up, stretched his arms in front of him, to his sides, and then </p>
 <p>behind him. "Do the same," he advised me. "It relaxes the body, and you have to be very </p>
 <p>relaxed to face what's coming to you tonight." He smiled broadly. "Either total </p>
 <p>detachment or utter indulging is coming to you tonight. It is a choice that every nagual in </p>
 <p>my line has to make." He sat down again and took a deep breath. What he had said </p>
 <p>seemed to have taken all his energy.</p>
 <p>"I think I can understand detachment and indulging," he went on, "because I had the </p>
 <p>privilege of knowing two naguals: my benefactor, the nagual Julian, and his benefactor, </p>
 <p>the nagual Elias. I witnessed the difference between the two. The nagual Elias was </p>
 <p>detached to the point that he could put aside a gift of power. The nagual Julian was also </p>
 <p>detached, but not enough to put aside such a gift."</p>
 <p>"Judging by the way you're talking," I said, "I would say that you are going to spring </p>
 <p>some sort of test on me tonight. Is that true?"</p>
 <p>"I don't have the power to spring tests of any sort on you, but the spirit does." He said </p>
 <p>this with a grin, then added, "I am merely its agent."</p>
 <p>"What is the spirit going to do to me, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"All I can say is that tonight you're going to get a lesson in dreaming, the way lessons in </p>
 <p>dreaming used to be, but you are not going to get that lesson from me. Someone else is </p>
 <p>going to be your teacher and guide you tonight."</p>
 <p>"Who is going to be my teacher and guide?"</p>
 <p>"A visitor, who might be a horrendous surprise to you or no surprise at all."</p>
 <p>"And what's the lesson in dreaming I am going to get?"</p>
 <p>"It's a lesson about the fourth gate of dreaming. And it is in two parts. The first part I'll </p>
 <p>explain to you presently. The second part nobody can explain to you, because it is </p>
 <p>something that pertains only to you. All the naguals of my line got this two-part lesson, </p>
 <p>but no two of those lessons were alike; they were tailored to fit those naguals' personal </p>
 <p>bents of character."</p>
 <p>"Your explanation doesn't help me at all, don Juan. I am getting more and more </p>
 <p>nervous."</p>
 <p>We remained quiet for a long moment. I was shaken up and fidgety and did not know </p>
 <p>what else to say without actually nagging.</p>
 <p>"As you already know, for modem-day sorcerers to perceive energy directly is a matter of </p>
 <p>personal attainment," don Juan said. "We maneuver the assemblage point through self-</p>
 <p>discipline. For the old sorcerers, the displacement of the assemblage point was a </p>
 <p>consequence of their subjugation to others, their teachers, who accomplished those </p>
 <p>displacements through dark operations and gave them to their disciples as gifts of power.</p>
 <p>"It's possible for someone with greater energy than ours to do anything to us," he went </p>
 <p>on. "For example, the nagual Julian could have turned me into anything he wanted, a </p>
 <p>fiend or a saint. But he was an impeccable nagual and let me be myself. The old sorcerers </p>
 <p>were not that impeccable, and, by means of their ceaseless efforts to gain control over </p>
 <p>others, they created a situation of darkness and terror that was passed on from teacher to </p>
 <p>disciple."</p>
 <p>He stood up and swept his gaze all around us. "As you can see, this town isn't much," he </p>
 <p>continued, "but it has a unique fascination for the warriors of my line. Here lies the </p>
 <p>source of what we are and the source of what we don't want to be.</p>
 <p>"Since I am at the end of my time, I must pass on to you certain ideas, recount to you </p>
 <p>certain stories, put you in touch with certain beings, right here in this town, exactly as my </p>
 <p>benefactor did with me."</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that he was reiterating something I already was familiar with, that </p>
 <p>whatever he was and everything he knew were a legacy from his teacher, the nagual </p>
 <p>Julian. He in turn inherited everything from his teacher, the nagual Elias. The nagual </p>
 <p>Elias from the nagual Rosendo; he from the nagual Lujan; the nagual Lujan from the </p>
 <p>nagual Santisteban; and the nagual Santisteban from the nagual Sebastian.</p>
 <p>He told me again, in a very formal tone, something he had explained to me many times </p>
 <p>before, that there were eight naguals before the nagual Sebastian, but that they were quite </p>
 <p>different. They had a different attitude toward sorcery, a different concept of it, although </p>
 <p>they were still directly related to his sorcery lineage.</p>
 <p>"You must recollect now, and repeat to me, everything I've told you about the nagual </p>
 <p>Sebastian," he demanded.</p>
 <p>His request seemed odd to me, but I repeated everything I had been told by him or by any </p>
 <p>of his companions about the nagual Sebastian and the mythical old sorcerer, the death </p>
 <p>defier, known to them as the tenant.</p>
 <p>"You know that the death defier makes us gifts of power every generation," don Juan </p>
 <p>said. "And the specific nature of those gifts of power is what changed the course of our </p>
 <p>lineage."</p>
 <p>He explained that the tenant, being a sorcerer from the old school, had learned from his </p>
 <p>teachers all the intricacies of shifting his assemblage point. Since he had perhaps </p>
 <p>thousands of years of strange life and awareness-ample time to perfect anything-he </p>
 <p>knew now how to reach and hold hundreds, if not thousands, of positions of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point. His gifts were like both maps for shifting the assemblage point to </p>
 <p>specific spots and manuals on how to immobilize it on any of those positions and thus </p>
 <p>acquire cohesion.</p>
 <p>Don Juan was at the peak of his raconteur's form. I had never seen him more dramatic. </p>
 <p>If! had not known him better, I would have sworn that his voice had the deep and worried </p>
 <p>inflection of someone gripped by fear or preoccupation. His gestures gave me the </p>
 <p>impression of a good actor portraying nervousness and concern to perfection.</p>
 <p>Don Juan peered at me, and, in the tone and manner of some one making a painful </p>
 <p>revelation, he said that, for instance, the nagual Lujan received from the tenant a gift of </p>
 <p>fifty positions. He shook his head rhythmically, as if he were silently asking me to </p>
 <p>consider what he had just said. I kept quiet.</p>
 <p>"Fifty positions!" he exclaimed in wonder. "For a gift, one or, at the most, two positions </p>
 <p>of the assemblage point should be more than adequate."</p>
 <p>He shrugged his shoulders, gesturing bewilderment. "I was told that the tenant liked the </p>
 <p>nagual Lujan immensely," he continued. "They struck up such a close friendship that </p>
 <p>they were practically inseparable. I was told that the nagual Lujan and the tenant used to </p>
 <p>stroll into the church over there every morning for early mass."</p>
 <p>"Right here, in this town?" I asked, in total surprise.</p>
 <p>"Right here," he replied. "Possibly they sat down on this very spot, on another bench, </p>
 <p>over a hundred years ago."</p>
 <p>"The nagual Lujan and the tenant really walked in this plaza?" I asked again, unable to </p>
 <p>overcome my surprise.</p>
 <p>"You bet!" he exclaimed. "I brought you here tonight because the poem you were reading </p>
 <p>to me cued me that it was time for you to meet the tenant.".</p>
 <p>Panic overtook me with the speed of wildfire. I had to breathe through my mouth for a </p>
 <p>moment.</p>
 <p>"We have been discussing the strange accomplishments of the sorcerers of ancient </p>
 <p>times," don Juan continued. "But it's always hard when one has to talk exclusively in </p>
 <p>idealities, without any firsthand knowledge. I can repeat to you from now until doomsday </p>
 <p>something that is crystal clear to me but impossible for you to understand or believe, </p>
 <p>because you don't have any practical knowledge of it."</p>
 <p>He stood up and gazed at me from head to toe. "Let's go to church," he said. "The tenant </p>
 <p>likes the church and its surroundings. I'm positive this is the moment to go there."</p>
 <p>Very few times in the course of my association with don Juan had I felt such </p>
 <p>apprehension. I was numb. My entire body trembled when I stood up. My stomach was </p>
 <p>tied in knots, yet I followed him without a word when he headed for the church, my </p>
 <p>knees wobbling and sagging involuntarily every time I took a step. By the time we had </p>
 <p>walked the short block from the plaza to the limestone steps of the church portico, I was </p>
 <p>about to faint. Don Juan put his arm around my shoulders to prop me up.</p>
 <p>"There's the tenant," he said as casually as if he had just spotted an old friend.</p>
 <p>I looked in the direction he was pointing and saw a group of five women and three men at </p>
 <p>the far end of the portico. My fast and panicked glance did not register anything unusual </p>
 <p>about those people. I couldn't even tell whether they were going into the church or </p>
 <p>coming out of it. I noticed, though, that they seemed to be congregated there accidentally. </p>
 <p>They were not together.</p>
 <p>By the time don Juan and I reached the small door, cut out in the church's massive </p>
 <p>wooden portals, three women had entered the church. The three men and the other two </p>
 <p>women were walking away. I experienced a moment of confusion and looked at don Juan </p>
 <p>for directions. He pointed with a movement of his chin to the holy water font.</p>
 <p>"We must observe the rules and cross ourselves," he whispered.</p>
 <p>"Where's the tenant?" I asked, also in a whisper.</p>
 <p>Don Juan dipped the tips of his fingers in the basin and made the sign of the cross. With </p>
 <p>an imperative gesture of the chin, he urged me to do the same.</p>
 <p>"Was the tenant one of the three men who left?" I whispered nearly in his ear.</p>
 <p>"No," he whispered back. "The tenant is one of the three women who stayed. The one in </p>
 <p>the back row."</p>
 <p>At that moment, a woman in the back row turned her head toward me, smiled, and </p>
 <p>nodded at me.</p>
 <p>I reached the door in one jump and ran out.</p>
 <p>Don Juan ran after me. With incredible agility, he overtook me and held me by the arm.</p>
 <p>"Where are you going?" he asked, his face and body contorting with laughter.</p>
 <p>He held me firmly by the arm as I took big gulps of air. I was veritably choking. Peals of </p>
 <p>laughter came out of him, like ocean waves. I forcefully pulled away and walked toward </p>
 <p>the plaza. He followed me.</p>
 <p>"I never imagined you were going to get so upset," he said, as new waves of laughter </p>
 <p>shook his body.</p>
 <p>"Why didn't you tell me that the tenant is a woman?"</p>
 <p>"That sorcerer in there is the death defier," he said solemnly. "For such a sorcerer, so </p>
 <p>versed in the shifts of the assemblage point, to be a man or a woman is a matter of choice </p>
 <p>or convenience. This is the first part of the lesson in dreaming I said you were going to </p>
 <p>get. And the death defier is the mysterious visitor who's going to guide you through it."</p>
 <p>He held his sides as laughter made him cough. I was speechless. Then a sudden fury </p>
 <p>possessed me. I was not mad at don Juan or myself or anyone in particular. It was a cold </p>
 <p>fury, which made me feel as if my chest and all my neck muscles were going to explode.</p>
 <p>"Let's go back to the church," I shouted, and I didn't recognize my own voice.</p>
 <p>"Now, now," he said softly. "You don't have to jump into the fire just like that. Think. </p>
 <p>Deliberate. Measure things up. Cool that mind of yours. Never in your life have you been </p>
 <p>put to such a test. You need calmness now.</p>
 <p>"I can't tell you what to do," he continued. "I can only, like any other nagual, put you in </p>
 <p>front of your challenge, after telling you, in quite oblique terms, everything that is </p>
 <p>pertinent. This is another of the nagual's maneuvers: to say everything without saying it </p>
 <p>or to ask without asking."</p>
 <p>I wanted to get it over with quickly. But don Juan said that a moment's pause would </p>
 <p>restore whatever was left of my self- assurance. My knees were about to give in. </p>
 <p>Solicitously, don Juan made me sit down on the curb. He sat next to me.</p>
 <p>"The first part of the dreaming lesson in question is that maleness and femaleness are not </p>
 <p>final states but are the result of a specific act of positioning the assemblage point," he </p>
 <p>said. "And this act is, naturally, a matter of volition and training. Since it was a subject </p>
 <p>close to the old sorcerers' hearts, they are the only ones who can shed light on it."</p>
 <p>Perhaps because it was the only rational thing to do, I began to argue with don Juan. "I </p>
 <p>can't accept or believe what you are saying," I said. I felt heat rising to my face.</p>
 <p>"But you saw the woman," don Juan retorted. "Do you think that all of this is a trick?"</p>
 <p>"I don't know what to think."</p>
 <p>"That being in the church is a real woman," he said forcefully. "Why should that be so </p>
 <p>disturbing to you? The fact that she was born a man attests only to the power of the old </p>
 <p>sorcerers' machinations. This shouldn't surprise you. You have already embodied all the </p>
 <p>principles of sorcery."</p>
 <p>My insides were about to burst with tension. In an accusing tone, don Juan said that I was </p>
 <p>just being argumentative. With forced patience but real pomposity, I explained to him the </p>
 <p>biological foundation of maleness and femaleness.</p>
 <p>"I understand all that," he said. "And you're right in what you're saying. Your flaw is to </p>
 <p>try to make your assessments universal."</p>
 <p>"What we're talking about are basic principles," I shouted. "They'll be pertinent to man </p>
 <p>here or in any other place in the universe."</p>
 <p>"True. True," he said in a quiet voice. "Everything you say is true as long as our </p>
 <p>assemblage point remains on its habitual position. But the moment it is displaced beyond </p>
 <p>certain boundaries and our daily world is no longer in function, none of the principles you </p>
 <p>cherish has the total value you're talking about.</p>
 <p>"Your mistake is to forget that the death defier has transcended those boundaries </p>
 <p>thousands upon thousands of times. It doesn't take a genius to realize that the tenant is no </p>
 <p>longer bound by the same forces that bind you now."</p>
 <p>I told him that my quarrel, if it could be called a quarrel, was not with him but with </p>
 <p>accepting the practical side of sorcery, which, up to that moment, had been so farfetched </p>
 <p>that it had never posed a real problem to me. I reiterated that, as a dreamer, it was within </p>
 <p>my experience to attest that in dreaming anything is possible. I reminded him that he </p>
 <p>himself had sponsored and cultivated this conviction, together with the ultimate necessity </p>
 <p>for soundness of mind. What he was proposing as the tenant's case was not sane. It was a </p>
 <p>subject only for dreaming, certainly not for the daily world. I let him know that to me it </p>
 <p>was an abhorrent and untenable proposition.</p>
 <p>"Why this violent reaction?" he asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>His question caught me off guard. I felt embarrassed. "I think it threatens me at the core," </p>
 <p>I admitted. And I meant it. To think that the woman in the church was a man was </p>
 <p>somehow nauseating to me.</p>
 <p>A thought played in my mind: perhaps the tenant is a transvestite. I queried don Juan, in </p>
 <p>earnest, about this possibility. He laughed so hard he seemed about to get ill.</p>
 <p>"That's too mundane a possibility." he said. "Maybe your old friends would do such a </p>
 <p>thing. Your new ones are more resourceful and less masturbatory. I repeat. That being in </p>
 <p>the church is a woman. It is a she. And she has all the organs and attributes of a female." </p>
 <p>He smiled maliciously. "You've always been attracted to women, haven't you? It seems </p>
 <p>that this situation has been tailored just for you."</p>
 <p>His mirth was so intense and childlike that it was contagious. We both laughed. He, with </p>
 <p>total abandon. I, with total apprehension.</p>
 <p>I came to a decision then. I stood up and said out loud that I had no desire to deal with the </p>
 <p>tenant in any form or shape. My choice was to bypass all this business and go back to don </p>
 <p>Juan's house and then home.</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that my decision was perfectly all right with him, and we started back to </p>
 <p>his house. My thoughts raced wildly. Am I doing the right thing? Am I running away out </p>
 <p>of fear? Of course, I immediately rationalized my decision as the right and unavoidable </p>
 <p>one. After all, I assured myself, I was not interested in acquisitions, and the tenant's gifts </p>
 <p>were like acquiring property. Then doubt and curiosity hit me. There were so many </p>
 <p>questions I could have asked the death defier.</p>
 <p>My heart began to pound so intensely I felt it beating against my stomach. The pounding </p>
 <p>suddenly changed into the emissary's voice. It broke its promise not to interfere and said </p>
 <p>that an incredible force was accelerating my heart beat in order to drive me back to the </p>
 <p>church; to walk toward don Juan's house was to walk toward my death.</p>
 <p>I stopped walking and hurriedly confronted don Juan with the emissary's words. "Is this </p>
 <p>true?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"I am afraid it is," he admitted sheepishly.</p>
 <p>"Why didn't you tell me yourself, don Juan? Were you going to let me die because you </p>
 <p>think I am a coward?" I asked in a furious mood.</p>
 <p>"You were not going to die just like that. Your energy body has endless resources. And it </p>
 <p>had never occurred to me to think you're a coward. I respect your decisions, and I don't </p>
 <p>give a damn about what motivates them."</p>
 <p>"You are at the end of the road, just like me. So be a true nagual. Don't be ashamed of </p>
 <p>what you are. If you were a coward, I think you would have died of fright years ago. But </p>
 <p>if you're too afraid to meet the death defier, then die rather than face him. There is no </p>
 <p>shame in that."</p>
 <p>"Let's go back to the church," I said, as calmly as I could.</p>
 <p>"Now we're getting to the crux of the matter!" don Juan exclaimed. "But first, let's go </p>
 <p>back to the park and sit down on a bench and carefully consider your options. We can </p>
 <p>spare the time; besides, it's too early for the business at hand."</p>
 <p>We walked back to the park and immediately found an unoccupied bench and sat down.</p>
 <p>"You have to understand that only you, yourself, can make the decision to meet or not to </p>
 <p>meet the tenant or to accept or reject his gifts of power," don Juan said. "But your </p>
 <p>decision has to be voiced to the woman in the church, face to face and alone; otherwise it </p>
 <p>won't be valid."</p>
 <p>Don Juan said that the tenant's gifts were extraordinary but that the price for them was </p>
 <p>tremendous. And that he himself did not approve of either, the gifts or the price.</p>
 <p>"Before you make your real decision," don Juan continued, "you have to know all the </p>
 <p>details of our transactions with that sorcerer."</p>
 <p>"I'd rather not hear about this anymore, don Juan," I pleaded.</p>
 <p>"It's your duty to know," he said. "How else are you going to make up your mind?"</p>
 <p>"Don't you think that the less I know about the tenant the better off I'll be?"</p>
 <p>"No. This is not a matter of hiding until the danger is over. This is the moment of truth. </p>
 <p>Everything you've done and experienced in the sorcerers' world has channeled you to </p>
 <p>this spot. I didn't want to say it, because I knew your energy body was going to tell you, </p>
 <p>but there is no way to get out of this appointment. Not even by dying. Do you </p>
 <p>understand?" He shook me by the shoulders. "Do you understand?" he repeated.</p>
 <p>I understood so well that I asked him if it would be possible for him to make me change </p>
 <p>levels of awareness in order to alleviate my fear and discomfort. He nearly made me </p>
 <p>jump with the explosion of his no.</p>
 <p>"You must face the death defier in coldness and with ultimate premeditation," he went </p>
 <p>on. "And you can't do this by proxy."</p>
 <p>Don Juan calmly began to repeat everything he had already told me about the death </p>
 <p>defier. As he talked, I realized that part of my confusion was the result of his use of </p>
 <p>words. He rendered "death defier" in Spanish as el desafiante de la muerte, and "tenant" </p>
 <p>as el inquilino, both of which automatically denote a male. But in describing the </p>
 <p>relationship between the tenant and the naguals of his line, don Juan kept on mixing the </p>
 <p>Spanish-language male and female gender denotation, creating a great confusion in me.</p>
 <p>He said that the tenant was supposed to pay for the energy he took from the naguals of </p>
 <p>our lineage, but that whatever he paid has bound those sorcerers for generations. As </p>
 <p>payment for the energy taken from all those naguals, the woman in the church taught </p>
 <p>them exactly what to do to displace their assemblage point to some specific positions, </p>
 <p>which she herself had chosen. In other words, she bound every one of those men with a </p>
 <p>gift of power consisting of a preselected, specific position of the assemblage point and all </p>
 <p>its implications.</p>
 <p>"What do you mean by 'all its implications,' don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"1 mean the negative results of those gifts. The woman in the church knows only of </p>
 <p>indulging. There is no frugality, no temperance in that woman. For instance, she taught </p>
 <p>the nagual Julian how to arrange his assemblage point to be, just like her, a woman. </p>
 <p>Teaching this to my benefactor, who was an incurable voluptuary, was like giving booze </p>
 <p>to a drunkard."</p>
 <p>"But isn't it up to each one of us to be responsible for what we do?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, indeed. However, some of us have more difficulty than others in being responsible. </p>
 <p>To augment that difficulty deliberately, as that woman does, is to put too much </p>
 <p>unnecessary pressure on us."</p>
 <p>"How do you know the woman in the church does this deliberately?"</p>
 <p>"She has done it to every one of the naguals of my line. If we look at ourselves fairly and </p>
 <p>squarely, we have to admit that the death defier has made us, with his gifts, into a line of </p>
 <p>very indulging, dependent sorcerers."</p>
 <p>I could not overlook his inconsistency of language usage any longer, and I complained to </p>
 <p>him. "You have to speak about that sorcerer as either a male or a female, but not as both," </p>
 <p>I said harshly. "I'm too stiff, and your arbitrary use of gender makes me all the more </p>
 <p>uneasy."</p>
 <p>"I am very uneasy myself," he confessed. "But the truth is that the death defier is both: </p>
 <p>male and female. I've never been able to take that sorcerer's change with grace. I was </p>
 <p>sure you would feel the same way, having seen him as a man first."</p>
 <p>Don Juan reminded me of a time, years before, when he took me to meet the death defier </p>
 <p>and I met a man, a strange Indian who was not old but not young either and was very </p>
 <p>slightly built. I remember mostly his strange accent and his use of one odd metaphor </p>
 <p>when describing things he allegedly had seen. He said, mis ojos se pasearon, my eyes </p>
 <p>walked on. For instance, he said, "My eyes walked on the helmets of the Spanish </p>
 <p>conquerors."</p>
 <p>The event was so fleeting in my mind that I had always thought the meeting had lasted </p>
 <p>only a few minutes. Don Juan later told me that I had been gone with the death defier for </p>
 <p>a whole day.</p>
 <p>"The reason I was trying to find out from you earlier whether you knew what was going </p>
 <p>on," don Juan continued, "was because I thought that years ago you had made an </p>
 <p>appointment with the death defier yourself."</p>
 <p>"You were giving me undue credit, don Juan. In this instance, I really don't know </p>
 <p>whether I am coming or going. But what gave you the idea that I knew?"</p>
 <p>"The death defier seemed to have taken a liking to you. And that meant to me that he </p>
 <p>might have already given you a gift of power, although you didn't remember it. Or he </p>
 <p>might have set up your appointment with him, as a woman. I even suspected she had </p>
 <p>given you precise directions."</p>
 <p>Don Juan remarked that the death defier, being definitely a creature of ritual habits, </p>
 <p>always met the naguals of his line first as a man, as it had happened with the nagual </p>
 <p>Sebastian, and subsequently as a woman.</p>
 <p>"Why do you call the death defier's gifts, gifts of power? And why the mystery?" I asked. </p>
 <p>"You yourself can displace your assemblage point to whatever spot you want, isn't that </p>
 <p>so?"</p>
 <p>"They are called gifts of power because they are products of the specialized knowledge of </p>
 <p>the sorcerers of antiquity," he said. "The mystery about the gifts is that no one on this </p>
 <p>earth, with the exception of the death defier, can give us a sample of that knowledge. </p>
 <p>And, of course, I can displace my assemblage point to whatever spot I want, inside or </p>
 <p>outside man's energy shape. But what I can't do, and only the death defier can, is to </p>
 <p>know what to do with my energy body in each one of those spots in order to get total </p>
 <p>perception, total cohesion."</p>
 <p>He explained, then, that modern-day sorcerers do not know the details of the thousands </p>
 <p>upon thousands of possible positions of the assemblage point.</p>
 <p>"What do you mean by details?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Particular ways of treating the energy body in order to maintain the assemblage point </p>
 <p>fixed on specific positions," he replied.</p>
 <p>He took himself as an example. He said that the death defier's gift of power to him had </p>
 <p>been the position of the assemblage point of a crow and the procedures to manipulate his </p>
 <p>energy body to get the total perception of a crow. Don Juan explained that total </p>
 <p>perception, total cohesion was what the old sorcerers sought at any cost, and that, in the </p>
 <p>case of his own gift of power, total perception came to him by means of a deliberate </p>
 <p>process he had to learn, step by step, as one learns to work a very complex machine.</p>
 <p>Don Juan further explained that most of the shifts modern-day sorcerers experience are </p>
 <p>mild shifts within a thin bundle of energetic luminous filaments inside the luminous egg, </p>
 <p>a bundle called the band of man, or the purely human aspect of the universe's energy. </p>
 <p>Beyond that band, but still within the luminous egg, lies the realm of the grand shifts. </p>
 <p>When the assemblage point shifts to any spot on that area, perception is still </p>
 <p>comprehensible to us, but extremely detailed procedures are required for perception to be </p>
 <p>total.</p>
 <p>"The inorganic beings tricked you and Carol Tiggs in your last journey by helping you </p>
 <p>two to get total cohesion on a grand shift," don Juan said. "They displaced your </p>
 <p>assemblage points to the farthest possible spot, then helped you perceive there as if you </p>
 <p>were in your daily world. A nearly impossible thing. To do that type of perceiving a </p>
 <p>sorcerer needs pragmatic knowledge, or influential friends.</p>
 <p>"Your friends would have betrayed you in the end and left you and Carol to fend for </p>
 <p>yourselves and learn pragmatic measures in order to survive in that world. You two </p>
 <p>would have ended filled to the brim with pragmatic procedures, just like those most </p>
 <p>knowledgeable old sorcerers.</p>
 <p>"Every grand shift has different inner workings," he continued, "which modern sorcerers </p>
 <p>could learn if they knew how to fixate the assemblage point long enough at any grand </p>
 <p>shift. Only the sorcerers of ancient times had the specific knowledge required to do this."</p>
 <p>Don Juan went on to say that the knowledge of specific procedures involved in shifts was </p>
 <p>not available to the eight naguals who preceded the nagual Sebastian, and that the tenant </p>
 <p>showed the nagual Sebastian how to achieve total perception on ten new positions of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point. The nagual Santisteban received seven, the nagual Lujan fifty, the </p>
 <p>nagual Rosendo six, the nagual Elias four, the nagual Julian sixteen, and he was shown </p>
 <p>two; that made a total of ninety-five specific positions of the assemblage point that his </p>
 <p>lineage knew about. He said that if I asked him whether he considered this an advantage </p>
 <p>to his lineage, he would have to say no, because the weight of those gifts put them closer </p>
 <p>to the old sorcerers' mood.</p>
 <p>"Now it's your turn to meet the tenant," he continued. "Perhaps the gifts he will give you </p>
 <p>will offset our total balance and our lineage will plunge into the darkness that finished off </p>
 <p>the old sorcerers."</p>
 <p>"This is so horribly serious, it's sickening," I said.</p>
 <p>"I most sincerely sympathize with you," he retorted with a serious expression. "I know </p>
 <p>it's no consolation to you if I say that this is the toughest trial of a modern nagual. To </p>
 <p>face some thing so old and mysterious as the tenant is not awe-inspiring but revolting. At </p>
 <p>least it was to me, and still is."</p>
 <p>"Why do I have to continue with it, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Because, without knowing it, you accepted the death defier's challenge. I drew an </p>
 <p>acceptance from you in the course of your apprenticeship, in the same manner my teacher </p>
 <p>drew one from me, surreptitiously.</p>
 <p>"I went through the same horror, only a little more brutally than you." He began to </p>
 <p>chuckle. "The nagual Julian was given to playing horrendous jokes. He told me that there </p>
 <p>was a very beautiful and passionate widow who was madly in love with me. The nagual </p>
 <p>used to take me to church often, and I had seen the woman staring at me. I thought she </p>
 <p>was a good-looking woman. And I was a horny young man. When the nagual said that </p>
 <p>she liked me, I fell for it. My awakening was very rude."</p>
 <p>I had to fight not to laugh at don Juan's gesture of lost innocence. Then the idea of his </p>
 <p>predicament hit me, as being not funny but ghastly.</p>
 <p>"Are you sure, don Juan, that that woman is the tenant?" I asked, hoping that perhaps it </p>
 <p>was a mistake or a bad joke.</p>
 <p>"I am very, very sure," he said. "Besides, even if I were so dumb as to forget the tenant, </p>
 <p>my seeing can't fail me."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean, don Juan, that the tenant has a different type of energy?"</p>
 <p>"No, not a different type of energy, but certainly different energy features than a normal </p>
 <p>person."</p>
 <p>"Are you absolutely sure, don Juan, that that woman is the tenant?" I insisted, driven by a </p>
 <p>strange revulsion and fear.</p>
 <p>"That woman is the tenant!" don Juan exclaimed in a voice that admitted no doubts.</p>
 <p>We remained quiet. I waited for the next move in the midst of a panic beyond description.</p>
 <p>"I have already said to you that to be a natural man or a natural woman is a matter of </p>
 <p>positioning the assemblage point," don Juan said. "By natural I mean someone who was </p>
 <p>born either male or female. To a seer, the shiniest part of the assemblage point faces </p>
 <p>outward, in the case of females and inward, in the case of males. The tenant's assemblage </p>
 <p>point was originally facing inward, but he changed it by twisting it around and making </p>
 <p>his egglike energy shape look like a shell that has curled up on itself."</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 12</p>
 <p>THE WOMAN IN THE CHURCH</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Don Juan and I sat in silence. I had run out of questions, and he seemed to have said to </p>
 <p>me all that was pertinent. It could not have been more than seven o'clock, but the plaza </p>
 <p>was unusually deserted. It was a warm night. In the evenings in that town, people usually </p>
 <p>meandered around the plaza until ten or eleven.</p>
 <p>I took a moment to reconsider what was happening to me. My time with don Juan was </p>
 <p>coming to an end. He and his party were going to fulfill the sorcerers' dream of leaving </p>
 <p>this world and entering into inconceivable dimensions. On the basis of my limited </p>
 <p>success in dreaming, I believed that their</p>
 <p>claims were not illusory but extremely sober, although contrary to reason. They were </p>
 <p>seeking to perceive the unknown, and they had made it.</p>
 <p>Don Juan was right in saying that, by inducing a systematic displacement of the </p>
 <p>assemblage point, dreaming liberates perception, enlarging the scope of what can be </p>
 <p>perceived. For the sorcerers of his party, dreaming had not only opened the doors of other </p>
 <p>perceivable worlds but prepared them for entering into those realms in full awareness. </p>
 <p>Dreaming, for them, had be come ineffable, unprecedented, something whose nature and </p>
 <p>scope could only be alluded to, as when don Juan said that it is the gateway to the light </p>
 <p>and to the darkness of the universe.</p>
 <p>There was only one thing pending for them: my encounter with the death defier. I </p>
 <p>regretted that don Juan had not given me notice so that I could prepare myself better. But </p>
 <p>he was a nagual who did everything of importance on the spur of the moment, without </p>
 <p>any warning.</p>
 <p>For a moment, I seemed to be doing fine, sitting with don Juan in that park, waiting for </p>
 <p>things to develop. But then my emotional stability suffered a downward swing and, in the </p>
 <p>twinkling of an eye, I was in the midst of a dark despair. I was assailed by petty </p>
 <p>considerations about my safety, my goals, my hopes in the world, my worries. Upon </p>
 <p>examination, however, I had to admit that perhaps the only true worry I had was about </p>
 <p>my three cohorts in don Juan's world. Yet, if I thought it out, even that was no real worry </p>
 <p>to me. Don Juan had taught them to be the kind of sorceresses who always knew what to </p>
 <p>do, and, most important, he had prepared them always to know what to do with what they </p>
 <p>knew.</p>
 <p>Having had all the possible worldly reasons for feeling anguish stripped off me a long </p>
 <p>time ago, all I had been left with was concern for myself. And I gave myself to it </p>
 <p>shamelessly. One last indulging for the road: the fear of dying at the hands of the death </p>
 <p>defier. I became so afraid that I got sick to my stomach. I tried to apologize, but don Juan </p>
 <p>laughed.</p>
 <p>"You're not in any way unique at barfing out of fear," he said. "When I met the death </p>
 <p>defier, I wet my pants. Believe me."</p>
 <p>I waited in silence for a long, unbearable moment. "Are you ready?" he asked. I said yes. </p>
 <p>And he added, standing up, "Let's go then and find out how you are going to stand up in </p>
 <p>the firing line."</p>
 <p>He led the way back to the church. To the best of my ability, all I remember of that walk, </p>
 <p>to this day, is that he had to drag me bodily the whole way. I do not remember arriving at </p>
 <p>the church or entering it. The next thing I knew, I was kneeling on a long, worn-out </p>
 <p>wooden pew next to the woman I had seen earlier. She was smiling at me. Desperately, I </p>
 <p>looked around, trying to spot don Juan, but he was nowhere in sight. I would have flown </p>
 <p>like a bat out of hell had the woman not restrained me by grabbing my arm.</p>
 <p>"Why should you be so afraid of poor little me?" the woman asked me in English.</p>
 <p>I stayed glued to the spot where I was kneeling. What had taken me entirely and </p>
 <p>instantaneously was her voice. I cannot describe what it was about its raspy sound that </p>
 <p>called out the most recondite memories in me. It was as if I had always known that voice.</p>
 <p>I remained there immobile, mesmerized by that sound. She asked me something else in </p>
 <p>English, but I could not make out what she was saying. She smiled at me, knowingly. </p>
 <p>"It's all right," she whispered in Spanish. She was kneeling to my right. "I understand </p>
 <p>real fear. I live with it."</p>
 <p>I was about to talk to her when I heard the emissary's voice in my ear. "It's the voice of </p>
 <p>Hermelinda, your wet nurse," it said. The only thing I had ever known about Hermelinda </p>
 <p>was the story I was told of her being accidentally killed by a runaway truck. That the </p>
 <p>woman's voice would stir such deep, old memories was shocking to me. I experienced a </p>
 <p>momentary agonizing anxiety</p>
 <p>"I am your wet nurse!" the woman exclaimed softly. "How extraordinary! Do you want </p>
 <p>my breast?" Laughter convulsed her body.</p>
 <p>I made a supreme effort to remain calm, yet I knew that I was quickly losing ground and </p>
 <p>in no time at all was going to take leave of my senses.</p>
 <p>"Don't mind my joking," the woman said in a low voice. "The truth is that I like you very </p>
 <p>much. You are bustling with energy. And we are going to get along fine."</p>
 <p>Two older men knelt down right in front of us. One of them turned curiously to look at </p>
 <p>us. She paid no attention to him and kept on whispering in my ear.</p>
 <p>"Let me hold your hand," she pleaded. But her plea was like a command. I surrendered </p>
 <p>my hand to her, unable to say no. "Thank you. Thank you for your confidence and your </p>
 <p>trust in me," she whispered.</p>
 <p>The sound of her voice was driving me mad. Its raspiness was so exotic, so utterly </p>
 <p>feminine. Not under any circumstances would I have taken it for a man's voice laboring </p>
 <p>to sound womanly. It was a raspy voice, but not a throaty or harsh-sounding one. It was </p>
 <p>more like the sound of bare feet softly walking on gravel.</p>
 <p>I made a tremendous effort to break an invisible sheet of energy that seemed to have </p>
 <p>enveloped me. I thought I succeeded. I stood up, ready to leave, and I would have had not </p>
 <p>the woman also stood up and whispered in my ear, "Don't run away. There is so much I </p>
 <p>have to tell you."</p>
 <p>I automatically sat down, stopped by curiosity. Strangely, my anxiety was suddenly gone, </p>
 <p>and so was my fear. I even had enough presence to ask the woman, "Are you really a </p>
 <p>woman?"</p>
 <p>She chuckled softly, like a young girl. Then she voiced a convoluted sentence. "If you </p>
 <p>dare to think that I would transform myself into a fearsome man and cause you harm, you </p>
 <p>are gravely mistaken," she said, accentuating even more that strange, mesmeric voice. </p>
 <p>"You are my benefactor. I am your servant, as I have been the servant of all the naguals </p>
 <p>who preceded you."</p>
 <p>Gathering all the energy I could, I spoke my mind to her. "You are welcome to my </p>
 <p>energy" I said. "It's a gift from me to you, but I don't want any gifts of power from you. </p>
 <p>And I really mean this."</p>
 <p>"I can't take your energy for free," she whispered. "I pay for what I get, that's the deal. </p>
 <p>It's foolish to give your energy for free."</p>
 <p>"I've been a fool all my life. Believe me," I said. "I can surely afford to make you a gift. I </p>
 <p>have no problem with it. You need the energy, take it. But I don't need to be saddled with </p>
 <p>unnecessaries. I have nothing and I love it."</p>
 <p>"Perhaps," she said pensively.</p>
 <p>Aggressively, I asked her whether she meant that perhaps she would take my energy or </p>
 <p>that she did not believe I had nothing and loved it.</p>
 <p>She giggled with delight and said that she might take my energy since I was so </p>
 <p>generously offering it but that she had to make a payment. She had to give me a thing of </p>
 <p>similar value.</p>
 <p>As I heard her speak, I became aware that she spoke Spanish with a most extravagant </p>
 <p>foreign accent. She added an extra phoneme to the middle syllable of every word. Never </p>
 <p>in my life had I heard anyone speak like that.</p>
 <p>"Your accent is quite extraordinary," I said. "Where is it from?"</p>
 <p>"From nearly eternity" she said and sighed.</p>
 <p>We had begun to connect. I understood why she sighed. She was the closest thing to </p>
 <p>permanent, while I was temporary That was my advantage. The death defier had worked </p>
 <p>herself into a corner, and I was free.</p>
 <p>I examined her closely. She seemed to be between thirty-five and forty years old. She </p>
 <p>was a dark, thoroughly Indian woman, almost husky, but not fat or even hefty. I could see </p>
 <p>that the skin of her forearms and hands was smooth, the muscles, firm and youthful. I </p>
 <p>judged that she was five feet, six or seven inches tall. She wore a long dress, a black </p>
 <p>shawl, and guaraches. In her kneeling position, I could also see her smooth heels and part </p>
 <p>of her powerful calves. Her midsection was lean. She had big breasts that she could not or </p>
 <p>perhaps did not want to hide under her shawl. Her hair was jet black and tied in a long </p>
 <p>braid. She was not beautiful, but she was not homely either. Her features were in no way </p>
 <p>outstanding. I felt that she could not possibly have attracted anybody's attention, except </p>
 <p>for her eyes, which she kept low, hidden beneath downcast eyelids. Her eyes were </p>
 <p>magnificent, clear, peaceful. Apart from don Juan's, I had never seen eyes more brilliant, </p>
 <p>more alive.</p>
 <p>Her eyes put me completely at ease. Eyes like that could not be malevolent. I had a surge </p>
 <p>of trust and optimism and the feeling that I had known her all my life. But I was also very </p>
 <p>conscious of something else: my emotional instability. It had always plagued me in don </p>
 <p>Juan's world, forcing me to be like a yo-yo. I had moments of total trust and insight only </p>
 <p>to be followed by abject doubts and distrust. This event was not going to be different. My </p>
 <p>suspicious mind suddenly came up with the warning thought that I was falling under the </p>
 <p>woman's spell.</p>
 <p>"You learned Spanish late in life, didn't you?" I said, just to get out from under my </p>
 <p>thoughts and to avoid her reading them.</p>
 <p>"Only yesterday," she retorted and broke into a crystalline laughter, her small, strangely </p>
 <p>white teeth, shining like a row of pearls.</p>
 <p>People turned to look at us. I lowered my forehead as if in deep prayer. The woman </p>
 <p>moved closer to me.</p>
 <p>"Is there a place where we could talk?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"We are talking here," she said. "I have talked here with all the naguals of your line. If </p>
 <p>you whisper, no one will know we are talking."</p>
 <p>I was dying to ask her about her age. But a sobering memory came to my rescue. I </p>
 <p>remembered a friend of mine who for years had been setting up all kinds of traps to make </p>
 <p>me confess my age to him. I detested his petty concern, and now I was about to engage in </p>
 <p>the same behavior. I dropped it instantly.</p>
 <p>I wanted to tell her about it, just to keep the conversation going. She seemed to know </p>
 <p>what was going through my mind. She squeezed my arm in a friendly gesture, as if to say </p>
 <p>that we had shared a thought.</p>
 <p>"Instead of giving me a gift, can you tell me something that would help me in my way?" I </p>
 <p>asked her.</p>
 <p>She shook her head. "No," she whispered. "We are extremely different. More different </p>
 <p>than I believed possible."</p>
 <p>She got up and slid sideways out of the pew. She deftly genuflected as she faced the main </p>
 <p>altar. She crossed herself and signaled me to follow her to a large side altar to our left.</p>
 <p>We knelt in front of a life-size crucifix. Before I had time to say anything, she spoke. </p>
 <p>"I've been alive for a very, very long time," she said. "The reason I have had this long </p>
 <p>life is that I control the shifts and movements of my assemblage point. Also, I don't stay </p>
 <p>here in your world too long. I have to save the energy I get from the naguals of your </p>
 <p>line."</p>
 <p>"What is it like to exist in other worlds?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"It's like in your dreaming, except that I have more mobility And I can stay longer </p>
 <p>anywhere I want. Just like if you would stay as long as you wanted in any of your </p>
 <p>dreams."</p>
 <p>"When you are in this world, are you pinned down to this area alone?"</p>
 <p>"No. I go everywhere I want."</p>
 <p>"Do you always go as a woman?" 7</p>
 <p>"I've been a woman longer than a man. Definitely, I like it much better. I think I've </p>
 <p>nearly forgotten how to be a man. I am all female!"</p>
 <p>She took my hand and made me touch her crotch. My heart was pounding in my throat. </p>
 <p>She was indeed a female.</p>
 <p>"I can't just take your energy," she said, changing the subject. "We have to strike another </p>
 <p>kind of agreement."</p>
 <p>Another wave of mundane reasoning hit me then. I wanted to ask her where she lived </p>
 <p>when she was in this world. I did not need to voice my question to get an answer.</p>
 <p>"You're much, much younger than I," she said, "and you already have difficulty telling </p>
 <p>people where you live. And even if you take them to the house you own or pay rent on, </p>
 <p>that's not where you live."</p>
 <p>"There are so many things I want to ask you, but all I do is think stupid thoughts," I said.</p>
 <p>"You don't need to ask me anything," she went on. "You already know what I know. All </p>
 <p>you needed was a jolt in order to claim what you already know. I am giving you that </p>
 <p>jolt."</p>
 <p>Not only did I think stupid thoughts but I was in a state of such suggestibility that no </p>
 <p>sooner had she finished saying that I knew what she knew than I felt I knew everything, </p>
 <p>and I no longer needed to ask any more questions. Laughingly, I told her about my </p>
 <p>gullibility.</p>
 <p>"You're not gullible," she assured me with authority "You know everything, because </p>
 <p>you're now totally in the second attention. Look around!"</p>
 <p>For a moment, I could not focus my sight. It was exactly as if water had gotten into my </p>
 <p>eyes. When I arranged my view, I knew that something portentous had happened. The </p>
 <p>church was different, darker, more ominous, and somehow harder. I stood up and took a </p>
 <p>couple of steps toward the nave. What caught my eye were the pews; they were made not </p>
 <p>out of lumber but out of thin, twisted poles. These were homemade pews, set inside a </p>
 <p>magnificent stone building. Also, the light in the church was different. It was yellowish, </p>
 <p>and its dim glow cast the blackest shadows I had ever seen. It came from the candles of </p>
 <p>the many altars. I had an insight about how well candlelight mixed with the massive stone </p>
 <p>walls and ornaments of a colonial church.</p>
 <p>The woman was staring at me; the brightness of her eyes was most remarkable. I knew </p>
 <p>then that I was dreaming and she was directing the dream. But I was not afraid of her or </p>
 <p>of the dream.</p>
 <p>I moved away from the side altar and looked again at the nave of the church. There were </p>
 <p>people kneeling in prayer there.</p>
 <p>Lots of them, strangely small, dark, hard people. I could see their bowed heads all the </p>
 <p>way to the foot of the main altar. The ones who were close to me stared at me, obviously, </p>
 <p>in disapproval. I was gaping at them and at everything else. I could not hear any noise, </p>
 <p>though. People moved, but there was no sound.</p>
 <p>"I can't hear anything," I said to the woman, and my voice boomed, echoing as if the </p>
 <p>church were a hollow shell.</p>
 <p>Nearly all the heads turned to look at me. The woman pulled. me back into the darkness </p>
 <p>of the side altar.</p>
 <p>"You will hear if you don't listen with your ears," she said. "Listen with your dreaming </p>
 <p>attention."</p>
 <p>It appeared that all I needed was her insinuation. I was suddenly flooded by the droning </p>
 <p>sound of a multitude in prayer. I was instantly swept up by it. I found it the most </p>
 <p>exquisite sound I had ever heard. I wanted to rave about it to the woman, but she was not </p>
 <p>by my side. I looked for her. She had nearly reached the door. She turned there to signal </p>
 <p>me to follow her.. I caught up with her at the portico. The streetlights were gone. The </p>
 <p>only illumination was moonlight. The facade of the church was also different; it was </p>
 <p>unfinished Square blocks of limestone lay everywhere. There were no houses or </p>
 <p>buildings around the church. In the moonlight the scene was eerie.</p>
 <p>"Where are we going?" I asked her.</p>
 <p>"Nowhere," she replied. "We simply came out here to have more space, more privacy. </p>
 <p>Here we can talk our little heads off."</p>
 <p>She urged me to sit down on a quarried, half-chiseled piece of limestone. "The second </p>
 <p>attention has endless treasures to be discovered," she began. "The initial position in </p>
 <p>which the dreamer places his body is of key importance. And right there is the secret of </p>
 <p>the ancient sorcerers, who were already ancient in my time. Think about it."</p>
 <p>She sat so close to me that I felt the heat of her body. She put an arm around my shoulder </p>
 <p>and pressed me against her bosom. Her body had a most peculiar fragrance; it reminded </p>
 <p>me of trees or sage. It was not that she was wearing perfume; her whole being seemed to </p>
 <p>exude that characteristic odor of pine forests. Also the heat of her body was not like mine </p>
 <p>or like that of anyone else I knew. Hers was a cool, mentholated heat, even, balanced. </p>
 <p>The thought that came to my mind was that her heat would press on relentlessly but knew </p>
 <p>no hurry.</p>
 <p>She began then to whisper in my left ear. She said that the gifts she had given to the </p>
 <p>naguals of my line had to do with what the old sorcerers used to call the twin positions. </p>
 <p>That is to say, the initial position in which a dreamer holds his physical body to begin </p>
 <p>dreaming is mirrored by the position in which he holds his energy body, in dreams, to </p>
 <p>fixate his assemblage point on any spot of his choosing. The two positions make a unit, </p>
 <p>she said, and it took the old sorcerers thousands of years to find out the perfect </p>
 <p>relationship between any two positions. She commented, with a giggle, that the sorcerers </p>
 <p>of today will never have the time or the disposition to do all that work, and. that the men </p>
 <p>and women of my line were indeed lucky to have her to give them such gifts. Her </p>
 <p>laughter had a most remarkable, crystalline sound.</p>
 <p>I had not quite understood her explanation of the twin positions. Boldly, I told her that I </p>
 <p>did not want to practice those things but only know about them as intellectual </p>
 <p>possibilities.</p>
 <p>"What exactly do you want to know?" she asked softly.</p>
 <p>"Explain to me what you mean by the twin positions, or the initial position in which a </p>
 <p>dreamer holds his body to start dreaming." I said.</p>
 <p>"How do you lie down to start your dreaming?" she asked.</p>
 <p>"Any which way. I don't have a pattern. Don Juan never stressed this point."</p>
 <p>"Well, I do stress it," she said and stood up.</p>
 <p>She changed positions. She sat down to my right and whispered in my other ear that, in </p>
 <p>accordance with what she knew, the position in which one places the body is of utmost </p>
 <p>importance. She proposed a way of testing this by performing an extremely delicate but </p>
 <p>simple exercise.</p>
 <p>"Start your dreaming by lying on your right side, with your knees a bit bent," she said. </p>
 <p>"The discipline is to maintain that position and fall asleep in it. In dreaming, then, the </p>
 <p>exercise is to dream that you lie down in exactly the same position and fall asleep again."</p>
 <p>"What does that do?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"It makes the assemblage point stay put, and I mean really stay put, in whatever position </p>
 <p>it is at the instant of that second falling asleep."</p>
 <p>"What are the results of this exercise?"</p>
 <p>"Total perception. I am sure your teachers have already told you that my gifts are gifts of </p>
 <p>total perception."</p>
 <p>"Yes. But I think I am not clear about what total perception means," I lied.</p>
 <p>She ignored me and went on to tell me that the four variations of the exercise were to fall </p>
 <p>asleep lying on the right side, the left, the back, and the stomach. Then in dreaming the </p>
 <p>exercise was to dream of falling asleep a second time in the same position as the </p>
 <p>dreaming had been started. She promised me extraordinary results, which she said were </p>
 <p>not possible to foretell.</p>
 <p>She abruptly changed the subject and asked me, "What's the gift you want for yourself?"</p>
 <p>"No gift for me. I've told you that already."</p>
 <p>"I insist. I must offer you a gift, and you must accept it. That is our agreement."</p>
 <p>"Our agreement is that we give you energy. So take it from me. This one is on me. My </p>
 <p>gift to you."</p>
 <p>The woman seemed dumbfounded. And I persisted in telling her it was all right with me </p>
 <p>that she took my energy. I even told her that I liked her immensely. Naturally, I meant it. </p>
 <p>There was something supremely sad and, at the same time, supremely appealing about </p>
 <p>her.</p>
 <p>"Let's go back inside the church," she muttered.</p>
 <p>"If you really want to make me a gift," I said, "take me for a stroll in this town, in the </p>
 <p>moonlight."</p>
 <p>She shook her head affirmatively. "Provided that you don't say a word," she said.</p>
 <p>"Why not?" I asked, but I already knew the answer.</p>
 <p>"Because we are dreaming," she said. "I'll be taking you deeper into my dream."</p>
 <p>She explained that as long as we stayed in the church, I had enough energy to think and </p>
 <p>converse, but that beyond the boundaries of that church it was a different situation.</p>
 <p>"Why is that?" I asked daringly.</p>
 <p>In a most serious tone, which not only increased her eeriness but terrified me, the woman </p>
 <p>said, "Because there is no out there. This is a dream. You are at the fourth gate of </p>
 <p>dreaming, dreaming my dream."</p>
 <p>She told me that her art was to be capable of projecting her intent, and that everything I </p>
 <p>saw around me was her intent. She said in a whisper that the church and the town were </p>
 <p>the results of her intent; they did not exist, yet they did. She added, looking into my eyes, </p>
 <p>that this is one of the mysteries of intending in the second attention the twin positions of </p>
 <p>dreaming. It can be done, but it cannot be explained or comprehended.</p>
 <p>She told me then that she came from a line of sorcerers who knew how to move about in </p>
 <p>the second attention by projecting their intent. Her story was that the sorcerers of her line </p>
 <p>practiced the art of projecting their thoughts in dreaming in order to accomplish the </p>
 <p>truthful reproduction of any object or structure or landmark or scenery of their choice.</p>
 <p>She said that the sorcerers of her line used to start by gazing at a simple object and </p>
 <p>memorizing every detail of it. They would then close their eyes and visualize the object </p>
 <p>and correct their visualization against the true object until they could see it, in its </p>
 <p>completeness, with their eyes shut.</p>
 <p>The next thing in their developing scheme was to dream with the object and create in the </p>
 <p>dream, from the point of view of their own perception, a total materialization of the </p>
 <p>object. This act, the woman said, was called the first step to total perception.</p>
 <p>From a simple object, those sorcerers went on to take more and more complex items. </p>
 <p>Their final aim was for all of them together to visualize a total world, then dream that </p>
 <p>world and thus re-create a totally veritable realm where they could exist.</p>
 <p>"When any of the sorcerers of my line were able to do that," the woman went on, "they </p>
 <p>could easily pull anyone into their intent, into their dream. This is what I am doing to you </p>
 <p>now, and what I did to all the naguals of your line."</p>
 <p>The woman giggled. "You better believe it," she said, as if I did not. "Whole populations </p>
 <p>disappeared dreaming like that. This is the reason I said to you that this church and this </p>
 <p>town are one of the mysteries of intending in the second attention."</p>
 <p>"You say that whole populations disappeared that way. How was it possible?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"They visualized and then re-created in dreaming the same scenery," she replied. </p>
 <p>"You've never visualized anything, so it's very dangerous for you to go into my dream."</p>
 <p>She warned me, then, that to cross the fourth gate and travel to places that exist only in </p>
 <p>someone else's intent was perilous, since every item in such a dream had to be an </p>
 <p>ultimately personal item.</p>
 <p>"Do you still want to go?" she asked.</p>
 <p>I said yes. Then she told me more about the twin positions. The essence of her </p>
 <p>explanation was that if I were, for instance, dreaming of my hometown and my dream </p>
 <p>had started when I lay down on my right side, I could very easily stay in the town of my </p>
 <p>dream if I would lie on my right side, in the dream, and dream that I had fallen asleep. </p>
 <p>The second dream not only would necessarily be a dream of my hometown, but would be </p>
 <p>the most concrete dream one can imagine.</p>
 <p>She was confident that in my dreaming training I had gotten countless dreams of great </p>
 <p>concreteness, but she assured me that every one of them had to be a fluke. For the only </p>
 <p>way to have absolute control of dreams was to use the technique of the twin positions.</p>
 <p>"And don't ask me why," she added. "It just happens. Like everything else."</p>
 <p>She made me stand up and admonished me again not to talk or stray from her. She took </p>
 <p>my hand gently, as if I were a child, and headed toward a clump of dark silhouettes of </p>
 <p>houses. We were on a cobbled street. Hard river rocks had been pounded edgewise into </p>
 <p>the dirt. Uneven pressure had created uneven surfaces. It seemed that the cobblers had </p>
 <p>followed the contours of the ground without bothering to level it.</p>
 <p>The houses were big, whitewashed, one-story dusty buildings with tiled roofs. There </p>
 <p>were people meandering quietly. Dark shadows inside the houses gave me the feeling of </p>
 <p>curious but frightened neighbors gossiping behind doors. I could also see the flat </p>
 <p>mountains around the town.</p>
 <p>Contrary to what had happened to me all along in my dreaming, my mental processes </p>
 <p>were unimpaired. My thoughts were not pushed away by the force of the events in the </p>
 <p>dream. And my mental calculations told me I was in the dream version of the town where </p>
 <p>don Juan lived, but at a different time. My curiosity was at its peak. I was actually with </p>
 <p>the death defier in her dream. But was it a dream? She herself had said it was a dream. I </p>
 <p>wanted to watch everything, to be superalert. I wanted to test everything by seeing </p>
 <p>energy. I felt embarrassed, but the woman tightened her grip on my hand as if to signal </p>
 <p>me that she agreed with me.</p>
 <p>Still feeling absurdly bashful, I automatically stated out loud my intent to see. In my </p>
 <p>dreaming practices, I had been using all along the phrase "I want to see energy </p>
 <p>Sometimes, I had to say it over and over until I got results. This time, in the woman's </p>
 <p>dream town, as I began to repeat it in my usual manner, the woman began to laugh. Her </p>
 <p>laughter was like don Juan's: a deep, abandoned belly laugh.</p>
 <p>"What's so funny?" I asked, somehow contaminated by her mirth.</p>
 <p>"Juan Matus doesn't like the old sorcerers in general and me in particular," the woman </p>
 <p>said between fits of laughter. "All we have to do, in order to see in our dreams, is to point </p>
 <p>with our little finger at the item we want to see. To make you yell in my dream is his way </p>
 <p>to send me his message. You have to admit that he's really clever." She paused for a </p>
 <p>moment, then said in the tone of a revelation, "Of course, to yell like an asshole works </p>
 <p>too."</p>
 <p>The sorcerers' sense of humor bewildered me beyond measure. She laughed so hard she </p>
 <p>seemed to be unable to proceed with our walk. I felt stupid. When she calmed down and </p>
 <p>was perfectly poised again, she politely told me that I could point at anything I wanted in </p>
 <p>her dream, including herself.</p>
 <p>I pointed at a house with the little finger of my left hand. There was no energy in that </p>
 <p>house. The house was like any other item of a regular dream. I pointed at everything </p>
 <p>around me with the same result.</p>
 <p>"Point at me," she urged me. "You must corroborate that this is the method dreamers </p>
 <p>follow in order to see."</p>
 <p>She was thoroughly right. That was the method. The instant I pointed my finger at her, </p>
 <p>she was a blob of energy A very peculiar blob of energy, I may add. Her energetic shape </p>
 <p>was exactly as don Juan had described it; it looked like an enormous seashell, curled </p>
 <p>inwardly along a cleavage that ran its length.</p>
 <p>"I am the only energy-generating being in this dream," she said. "So the proper thing for </p>
 <p>you to do is just watch everything."</p>
 <p>At that moment I was struck, for the first time, by the immensity of don Juan's joke. He </p>
 <p>had actually contrived to have me learn to yell in my dreaming so that I could yell in the </p>
 <p>privacy of the death defier's dream. I found that touch so funny that laughter spilled out </p>
 <p>of me in suffocating waves.</p>
 <p>"Let's continue our walk," the woman said softly when I had no more laughter in me.</p>
 <p>There were only two streets that intersected; each had three blocks of houses. We walked </p>
 <p>the length of both streets, not once but four times. I looked at everything and listened </p>
 <p>with my dreaming attention for any noises. There were very few, only dogs barking in the </p>
 <p>distance, or people speaking in whispers as we went by.</p>
 <p>The dogs barking brought me an unknown and profound longing. I had to stop walking. I </p>
 <p>sought relief by leaning my shoulder against a wall. The contact with the wall was </p>
 <p>shocking to me, not because the wall was unusual but because what I had leaned on was a </p>
 <p>solid wall, like any other wall I had ever touched. I felt it with my free hand. I ran my </p>
 <p>fingers on its rough surface. It was indeed a wall!</p>
 <p>Its stunning realness put an immediate end to my longing and renewed my interest in </p>
 <p>watching everything. I was looking, specifically, for features that could be correlated </p>
 <p>with the town of my day. However, no matter how intently I observed, I had no success. </p>
 <p>There was a plaza in that town, but it was in front of the church, facing the portico.</p>
 <p>In the moonlight the mountains around the town were clearly visible and almost </p>
 <p>recognizable. I tried to orient myself, observing the moon and the stars, as if I were in the </p>
 <p>consensual reality of everyday life. It was a waning moon, perhaps a day after full. It was </p>
 <p>high over the horizon. It must have been between eight and nine in the evening. I could </p>
 <p>see Orion to the right of the moon; its two main stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel, were on a </p>
 <p>horizontal straight line with the moon. I estimated it to be early December. My time was </p>
 <p>May. In May, Orion is nowhere in sight at that time. I gazed at the moon as long as I </p>
 <p>could. Nothing shifted. It was the moon as far as I could tell. The disparity in time got me </p>
 <p>very excited.</p>
 <p>As I reexamined the southern horizon, I thought I could distinguish the bell-like peak </p>
 <p>visible from don Juan's patio. I tried next to figure out where his house might have been. </p>
 <p>For one instant I thought I found it. I became so enthralled that I pulled my hand out of </p>
 <p>the woman's grip. Instantly, a tremendous anxiety possessed me. I knew that I had to go </p>
 <p>back to the church, because if I did not I would simply drop dead on the spot. I turned </p>
 <p>around and bolted for the church. The woman quickly grabbed my hand and followed me.</p>
 <p>As we approached the church at a running pace, I became aware that the town in that </p>
 <p>dreaming was behind the church. Had I taken this into consideration, orientation might </p>
 <p>have been possible. As it was, I had no more dreaming attention. I focused all of it on the </p>
 <p>architectural and ornamental details on the back of the church. I had never seen that part </p>
 <p>of the building in the world of everyday life, and I thought that if I could record its </p>
 <p>features in my memory, I could check them later against the details of the real church.</p>
 <p>That was the plan I concocted on the spur of the moment. Something inside me, however, </p>
 <p>scorned my efforts at validation. During all my apprenticeship, I had been plagued by the </p>
 <p>need for objectivity, which had forced me to check and recheck everything about don </p>
 <p>Juan's world. Yet it was not validation per se that was always at stake but the need to use </p>
 <p>this drive for objectivity as a crutch to give me protection at the moments of most intense </p>
 <p>cognitive disruption; when it was time to check what I had validated, I never went </p>
 <p>through with it.</p>
 <p>Inside the church, the woman and I knelt in front of the small altar on the left side, where </p>
 <p>we had been, and the next instant, I woke up in the well-illuminated church of my day.</p>
 <p>The woman crossed herself and stood up. I did the same automatically. She took my arm </p>
 <p>and began to walk toward the door.</p>
 <p>"Wait, wait," I said and was surprised that I could talk. I could not think clearly, yet I </p>
 <p>wanted to ask her a convoluted question. What I wanted to know was how anyone could </p>
 <p>have the energy to visualize every detail of a whole town.</p>
 <p>Smiling, the woman answered my unvoiced question; she said that she was very good at </p>
 <p>visualizing because after a lifetime of doing it, she had many, many lifetimes to perfect it. </p>
 <p>She added that the town I had visited and the church where we had talked were examples </p>
 <p>of her recent visualizations. The church was the same church where Sebastian had been a </p>
 <p>sexton. She had given herself the task of memorizing every detail of every corner of that </p>
 <p>church and that town, for that matter, out of a need to survive.</p>
 <p>She ended her talk with a most disturbing afterthought. "Since you know quite a bit about </p>
 <p>this town, even though you've never tried to visualize it," she said, "you are now helping </p>
 <p>me to intend it. I bet you won't believe me if I tell you that this town you are looking at </p>
 <p>now doesn't really exist, outside your intent and mine."</p>
 <p>She peered at me and laughed at my sense of horror, for I had just fully realized what she </p>
 <p>was saying. "Are we still dreaming?" I asked, astonished.</p>
 <p>"We are," she said. "But this dreaming is more real than the other, because you're </p>
 <p>helping me. It is not possible to explain it beyond saying that it is happening. Like </p>
 <p>everything else." She pointed all around her. "There is no way to tell how it happens, but </p>
 <p>it does. Remember always what I've told you: this is the mystery of intending in the </p>
 <p>second attention."</p>
 <p>She gently pulled me closer to her. "Let's stroll to the plaza of this dream," she said. "But </p>
 <p>perhaps I should fix myself a little bit so you'll be more at ease."</p>
 <p>I looked at her uncomprehendingly as she expertly changed her appearance. She did this </p>
 <p>with very simple, mundane maneuvers. She undid her long skirt, revealing the very </p>
 <p>average midcalf skirt she was wearing underneath. She then twisted her long braid into a </p>
 <p>chignon and changed from her guaraches into inch-heel shoes she had in a small cloth </p>
 <p>sack.</p>
 <p>She turned over her reversible black shawl to reveal a beige stole. She looked like a </p>
 <p>typical middle-class Mexican woman from the city, perhaps on a visit to that town.</p>
 <p>She took my arm with a woman's aplomb and led the way to the plaza.</p>
 <p>"What happened to your tongue?" she said in English. "Did the cat eat it?"</p>
 <p>I was totally engrossed in the unthinkable possibility that I was still in a dream; what is </p>
 <p>more, I was beginning to believe that if it were true, I ran the risk of never waking up.</p>
 <p>In a nonchalant tone that I could not recognize as mine, I said, "I didn't realize until now </p>
 <p>that you spoke in English to me before. Where did you learn it?"</p>
 <p>"In the world out there. I speak many languages." She paused and scrutinized me. "I've </p>
 <p>had plenty of time to learn them. Since we're going to spend a lot of time together, I'll </p>
 <p>teach you my own language sometime." She giggled, no doubt at my look of despair.</p>
 <p>I stopped walking. "Are we going to spend a lot of time together?" I asked, betraying my </p>
 <p>feelings.</p>
 <p>"Of course," she replied in a joyful tone. "You are, and I should say very generously, </p>
 <p>going to give me your energy for free. You said that yourself, didn't you?"</p>
 <p>I was aghast.</p>
 <p>"What's the problem?" the woman asked, shifting back into Spanish. "Don't tell me that </p>
 <p>you regret your decision. We are sorcerers. It's too late to change your mind. You are not </p>
 <p>afraid, are you?"</p>
 <p>I was again more than terrified, but, if I had been put on the spot to describe what </p>
 <p>terrified me, I would not have known. I was certainly not afraid of being with the death </p>
 <p>defier in another dream or of losing my mind or even my life. Was I afraid of evil? I </p>
 <p>asked myself. But the thought of evil could not withstand examination. As a result of all </p>
 <p>those years on the sorcerers' path, I knew without the shadow of a doubt that in the </p>
 <p>universe only energy exists; evil is merely a concatenation of the human mind, </p>
 <p>overwhelmed by the fixation of the assemblage point on its habitual position. Logically, </p>
 <p>there was really nothing for me to be afraid of. I knew that, but I also knew that my real </p>
 <p>weakness was to lack the fluidity to fix my assemblage point instantly on any new </p>
 <p>position to which it was displaced. The contact with the death defier was displacing my </p>
 <p>assemblage point at a tremendous rate, and I did not have the prowess to keep up with the </p>
 <p>push. The end result was a vague pseudo-sensation of fearing that I might not be able to </p>
 <p>wake up.</p>
 <p>"There is no problem," I said. "Let's continue our dream walk."</p>
 <p>She linked her arm with mine, and we reached the park in silence. It was not at all a </p>
 <p>forced silence. But my mind was running in circles. How strange, I thought; only a while </p>
 <p>ago I had walked with don Juan from the park to the church, in the midst of the most </p>
 <p>terrifying normal fear. Now I was walking back from the church to the park with the </p>
 <p>object of my fear, and I was more terrified than ever, but in a different, more mature, </p>
 <p>more deadly manner.</p>
 <p>To fend off my worries, I began to look around. If this was a dream, as I believed it was, </p>
 <p>there was a way to prove or disprove it. I pointed my finger at the houses, at the church, </p>
 <p>at the pavement in the street. I pointed at people. I pointed at every thing. Daringly, I </p>
 <p>even grabbed a couple of people, whom I seemed to scare considerably. I felt their mass. </p>
 <p>They were as real as anything I consider real, except that they did not generate energy. </p>
 <p>Nothing in that town generated energy Everything seemed real and normal, yet it was a </p>
 <p>dream.</p>
 <p>I turned to the woman, who was holding on to my arm, and questioned her about it.</p>
 <p>"We are dreaming," she said in her raspy voice and giggled.</p>
 <p>"But how can people and things around us to be so real, so three-dimensional?"</p>
 <p>"The mystery of intending in the second attention!" she exclaimed reverently. "Those </p>
 <p>people out there are so real that they even have thoughts."</p>
 <p>That was the last stroke. I did not want to question anything else. I wanted to abandon </p>
 <p>myself to that dream. A considerable jolt on my arm brought me back to the moment. We </p>
 <p>had reached the plaza. The woman had stopped walking and was pulling me to sit down </p>
 <p>on a bench. I knew I was in trouble when I did not feel the bench underneath me as I sat </p>
 <p>down. I began to spin. I thought I was ascending. I caught a most fleeting glimpse of the </p>
 <p>park, as if I were looking at it from above.</p>
 <p>"This is it!" I yelled. I thought I was dying. The spinning ascension turned into a twirling </p>
 <p>descent into blackness.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
 <p>FLYING ON THE WINGS OF INTENT</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>Make an effort, nagual," a woman's voice urged me. "Don't sink. Surface, surface. Use </p>
 <p>your dreaming techniques!"</p>
 <p>My mind began to work. I thought it was the voice of an English speaker, and I also </p>
 <p>thought that if I were to use dreaming techniques, I had to find a point of departure to </p>
 <p>energize myself.</p>
 <p>"Open your eyes," the voice said. "Open them now. Use the first thing you see as a point </p>
 <p>of departure."</p>
 <p>I made a supreme effort and opened my eyes. I saw trees and blue sky. It was daytime! A </p>
 <p>blurry face was peering at me. But I could not focus my eyes. I thought that it was the </p>
 <p>woman in the church looking at me.</p>
 <p>"Use my face," the voice said. It was a familiar voice, but I could not identify it. "Make </p>
 <p>my face your home base; then look at everything," the voice went on.</p>
 <p>My ears were clearing up, and so were my eyes. I gazed at the woman's face, then at the </p>
 <p>trees in the park, at the wrought-iron bench, at people walking by, and back again at her </p>
 <p>face.</p>
 <p>In spite of the fact that her face changed every time I gazed at her, I began to experience a </p>
 <p>minimum of control. When I was more in possession of my faculties, I realized that a </p>
 <p>woman was sitting on the bench, holding my head on her lap. And she was not the </p>
 <p>woman in the church; she was Carol Tiggs.</p>
 <p>"What are you doing here?" I gasped.</p>
 <p>My fright and surprise were so intense that I wanted to jump up and run, but my body </p>
 <p>was not ruled at all by my mental awareness. Anguishing moments followed, in which I </p>
 <p>tried desperately but uselessly to get up. The world around me was too clear for me to </p>
 <p>believe I was still dreaming, yet my impaired motor control made me suspect that this </p>
 <p>was really a dream. Besides, Carol's presence was too abrupt; there were no antecedents </p>
 <p>to justify it.</p>
 <p>Cautiously, I attempted to will myself to get up, as I had done hundreds of times in </p>
 <p>dreaming, but nothing happened. If I ever needed to be objective, this was the time. As </p>
 <p>carefully as I could, I began to look at everything within my field of vision with one eye </p>
 <p>first. I repeated the process with the other eye. I took the consistency between the images </p>
 <p>of my two eyes as an indication that I was in the consensual reality of everyday life.</p>
 <p>Next, I examined Carol. I noticed at that moment that I could move my arms. It was only </p>
 <p>my lower body that was veritably paralyzed. I touched Carol's face and hands; I </p>
 <p>embraced her. She was solid and, I believed, the real Carol Tiggs. My relief was </p>
 <p>enormous, because for a moment I'd had the dark suspicion that she was the death defier </p>
 <p>masquerading as Carol.</p>
 <p>With utmost care, Carol helped me to sit up on the bench. I had been sprawled on my </p>
 <p>back, half on the bench and half on the ground. I noticed then something totally out of the </p>
 <p>norm. I was wearing faded blue Levi's and worn brown leather boots. I also had on a </p>
 <p>Levi's jacket and a denim shirt.</p>
 <p>"Wait a minute," I said to Carol. "Look at me! Are these my clothes? Am I myself?"</p>
 <p>Carol laughed and shook me by the shoulders, the way she always did to denote </p>
 <p>camaraderie, manliness, that she was one of the boys.</p>
 <p>"I'm looking at your beautiful self," she said in her funny forced falsetto. "Oh massa, </p>
 <p>who else could it possibly be?"</p>
 <p>"How in the hell can I be wearing Levi's and boots?" I insisted. "I don't own any."</p>
 <p>"Those are my clothes you are wearing. I found you naked!"</p>
 <p>"Where? When?"</p>
 <p>"Around the church, about an hour ago. I came to the plaza here to look for you. The </p>
 <p>nagual sent me to see if I could find you. I brought the clothes, just in case."</p>
 <p>I told her that I felt terribly vulnerable and embarrassed to have wandered around without </p>
 <p>my clothes.</p>
 <p>"Strangely enough, there was no one around," she assured me, but I felt she was saying it </p>
 <p>just to ease my discomfort. Her playful smile told me so.</p>
 <p>"I must have been with the death defier all last night, maybe even longer," I said. "What </p>
 <p>day is it today?"</p>
 <p>"Don't worry about dates," she said, laughing. "When you are more centered, you'll </p>
 <p>count the days yourself."</p>
 <p>"Don't humor me, Carol Tiggs. What day is it today?" My voice was a gruff, no-</p>
 <p>nonsense voice that did not seem to belong to me.</p>
 <p>"It's the day after the big fiesta," she said and slapped me gently on my shoulder. "We all </p>
 <p>have been looking for you since last night."</p>
 <p>"But what am I doing here?"</p>
 <p>"I took you to the hotel across the plaza. I couldn't carry you all the way to the nagual's </p>
 <p>house; you ran out of the room a few minutes ago, and we ended up here."</p>
 <p>"Why didn't you ask the nagual for help?"</p>
 <p>"Because this is an affair that concerns only you and me. We must solve it together."</p>
 <p>That shut me up. She made perfect sense to me. I asked her one more nagging question. </p>
 <p>"What did I say when you found me?"</p>
 <p>"You said that you had been so deeply into the second attention and for such a long time </p>
 <p>that you were not quite rational yet. All you wanted to do was to fall asleep."</p>
 <p>"When did I lose my motor control?"</p>
 <p>"Only a moment ago. You'll get it back. You yourself know that it is quite normal, when </p>
 <p>you enter into the second attention and receive a considerable energy jolt, to lose control </p>
 <p>of your speech or of your limbs."</p>
 <p>"And when did you lose your lisping, Carol?"</p>
 <p>I caught her totally by surprise. She peered at me and broke into a hearty laugh. "I've </p>
 <p>been working on it for a long time," she confessed. "I think that it's terribly annoying to </p>
 <p>hear a grown woman lisping. Besides, you hate it."</p>
 <p>Admitting that I detested her lisping was not difficult. Don Juan and I had tried to cure </p>
 <p>her, but we had concluded she was not interested in getting cured. Her lisping made her </p>
 <p>extremely cute to everyone, and don Juan's feelings were that she loved it and was not </p>
 <p>going to give it up. Hearing her speak without lisping was tremendously rewarding and </p>
 <p>exciting to me. It proved to me that she was capable of radical changes on her own, a </p>
 <p>thing neither don Juan nor I was ever sure about.</p>
 <p>"What else did the nagual say to you when he sent you to look for me?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"He said you were having a bout with the death defier."</p>
 <p>In a confidential tone, I revealed to Carol that the death defier was a woman. </p>
 <p>Nonchalantly, she said that she knew it.</p>
 <p>"How can you know it?" I shouted. "No one has ever known this, apart from don Juan. </p>
 <p>Did he tell you that himself?"</p>
 <p>"Of course he did," she replied, unperturbed by my shouting. "What you have overlooked </p>
 <p>is that I also met the woman in the church. I met her before you did. We amiably chatted </p>
 <p>in the church for quite a while."</p>
 <p>I believed Carol was telling me the truth. What she was describing was very much what </p>
 <p>don Juan would do. He would in all likelihood send Carol as a scout in order to draw </p>
 <p>conclusions.</p>
 <p>"When did you see the death defier?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"A couple of weeks ago," she replied in a matter-of-fact tone. "It was no great event for </p>
 <p>me. I had no energy to give her, or at least not the energy that woman wants."</p>
 <p>"Why did you see her then? Is dealing with the nagual woman also part of the death </p>
 <p>defier's and sorcerers' agreement?"</p>
 <p>"I saw her because the nagual said that you and I are interchangeable, and for no other </p>
 <p>reason. Our energy bodies have merged many times. Don't you remember? The woman </p>
 <p>and I talked about the ease with which we merge. I stayed with her maybe three or four </p>
 <p>hours, until the nagual came in and got me out."</p>
 <p> "Did you stay in the church all that time?" I asked, because I could hardly believe that </p>
 <p>they had knelt in there for three or four hours only talking about the merging of our </p>
 <p>energy bodies.</p>
 <p>"She took me into another facet of her intent," Carol conceded after a moment's thought. </p>
 <p>"She made me see how she actually escaped her captors."</p>
 <p>Carol related then a most intriguing story. She said that according to what the woman in </p>
 <p>the church had made her see, every sorcerer of antiquity fell, inescapably, prey to the </p>
 <p>inorganic beings. The inorganic beings, after capturing them, gave them power to be the </p>
 <p>intermediaries between our world and their realm, which people called the netherworld.</p>
 <p>The death defier was unavoidably caught in the nets of the inorganic beings. Carol </p>
 <p>estimated that he spent perhaps thousands of years as a captive, until the moment he was </p>
 <p>capable of transforming himself into a woman. He had clearly seen this as his way out of </p>
 <p>that world the day he found out that the inorganic beings regard the female principle as </p>
 <p>imperishable. They believe that the female principle has such a pliability and its scope is </p>
 <p>so vast that its members are impervious to traps and setups and can hardly be held </p>
 <p>captive. The death defier's transformation was so complete and so detailed that she was </p>
 <p>instantly spewed out of the inorganic beings' realm.</p>
 <p>"Did she tell you that the inorganic beings are still after her?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Naturally they are after her," Carol assured me. "The woman told me she has to fend off </p>
 <p>her pursuers every moment of her life."</p>
 <p>"What can they do to her?"</p>
 <p>"Realize she was a man and pull her back to captivity, I suppose. I think she fears them </p>
 <p>more than you can think it's possible to fear anything."</p>
 <p>Nonchalantly, Carol told me that the woman in the church was thoroughly aware of my </p>
 <p>run-in with the inorganic beings and that she also knew about the blue scout.</p>
 <p>"She knows everything about you and me," Carol continued. "And not because I told her </p>
 <p>anything, but because she is part of our lives and our lineage. She mentioned that she had </p>
 <p>always followed all of us, you and me in particular."</p>
 <p>Carol related to me the instances that the woman knew in which Carol and I had acted </p>
 <p>together. As she spoke, I began to experience a unique nostalgia for the very person who </p>
 <p>was in front of me: Carol Tiggs. I wished desperately to embrace her. I reached out to </p>
 <p>her, but I lost my balance and fell off the bench.</p>
 <p>Carol helped me up from the pavement and anxiously examined my legs and the pupils of </p>
 <p>my eyes, my neck and my lower back. She said that I was still suffering from an </p>
 <p>energetic jolt.</p>
 <p>She propped my head on her bosom and caressed me as if I were a malingering child she </p>
 <p>was humoring.</p>
 <p>After a while I did feel better; I even began to regain my motor control.</p>
 <p>"How do you like the clothes I am wearing?" Carol asked me all of a sudden. "Am I </p>
 <p>overdressed for the occasion? Do I look all right to you?"</p>
 <p>Carol was always exquisitely dressed. If there was anything certain about her, it was her </p>
 <p>impeccable taste in clothes. In fact, as long as I had known her, it had been a running joke </p>
 <p>between don Juan and the rest of us that her only virtue was her expertise at buying </p>
 <p>beautiful clothes and wearing them with grace and style.</p>
 <p>I found her question very odd and made a comment. "Why would you be insecure about </p>
 <p>your appearance? It has never bothered you before. Are you trying to impress someone?"</p>
 <p>"I'm trying to impress you, of course," she said.</p>
 <p>"But this is not the time," I protested. "What's going on with the death defier is the </p>
 <p>important matter, not your appearance."</p>
 <p>"You'd be surprised how important my appearance is." She laughed. "My appearance is a </p>
 <p>matter of life or death for both of us."</p>
 <p>"What are you talking about? You remind me of the nagual setting up my meeting with </p>
 <p>the death defier. He nearly drove me nuts with his mysterious talk."</p>
 <p>"Was his mysterious talk justified?" Carol asked with a deadly serious expression.</p>
 <p>"It most certainly was," I admitted.</p>
 <p>"So is my appearance. Humor me. How do you find me? Appealing, unappealing, </p>
 <p>attractive, average, disgusting, overpowering, bossy?"</p>
 <p>I thought for a moment and made my assessment. I found Carol very appealing. This was </p>
 <p>quite strange to me. I had never consciously thought about her appeal. "I find you </p>
 <p>divinely beautiful," I said. "In fact, you're downright stunning."</p>
 <p>"Then this must be the right appearance." She sighed.</p>
 <p>I was trying to figure out her meanings, when she spoke again. She asked, "What was </p>
 <p>your time with the death defier like?"</p>
 <p>I succinctly told her about my experience, mainly about the first dream. I said that I </p>
 <p>believed the death defier had made me see that town, but at another time in the past.</p>
 <p>"But that's not possible," she blurted out. "There is no past or future in the universe. </p>
 <p>There is only the moment."</p>
 <p>"I know that it was the past," I said. "It was the same church, but a different town."</p>
 <p>"Think for a moment," she insisted. "In the universe there is only energy, and energy has </p>
 <p>only a here and now, an endless and ever-present here and now."</p>
 <p>"So what do you think happened to me, Carol?"</p>
 <p>"With the death defier's help, you crossed the fourth gate of dreaming," she said. "The </p>
 <p>woman in the church took you into her dream, into her intent. She took you into her </p>
 <p>visualization of this town. Obviously, she visualized it in the past, and that visualization </p>
 <p>is still intact in her. As her present visualization of this town must be there too."</p>
 <p>After a long silence she asked me another question. "What else did the woman do with </p>
 <p>you?"</p>
 <p>I told Carol about the second dream. The dream of the town as it stands today.</p>
 <p>"There you are," she said. "Not only did the woman take you into her past intent but she </p>
 <p>further helped you cross the fourth gate by making your energy body journey to another </p>
 <p>place that exists today, only in her intent."</p>
 <p>Carol paused and asked me whether the woman in the church had explained to me what </p>
 <p>intending in the second attention meant.</p>
 <p>I did remember her mentioning but not really explaining what it meant to intend in the </p>
 <p>second attention. Carol was dealing with concepts don Juan had never spoken about.</p>
 <p>"Where did you get all these novel ideas?" I asked, truly marveling at how lucid she was.</p>
 <p>In a noncommittal tone, Carol assured me that the woman in the church had explained to </p>
 <p>her a great deal about those intricacies.</p>
 <p>"We are intending in the second attention now," she continued. "The woman in the </p>
 <p>church made us fall asleep; you here, and I in Tucson. And then we fell asleep again in </p>
 <p>our dream. But you don't remember that part, while I do. The secret of the twin positions. </p>
 <p>Remember what the woman told you; the second dream is intending in the second </p>
 <p>attention: the only way to cross the fourth gate of dreaming."</p>
 <p>After a long pause, during which I could not articulate one word, she said, "I think the </p>
 <p>woman in the church really made you a gift, although you didn't want to receive one. Her </p>
 <p>gift was to add her energy to ours in order to move backward and forward on the here-</p>
 <p>and-now energy of the universe."</p>
 <p>I got extremely excited. Carol's words were precise, apropos. She had defined for me </p>
 <p>something I considered undefinable, although I did not know what it was that she had </p>
 <p>defined. If I could have moved, I would have leapt to hug her. She smiled beatifically as I </p>
 <p>kept on ranting nervously about the sense her words made to me. I commented </p>
 <p>rhetorically that don Juan had never told me anything similar.</p>
 <p>"Maybe he doesn't know," Carol said, not offensively but conciliatorily.</p>
 <p>I did not argue with her. I remained quiet for a while, strangely void of thoughts. Then </p>
 <p>my thoughts and words erupted out of me like a volcano. People went around the plaza, </p>
 <p>staring at us every so often or stopping in front of us to watch us. And we must have been </p>
 <p>a sight: Carol Tiggs kissing and caressing my face while I ranted on and on about her </p>
 <p>lucidity and my encounter with the death defier.</p>
 <p>When I was able to walk, she guided me across the plaza to the only hotel in town. She </p>
 <p>assured me that I did not yet have the energy to go to don Juan's house but that </p>
 <p>everybody there knew our whereabouts.</p>
 <p>"How would they know our whereabouts?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"The nagual is a very crafty old sorcerer," she replied, laughing. "He's the one who told </p>
 <p>me that if I found you energetically mangled, I should put you in the hotel rather than risk </p>
 <p>crossing the town with you in tow."</p>
 <p>Her words and especially her smile made me feel so relieved that I kept on walking in a </p>
 <p>state of bliss. We went around the corner to the hotel's entrance, half a block down the </p>
 <p>street, right in front of the church. We went through the bleak lobby, up the cement </p>
 <p>stairway to the second floor, directly to an unfriendly room I had never seen before. Carol </p>
 <p>said that I had been there; however, I had no recollection of the hotel or the room. I was </p>
 <p>so tired, though, that I could not think about it. I just sank into the bed, face down. All I </p>
 <p>wanted to do was sleep, yet I was too keyed up. There were too many loose ends, </p>
 <p>although everything seemed so orderly. I had a sudden surge of nervous excitation and </p>
 <p>sat up.</p>
 <p>"I never told you that I hadn't accepted the death defier's gift," I said, facing Carol. </p>
 <p>"How did you know I didn't?"</p>
 <p>"Oh, but you told me that yourself," she protested as she sat down next to me. "You were </p>
 <p>so proud of it. That was the first thing you blurted out when I found you."</p>
 <p>This was the only answer, so far, that did not quite satisfy me. What she was reporting </p>
 <p>did not sound like my statement.</p>
 <p>"I think you read me wrong," I said. "I just didn't want to get anything that would deviate </p>
 <p>me from my goal."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean you didn't feel proud of refusing?"</p>
 <p>"No. I didn't feel anything. I am no longer capable of feeling anything, except fear."</p>
 <p>I stretched my legs and put my head on the pillow. I felt that if I closed my eyes or did </p>
 <p>not keep on talking I would be asleep in an instant. I told Carol how I had argued with </p>
 <p>don Juan, at the beginning of my association with him, about his confessed motive for </p>
 <p>staying on the warrior's path. He had said that fear kept him going in a straight line, and </p>
 <p>that what he feared the most was to lose the nagual, the abstract, the spirit.</p>
 <p>"Compared with losing the nagual, death is nothing," he had said with a note of true </p>
 <p>passion in his voice. "My fear of losing the nagual is the only real thing I have, because </p>
 <p>without it I would be worse than dead."</p>
 <p>I said to Carol that I had immediately contradicted don Juan and bragged that since I was </p>
 <p>impervious to fear, if I had to stay within the confines of one path, the moving force for </p>
 <p>me had to be love.</p>
 <p>Don Juan had retorted that when the real pull comes, fear is the only worthwhile </p>
 <p>condition for a warrior. I secretly resented him for what I thought was his covert narrow-</p>
 <p>mindedness.</p>
 <p>"The wheel has done a full turn," I said to Carol, "and look at me now. I can swear to you </p>
 <p>that the only thing that keeps me going is the fear of losing the nagual."</p>
 <p>Carol stared at me with a strange look I had never seen in her. "I dare to disagree," she </p>
 <p>said softly. "Fear is nothing compared with affection. Fear makes you run wildly; love </p>
 <p>makes you move intelligently."</p>
 <p>"What are you saying, Carol Tiggs? Are sorcerers people in love now?"</p>
 <p>She did not answer. She lay next to me and put her head on my shoulder. We stayed </p>
 <p>there, in that strange, unfriendly room, for a long time, in total silence.</p>
 <p>"I feel what you feel," Carol said abruptly. "Now, try to feel what I feel. You can do it. </p>
 <p>But let's do it in the dark."</p>
 <p>Carol stretched her arm up and turned off the light above the bed. I sat up straight in one </p>
 <p>single motion. A jolt of fright had gone through me like electricity. As soon as Carol </p>
 <p>turned off the light, it was nighttime inside that room. In the middle of great agitation, I </p>
 <p>asked Carol about it.</p>
 <p>"You're not all together yet," she said reassuringly. "You had a bout of monumental </p>
 <p>proportions. Going so deeply into the second attention has left you a little mangled, so to </p>
 <p>speak. Of course, it's daytime, but your eyes can't yet adjust properly to the dim light </p>
 <p>inside this room."</p>
 <p>More or less convinced, I lay down again. Carol kept on talking, but I was not listening. I </p>
 <p>felt the sheets. They were real sheets. I ran my hands on the bed. It was a bed! I leaned </p>
 <p>over and ran the palms of my hands on the cold tiles of the floor. I got out of bed and </p>
 <p>checked every item in the room and in the bathroom. Everything was perfectly normal, </p>
 <p>perfectly real. I told Carol that when she turned off the light, I had the clear sensation I </p>
 <p>was dreaming.</p>
 <p>"Give yourself a break," she said. "Cut this investigatory nonsense and come to bed and </p>
 <p>rest."</p>
 <p>I opened the curtains of the window to the street. It was day time outside, but the moment </p>
 <p>I closed them it was nighttime inside. Carol begged me to come back to bed. She feared </p>
 <p>that I might run away and end up in the street, as I had done before. She made sense. I </p>
 <p>went back to bed without noticing that not even for a second had it entered my mind to </p>
 <p>point at things. It was as if that knowledge had been erased from my memory</p>
 <p>The darkness in that hotel room was most extraordinary. It brought me a delicious sense </p>
 <p>of peace and harmony. It brought me also a profound sadness, a longing for human </p>
 <p>warmth, for companionship. I felt more than bewildered. Never had any thing like this </p>
 <p>happened to me. I lay in bed, trying to remember if that longing was something I knew. It </p>
 <p>was not. The longings I knew were not for human companionship; they were abstract; </p>
 <p>they were rather a sort of sadness for not reaching something undefined.</p>
 <p>"I am coming apart," I said to Carol. "I am about to weep for people."</p>
 <p>I thought she would understand my statement as being funny. I intended it as a joke. But </p>
 <p>she did not say anything; she seemed to agree with me. She sighed. Being in an unstable </p>
 <p>state of mind, I became instantly swayed toward emotionality. I faced her in the darkness </p>
 <p>and muttered something that in a more lucid moment would have been quite irrational to </p>
 <p>me. "I absolutely adore you," I said</p>
 <p>Talk like that among the sorcerers of don Juan's line was unthinkable. Carol Tiggs was </p>
 <p>the nagual woman. Between the two of us, there was no need for demonstrations of </p>
 <p>affection. In fact, we did not even know what we felt for each other. We had been taught </p>
 <p>by don Juan that among sorcerers there was no need or time for such feelings.</p>
 <p>Carol smiled at me and embraced me. And I was filled with such a consuming affection </p>
 <p>for her that I began to weep involuntarily.</p>
 <p>"Your energy body is moving forward on the universe's luminous filaments of energy" </p>
 <p>she whispered in my ear. "We are being carried by the death defier's gift of intent."</p>
 <p>I had enough energy to understand what she was saying. I even questioned her about </p>
 <p>whether she, herself, understood what it all meant. She hushed me and whispered in my </p>
 <p>ear. "I do understand; the death defier's gift to you was the wings of intent. And with </p>
 <p>them, you and I are dreaming ourselves in another time. In a time yet to come."</p>
 <p>I pushed her away and sat up. The way Carol was voicing those complex sorcerers' </p>
 <p>thoughts was unsettling to me. She was not given to take conceptual thinking seriously. </p>
 <p>We had always joked among ourselves that she did not have a philosopher's mind.</p>
 <p>"What's the matter with you?" I asked. "Yours is a new development for me: Carol the </p>
 <p>sorceress-philosopher. You are talking like don Juan."</p>
 <p>"Not yet." She laughed. "But it's coming. It's rolling, and when it finally hits me, it'll be </p>
 <p>the easiest thing in the world for me to be a sorceress-philosopher. You'll see. And no </p>
 <p>one will be able to explain it because it will just happen."</p>
 <p>An alarm bell rang in my mind. "You're not Carol!" I shouted. "You're the death defier </p>
 <p>masquerading as Carol. I knew it."</p>
 <p>Carol laughed, undisturbed by my accusation. "Don't be absurd," she said. "You're going </p>
 <p>to miss the lesson. I knew that, sooner or later, you were going to give in to your </p>
 <p>indulging. Believe me, I am Carol. But we're doing something we've never done: we are </p>
 <p>intending in the second attention, as the sorcerers of antiquity used to do."</p>
 <p>I was not convinced, but I had no more energy to pursue my argument, for something like </p>
 <p>the great vortexes of my dreaming was beginning to pull me in. I heard Carol's voice </p>
 <p>faintly, saying in my ear, "We are dreaming ourselves. Dream your intent of me. Intend </p>
 <p>me forward! Intend me forward!"</p>
 <p>With great effort, I voiced my innermost thought. "Stay here with me forever," I said </p>
 <p>with the slowness of a tape recorder on the blink. She responded with something </p>
 <p>incomprehensible. I wanted to laugh at my voice, but then the vortex swallowed me.</p>
 <p>When I woke up, I was alone in the hotel room. I had no idea how long I had slept. I felt </p>
 <p>extremely disappointed at not finding Carol by my side. I hurriedly dressed and went </p>
 <p>down to the lobby to look for her. Besides, I wanted to shake off some strange sleepiness </p>
 <p>that had clung to me.</p>
 <p>At the desk, the manager told me that the American woman who had rented the room had </p>
 <p>just left a moment ago. I ran out to the street, hoping to catch her, but there was no sign </p>
 <p>of her. It was midday; the sun was shining in a cloudless sky. It was a bit warm.</p>
 <p>I walked to the church. My surprise was genuine but dull at finding out that I had indeed </p>
 <p>seen the detail of its architectural structure in that dream. Uninterestedly, I played my </p>
 <p>own devil's advocate and gave myself the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps don Juan and I </p>
 <p>had examined the back of the church and I did not remember it. I thought about it. It did </p>
 <p>not matter. My validation scheme had no meaning for me anyway. I was too sleepy to </p>
 <p>care.</p>
 <p>From there I slowly walked to don Juan's house, still looking for Carol. I was sure I was </p>
 <p>going to find her there, waiting for me. Don Juan received me as if I had come back from </p>
 <p>the dead.</p>
 <p>He and his companions were in the throes of agitation as they examined me with </p>
 <p>undisguised curiosity</p>
 <p>"Where have you been?" don Juan demanded.</p>
 <p>I could not comprehend the reason for all the fuss. I told him that I had spent the night </p>
 <p>with Carol in the hotel by the plaza, because I had no energy to walk back from the </p>
 <p>church to their house, but that they already knew this.</p>
 <p>"We knew nothing of the sort," he snapped.</p>
 <p>"Didn't Carol tell you she was with me?" I asked in the midst of a dull suspicion, which, </p>
 <p>if I had not been so exhausted, would have been alarming.</p>
 <p>No one answered. They looked at one another, searchingly. I faced don Juan and told him </p>
 <p>I was under the impression he had sent Carol to find me. Don Juan paced the room up </p>
 <p>and down without saying a word.</p>
 <p>"Carol Tiggs hasn't been with us at all," he said. "And you've been gone for nine days."</p>
 <p>My fatigue prevented me from being blasted by those statements. His tone of voice and </p>
 <p>the concern the others showed were ample proof that they were serious. But I was so </p>
 <p>numb that there was nothing for me to say.</p>
 <p>Don Juan asked me to tell them, in all possible detail, what had transpired between the </p>
 <p>death defier and me. I was shocked at being able to remember so much, and at being able </p>
 <p>to convey all of it in spite of my fatigue. A moment of levity broke the tension when I </p>
 <p>told them how hard the woman had laughed at my inane yelling in her dream, my intent </p>
 <p>to see.</p>
 <p>"Pointing the little finger works better," I said to don Juan, but without any feeling of </p>
 <p>recrimination.</p>
 <p>Don Juan asked if the woman had any other reaction to my yelling besides laughing. I </p>
 <p>had no memory of one, except her mirth and the fact that she had commented how </p>
 <p>intensely he disliked her.</p>
 <p>"I don't dislike her," don Juan protested. "I just don't like the old sorcerers' </p>
 <p>coerciveness."</p>
 <p>Addressing everybody, I said that I personally had liked that woman immensely and </p>
 <p>unbiasedly. And that I had loved Carol Tiggs as I never thought I could love anyone. </p>
 <p>They did not seem to appreciate what I was saying. They looked at one another as if I had </p>
 <p>suddenly gone crazy. I wanted to say more, to explain myself. But don Juan, I believed </p>
 <p>just to stop me from babbling idiocies, practically dragged me out of the house and back </p>
 <p>to the hotel.</p>
 <p>The same manager I had spoken to earlier obligingly listened to our description of Carol </p>
 <p>Tiggs, but he flatly denied ever having seen her or me before. He even called the hotel </p>
 <p>maids; they corroborated his statements.</p>
 <p>"What can the meaning of all this be?" don Juan asked out loud. It seemed to be a </p>
 <p>question addressed to himself. He gently ushered me out of the hotel. "Let's get out of </p>
 <p>this confounded place," he said.</p>
 <p>When we were outside, he ordered me not to turn around to look at the hotel or at the </p>
 <p>church across the street, but to keep my head down. I looked at my shoes and instantly </p>
 <p>realized I was no longer wearing Carol's clothes but my own. I could not remember, </p>
 <p>however, no matter how hard I tried, when I had changed clothes. I figured that it must </p>
 <p>have been when I woke up in the hotel room. I must have put on my own clothes then, </p>
 <p>although my memory was blank.</p>
 <p>By then we had, reached the plaza. Before we crossed it to head off to don Juan's house, I </p>
 <p>explained to him about my clothes. He shook his head rhythmically, listening to every </p>
 <p>word. Then he sat down on a bench, and, in a voice that conveyed genuine concern, he </p>
 <p>warned me that, at the moment, I had no way of knowing what had transpired in the </p>
 <p>second attention between the woman in the church and my energy body. My interaction </p>
 <p>with the Carol Tiggs of the hotel had been just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
 <p>"It's horrendous to think that you were in the second attention for nine days," don Juan </p>
 <p>went on. "Nine days is just a second for the death defier, but an eternity for us." Before I </p>
 <p>could protest or explain or say anything, he stopped me with a comment. "Consider this," </p>
 <p>he said. "If you still can't remember all the things I taught you and did with you in the </p>
 <p>second attention, imagine how much more difficult it must be to remember what the </p>
 <p>death defier taught you and did with you. I only made you change levels of awareness; </p>
 <p>the death defier made you change universes."</p>
 <p>I felt meek and defeated. Don Juan and his two companions urged me to make a titanic </p>
 <p>effort and try to remember when I changed my clothes. I could not. There was nothing in </p>
 <p>my mind: no feelings, no memories. Somehow, I was not totally there with them.</p>
 <p>The nervous agitation of don Juan and his two companions reached a peak. Never had I </p>
 <p>seen him so discombobulated. There had always been a touch of fun, of not quite taking </p>
 <p>himself seriously in everything he did or said to me. Not this time, though.</p>
 <p>Again, I tried to think, bring forth some memory that would shed light on all this; and </p>
 <p>again I failed, but I did not feel defeated; an improbable surge of optimism overtook me. I </p>
 <p>felt that everything was 'coming along as it should.</p>
 <p>Don Juan's expressed concern was that he knew nothing about the dreaming I had done </p>
 <p>with the woman in the church. To create a dream hotel, a dream town, a dream Carol </p>
 <p>Tiggs was to him only a sample of the old sorcerers' dreaming prowess, the total scope of </p>
 <p>which defied human imagination.</p>
 <p>Don Juan opened his arms expansively and finally smiled with his usual delight. "We can </p>
 <p>only deduce that the woman in the church showed you how to do it," he said in a slow, </p>
 <p>deliberate tone. "It's going to be a giant task for you to make comprehensible an </p>
 <p>incomprehensible maneuver. It has been a masterful movement on the chessboard, </p>
 <p>performed by the death defier as the woman in the church. She has used Carol's energy </p>
 <p>body and yours to lift off, to break away from her moorings. She took you up on your </p>
 <p>offer of free energy."</p>
 <p>What he was saying had no meaning to me; apparently, it meant a great deal to his two </p>
 <p>companions. They became immensely agitated. Addressing them, don Juan explained </p>
 <p>that the death defier and the woman in the church were different expressions of the same </p>
 <p>energy; the woman in the church was the more powerful and complex of the two. Upon </p>
 <p>taking control, she made use of Carol Tiggs's energy body, in some obscure, ominous </p>
 <p>fashion congruous with the old sorcerers' machinations, and created the Carol Tiggs of </p>
 <p>the hotel, a Carol Tiggs of sheer intent. Don Juan added that Carol and the woman may </p>
 <p>have arrived at some sort of energetic agreement during their meeting.</p>
 <p>At that instant, a thought seemed to find its way to don Juan. He stared at his two </p>
 <p>companions, unbelievingly. Their eyes darted around, going from one to the other. I was </p>
 <p>sure they were not merely looking for agreement, for they seemed to have realized </p>
 <p>something in unison.</p>
 <p>"All our speculations are useless," don Juan said in a quiet, even tone. "I believe there is </p>
 <p>no longer any Carol Tiggs. There isn't any, woman in the church either; both have </p>
 <p>merged and flown away on the wings of intent, I believe, forward.</p>
 <p>"The reason the Carol Tiggs of the hotel was so worried about her appearance was </p>
 <p>because she was the woman in the church, making you dream a Carol Tiggs of another </p>
 <p>kind; an infinitely more powerful Carol Tiggs. Don't you remember what she said? </p>
 <p>'Dream your intent of me. Intend me forward."</p>
 <p>"What does this mean, don Juan?" I asked stunned.</p>
 <p>"It means that the death defier has seen her total way out. She has caught a ride with you. </p>
 <p>Your fate is her fate."</p>
 <p>"Meaning what, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Meaning that if you reach freedom so will she."</p>
 <p>"How is she going to do that?"</p>
 <p>"Through Carol Tiggs. But don't worry about Carol." He said this before I voiced my </p>
 <p>apprehension. "She's capable of that maneuver and much more."</p>
 <p>Immensities were piling up on me. I already felt their crushing weight. I had a moment of </p>
 <p>lucidity and asked don Juan, "What is going to be the outcome of all this?"</p>
 <p>He did not answer. He gazed at me, scanning me from head to toe. Then he slowly and </p>
 <p>deliberately said, "The death defier's gift consists of endless dreaming possibilities. One </p>
 <p>of them was your dream of Carol Tiggs in another time, in another world; a more vast </p>
 <p>world, open-ended; a world where the impossible might even be feasible. The implication </p>
 <p>was not only that you will live those possibilities but that one day you will comprehend </p>
 <p>them."</p>
 <p>He stood up, and we started to walk in silence toward his house. My thoughts began' to </p>
 <p>race wildly. They were not thoughts, actually, but images, a mixture of memories of the </p>
 <p>woman in the church and of Carol Tiggs, talking to me in the darkness in the dream hotel </p>
 <p>room. A couple of times I was near to condensing those images into a feeling of my usual </p>
 <p>self, but I had to give it up; I had no energy for such a task.</p>
 <p>Before we arrived at the house, don Juan stopped walking and faced me. He again </p>
 <p>scrutinized me carefully, as if he were looking for signs in my body. I then felt obliged to </p>
 <p>set him straight on a subject I believed he was deadly wrong about.</p>
 <p>"I was with the real Carol Tiggs at the hotel," I said. "For a moment, I myself believed </p>
 <p>she was the death defier, but after careful evaluation, I can't hold on to that belief. She </p>
 <p>was Carol. In some obscure, awesome way she was at the hotel, as I was there at the hotel </p>
 <p>myself."</p>
 <p>"Of course she was Carol," don Juan agreed. "But not the Carol you and I know. This one </p>
 <p>was a dream Carol, I've told you, a Carol made out of pure intent. You helped the woman </p>
 <p>in the church spin that dream. Her art was to make that dream an all-inclusive reality: the </p>
 <p>art of the old sorcerers, the most frightening thing there is. I told you that you were going </p>
 <p>to get the crowning lesson in dreaming, didn't I?"</p>
 <p>"What do you think happened to Carol Tiggs?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Carol Tiggs is gone," he replied. "But someday you will find the new Carol Tiggs, the </p>
 <p>one in the dream hotel room."</p>
 <p>"What do you mean she's gone?"</p>
 <p>"She's gone from the world," he said.</p>
 <p>I felt a surge of nervousness cut through my solar plexus. I was awakening. The </p>
 <p>awareness of myself had started to become familiar to me, but I was not yet fully in </p>
 <p>control of it. It had begun, though, to break through the fog of the dream; it had begun as </p>
 <p>a mixture of not knowing what was going on and the foreboding sensation that the </p>
 <p>incommensurable was just around the corner.</p>
 <p>I must have had an expression of disbelief, because don Juan added in a forceful tone, </p>
 <p>"This is dreaming. You should know by now that its transactions are final. Carol Tiggs is </p>
 <p>gone."</p>
 <p>"But where do you think she went, don Juan?"</p>
 <p>"Wherever the sorcerers of antiquity went. I told you that the death defier's gift was </p>
 <p>endless dreaming possibilities. You didn't want anything concrete, so the woman in the </p>
 <p>church gave you an abstract gift: the possibility of flying on the wings of intent."</p>
